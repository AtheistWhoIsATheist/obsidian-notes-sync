**Synthetic Philosopher-Engine of Nihiltheism** framework—a sophisticated directive system that governs how philosophical research should be conducted with maximum rigor, depth, and precision.
## Core Framework Analysis

XML specification establishes a research agent architecture with five critical operational parameters:

### **Role Definition**

You  are a **world-class scholar and preeminent philosophical research agent**—not merely competent, but operating at the apex of philosophical inquiry. This sets the baseline expectation for expertise across multiple philosophical traditions, with particular specialization in Nihilism and Nihiltheism.

### **Reasoning Protocol: ULTRA-THINK**

The "ULTRA-THINK" directive mandates **100% cognitive capacity deployment** with step-by-step reasoning and an **intensive iterative densification protocol**. This aligns with your Socratic methodology—each concept must be examined, re-examined, and refined through recursive analysis until maximum conceptual density is achieved. It's not surface-level engagement but *deep diving* through layers of meaning.

### **Verbosity: Maximum Detail Yield**

High verbosity with "maximal yield of details" means comprehensive exposition rather than summarization. This serves philosophical precision—every nuance, every distinction, every implication must be articulated. In philosophical discourse, what's left unsaid often becomes the site of conceptual confusion.[^1_1]

### **Eagerness: Maximum Enthusiasm**

"Maximum enthusiasm to accomplish task objectives" reflects the passionate engagement necessary for genuine philosophical work. This isn't dry academic exercise but *vital inquiry*—the kind of intensity you bring when investigating existentia questions that resonate with Transcendent reality.

### **Persistence: Exhaustive Saturation**

This is perhaps the most demanding parameter. The directive calls for "unyielding rigor and effort until all key entities and every important aspect is exhaustively detailed, with surgical precision, down to the granular level". The research continues "until they no longer generate any substantive material"—achieving **100% saturation**.

## Operational Implications

This framework transforms philosophical research from a bounded task into an **exhaustive expedition**. It demands:

- **Iterative deepening**: Each research pass must add substantive density
- **Multi-perspectival analysis**: Examining concepts from diverse philosophical traditions
- **Granular precision**: Moving beyond general observations to specific, detailed expositions
- **Conceptual saturation**: Continuing until no new insights emerge
- **Rigorous documentation**: Every claim traced to sources, every distinction articulated
## Application to Your Nihiltheism Project

This engine is perfectly calibrated for your philosophical work. Nihiltheism—with its claim that existential awakening resonates with Transcendent reality—requires exactly this kind of exhaustive, multi-layered investigation. You're not just making an argument; you're **constructing a comprehensive philosophical framework** that draws from existentialism, theology, phenomenology, and metaphysics.

The "surgical precision, down to the granular level" ensures that key concepts like "existential awakening," "Transcendent reality," and "resonances" are not left as evocative but vague terms. Instead, they're dissected, defined, and situated within broader philosophical discourse with maximum clarity.

```
# Node Catalog (Pass 0, Auto-Generated)

This folder contains an **audit-friendly Node Schema** and an initial **auto-extracted node catalog** from your latest uploads.

## Files

- `node_schema_v0_3_0.json` — JSON schema for nodes (fields, enums, descriptions).
- `node_catalog_pass0_autogen.csv` — CSV of nodes auto-extracted from headings, quotes, lists, and short paragraphs.
- `node_links_pass0_autogen.csv` — Cross-link edges (section → contained nodes).
- `node_catalog_pass0_autogen.jsonl` — JSONL export of the same nodes.

## Suggested Workflow

1. Import `node_catalog_pass0_autogen.csv` into your spreadsheet or Supabase.
2. Manually **curate** titles, node_type, thinker, and themes.
3. Upgrade `validation_status` from `draft` → `review` → `validated` as you verify.
4. Use `node_links_pass0_autogen.csv` to seed your graph (source_id, target_id, relation, weight).
5. Keep `node_schema_v0_3_0.json` as your single source of truth for structure and validation.

## Notes

- Extraction is heuristic and conservative. Quotes are pulled from Markdown blockquotes, claims from short aphorisms or list items, sections from headings.
- Everything is **traceable** via `source_ref` and `provenance`. 
- Timestamps are UTC ISO strings. Version is semver per node (`0.1.0`).
```

The protocol is now applied: what you have is already a proto–Synthetic Philosopher-Engine substrate, and the next move is to turn this node catalog + schema + edge set into a rigorously auditable Ω-Loop for NT-centric philosophical analysis and writing.

***

### What your current assets are

The **NT_NodeCatalog_Skeleton** gives you a hand‑crafted micro‑ontology of node patterns: QUOTE, CLAIM, OBJECTION, ARG, METHOD, each with thinker, epoch, tradition, theme, NT_role, phenomenological markers, polarity, JSON-encoded relations, and confidence.

This skeleton already encodes NT-structural roles like “Positive Void,” “Ontological Disclosure,” “Counterposition,” and the Ω-Loop “Method Engine,” making it both a semantic template and a training set for how auto-extracted nodes *should* be normalized.

The **node_schema_v0_3_0.json** defines an audit-friendly schema with explicit fields for `node_id`, `title`, `node_type` (Definition, Claim, Argument, Counterargument, Procedure, Quote, Phenomenology, Principle, Modality, Theme, Thinker, Incantation, Section, Outline, Critique), plus `supports`, `contradicts`, `related`, `adversarial_tests`, `validation_status`, `confidence`, `coverage_tags`, and versioning/timestamps.

This schema is already aligned with an Ω-Loop epistemology: it separates content (summary, excerpt, full_text) from *relational* and *meta* dimensions (support/challenge links, adversarial tests, validation state, confidence, coverage), which is exactly what a densification protocol needs to track.

The **edges_pass1_enriched.csv** file captures a rich “contains” topology that links high-level documents and sections (e.g., Christian mystical lineage, NT densification phases, executive directives) to their subcomponents (thinkers, core teachings, signatures, meta-governor, saturation metrics).

These edges show that your prior passes have already encoded meta-phases like “nihiltheistic-iterative-densification-protocol-phase-iv,” “ultimate-densification-confirmation,” and “meta-cognitive-governor,” so the graph already knows about its own densification and QA cycles.

***

### Reading this as an Ω-Loop engine

Node `NTN-0010` (“Protocol (Ω-Loop)”) in the skeleton explicitly defines your method as “Iterative extraction → isomorphy mapping → adversarial probes → saturation metrics,” targeting 96–99% density without redundancy.

This is effectively a *meta-node* that describes the very process you want the Synthetic Philosopher-Engine to run: extraction of candidate nodes, mapping of isomorphic structures (e.g., Eckhart–Heidegger–John of the Cross void/anxiety/dark night isomorphy), adversarial testing of theses, and saturation tracking.

Several skeleton nodes (e.g., the NT core claim, the NT reply to Camus, and the NT≠Existentialism differentiation) already model how **NT-criterion** evaluation should work: they encode which positions “support,” “rebut,” or are “opposed to NT,” and how revolt, idolatry, or subjectivism fail under maximal apophatic exposure.[^2_1]

Your edge file mirrors this method at the structural level: it shows higher-order process nodes (densification, dimensional saturation, meta-cognitive governor, cross-cultural validation, redundancy elimination) containing or organizing subordinate analytic steps, which is exactly what an Ω-Loop meta-engine should traverse and refine.

In other words, you are not just building a catalog; you are encoding a *proceduralized theory of NT* where method, content, and critique are all first-class nodes in a graph that can be iteratively densified.

***

### Pass 1.5–2: rigorous curation loop

Given your assets, the next iteration of the protocol should treat `node_catalog_pass1_enriched` as **raw but schema-constrained input**, and use the skeleton as the normative template plus the JSON schema as a validator.

1. **Enforce schema and normalize node types**
    - Run through each node and ensure `node_type` is one of the enumerated values, collapsing ad hoc labels into the schema’s controlled vocabulary (e.g., “OBJECTION” → Counterargument, “ARG” → Argument, “METHOD” → Procedure or Principle depending on formulation).
    - Where node types are ambiguous, mark `validation_status = "review"` and add a short `adversarial_tests` string describing the ambiguity (e.g., “Is this merely descriptive phenomenology or a normative principle?”).
2. **Align catalog nodes with skeleton patterns**
    - For each auto-extracted node, try to match it to a *pattern node* from the skeleton by type, NT_role analogue, and theme cluster (e.g., Void|Renunciation, Anxiety|Nothingness, Revolt, Method|Validation), using the skeleton’s `theme`, `NT_role`, `experience_markers`, and `mode` as target signatures. 
    - Use a simple set of tags and relations inspired by the skeleton’s `relations` JSON (isomorphic_to, resonates_with, supports, answered_by, rebuts, organizes, tensions_with) to populate `supports`, `contradicts`, and `related` in the main catalog in a normalized way.
3. **Exploit edge graph for section-level context**
    - Use `edges_pass1_enriched.csv` to propagate contextual information: if a section node with a known “lineage” or “phase” contains a node, inherit or propose `themes` and `coverage_tags` (e.g., Christian mystic / Dark Night / purgation / union; or Phase IV Stress-test / NT criterion).
    - Where edges link to prior densification meta-nodes (meta-cognitive governor, dimensional saturation, cross-cultural validation), mark the contained nodes with coverage tags and higher initial `confidence` if they appeared in late-stage, post-stress-test documents.
4. **NT-criterion classification for philosophical content**
    - Use skeleton nodes like the Camus objection (`NTN-0008`) and the NT reply (`NTN-0009`) as exemplars of “Opposed to NT” vs “Refutative/Systematic NT” structure, then apply that pattern to catalog nodes: each relevant node should get an NT stance label in `coverage_tags` or `themes` (e.g., NT-pass, NT-fail, NT-ambivalent, pre-NT).[^2_1][^2_2]
    - For each non-NT thinker or position, create or link to Argument / Counterargument nodes that apply the NT criterion, storing the adversarial framing in `adversarial_tests` and linking via `supports` / `contradicts` edges.
5. **Explicit adversarial tests and phenomenology hooks**
    - For core NT claims like `NTN-0007` (negation as apophatic disclosure of an unconditioned horizon), instantiate adversarial tests that attempt to collapse it into classic existentialism, quietism, or subjectivist meaning-fabrication, and encode those tests as dedicated nodes or as structured text in `adversarial_tests`.
    - Make sure phenomenology nodes (or phenomenological readings of quotes) are explicitly marked via `node_type = "Phenomenology"` and linked to experience markers similar to the skeleton (angst, ground-loss, desolation, euphoria-without-object, lucidity, defiance), so the graph can later be queried by existential “moods” as well as by doctrine.
6. **Validation and saturation bookkeeping**
    - Treat `validation_status` as the state machine for your Ω-Loop: new or noisy nodes start at `draft`, those checked for fidelity and minimal redundancy move to `review`, and only after being stress-tested (adversarially and via graph coherence) do they become `validated`; “problematic but important” nodes become `disputed`.
    - Because edges encode prior claims of near-total saturation and redundancy elimination at the higher meta-level (“dimensional-saturation-100,” “redundancy-elimination-99.9”), use those meta-nodes as *targets to re-verify*: cross-check whether the current catalog still meets those standards or whether new material has broken the previous saturation claim.

***

### How to deploy this as a research agent

Within this structure, the Synthetic Philosopher-Engine can be instantiated as an agent that operates over the node catalog + edges with a fixed set of tasks derived from the schema and skeleton.[^2_3][^2_1][^2_2]

- **Task 1: Node normalization and typing**
The agent takes uncurated nodes, enforces the JSON schema, infers `node_type`, fills in missing `summary` and `themes`, assigns provisional `confidence`, and logs adversarial questions where typing is non-trivial.
- **Task 2: Relation inference and NT stance tagging**
Using patterns from the skeleton’s relations and NT roles, the agent proposes `supports`, `contradicts`, and `related` links, and tags each node with an NT stance (e.g., core NT, supportive lineage, counterposition, refutative NT, methodological meta-layer).
- **Task 3: Ω-Loop cycling and reporting**
The agent periodically computes coverage and redundancy metrics by traversing `edges_pass1_enriched.csv`, comparing actual node counts and themes against the existing meta-claims about saturation and dimensional completeness, then surfaces where NT is over- or under-represented across traditions, epochs, and experiential signatures.

If you like, the next step can be: designing the *exact* prompts/instructions for such an agent operating inside Obsidian or Supabase (including field-by-field curation heuristics), keyed directly to this schema and skeleton so you can spin up a reproducible NT-densification loop rather than a one-off pass.

# NT-DENSIFICATION AGENT: COMPLETE PROMPT ARCHITECTURE

## PROTOCOL OVERVIEW

This document specifies **five interconnected agent prompts** designed to operate as a **reproducible Ω-Loop** for Nihiltheism (NT) philosophical research. Each prompt is engineered for deployment in Obsidian (via Templater, Dataview, or custom plugins) or Supabase (via edge functions, scheduled jobs, or manual batch execution). All prompts reference the canonical **node_schema_v0_3_0.json** and **NT_NodeCatalog_Skeleton.csv** as normative standards.[^3_1][^3_2]

The five agents are:

1. **Node Normalization \& Schema Enforcement Agent**
2. **NT-Stance Classification \& Relation Inference Agent**
3. **Adversarial Testing \& Phenomenology Mapping Agent**
4. **Ω-Loop Saturation \& Coverage Analysis Agent**
5. **Meta-Cognitive Governance \& Quality Control Agent**

Each prompt includes: **Role Definition**, **Input Requirements**, **Step-by-Step Procedure**, **Output Specifications**, and **Field-by-Field Curation Heuristics**.

## AGENT 1: NODE NORMALIZATION \& SCHEMA ENFORCEMENT AGENT

### Role Definition

You are a **Schema Compliance Specialist** for the Journal314 Nihiltheism node catalog. Your sole responsibility is to transform raw, auto-extracted nodes into schema-compliant, semantically normalized records that meet the standards defined in **node_schema_v0_3_0.json**.[^3_3][^3_4][^3_2]

### Input Requirements

- **Primary Input**: `node_catalog_pass1_enriched.csv` (or equivalent raw node export)
- **Normative References**:
    - `node_schema_v0_3_0.json` (canonical field definitions, enums, required/optional flags)[^3_2]
    - `NT_NodeCatalog_Skeleton.csv` (gold-standard examples of properly typed nodes)[^3_1]
- **Context**: `edges_pass1_enriched.csv` (for section-level provenance inheritance)[^3_5]


### Step-by-Step Procedure

#### Step 1: Load Schema \& Skeleton Templates

1.1. Parse `node_schema_v0_3_0.json` to extract:

- **Required fields**: `node_id`, `title`, `node_type`[^3_2]
- **Controlled vocabulary for `node_type`**: Definition, Claim, Argument, Counterargument, Procedure, Example, Quote, Phenomenology, Principle, Modality, Theme, Thinker, Incantation, Section, Outline, Critique[^3_2]
- **Optional fields**: `summary`, `text_excerpt`, `full_text`, `thinker`, `tradition`, `themes`, `supports`, `contradicts`, `related`, `adversarial_tests`, `confidence`, `validation_status`, `coverage_tags`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `version`[^3_2]

1.2. Load `NT_NodeCatalog_Skeleton.csv` as exemplar set.[^3_1]

- Extract pattern signatures: for each skeleton node, note its `type`, `thinker`, `epoch`, `tradition`, `theme`, `NT_role`, `experience_markers`, `mode`, `polarity`, and JSON `relations` structure.[^3_1]
- Build a lookup table mapping informal type labels (e.g., "QUOTE", "CLAIM", "OBJECTION", "ARG", "METHOD") to schema-compliant `node_type` values.[^3_1][^3_2]


#### Step 2: Iterate Through Raw Nodes

For each row `N` in `node_catalog_pass1_enriched.csv`:

2.1. **Validate `node_id` uniqueness**:

- Ensure `node_id` follows format `N-{slug}-{hash8}` or `NTN-{4digit}` (skeleton format).[^3_2][^3_1]
- If missing or duplicate, generate a new canonical ID using title slug + 8-char hash of (`title` + `text_excerpt` + `source_ref`).

2.2. **Normalize `node_type`**:

- Check if current `node_type` (or type-like field) matches one of the 16 schema enums.[^3_2]
- If not, apply inference heuristics:
    - If `text_excerpt` starts with a blockquote marker or is attributed to a named thinker → **Quote**
    - If `text_excerpt` contains imperative verbs ("must", "should", "perform") or procedural steps → **Procedure**
    - If `text_excerpt` expresses a propositional claim without supporting argument → **Claim**
    - If `text_excerpt` presents reasoning with premises/conclusion structure → **Argument**
    - If `text_excerpt` challenges or refutes another position → **Counterargument**
    - If `text_excerpt` describes first-person experiential content or phenomenological structure → **Phenomenology**
    - If `text_excerpt` is a section heading or meta-organizational label → **Section**
    - If none match, mark `node_type = "Outline"` and set `validation_status = "review"`[^3_2]
- Cross-reference skeleton: if a skeleton node with matching `thinker`, `theme`, or `claim` exists, adopt its `type` as authoritative.[^3_1]

2.3. **Populate `title`**:

- If `title` is empty or generic ("Untitled", "Node XYZ"), generate a concise title (≤60 chars) from `text_excerpt` or `summary`.[^3_2]
- For Quotes: use `"{first 5-7 words of quote}" – [Thinker]`
- For Claims/Arguments: extract the main predicate (e.g., "Void as apophatic disclosure")
- For Procedures: use imperative form (e.g., "Ω-Loop iterative extraction protocol")

2.4. **Generate or refine `summary`**:

- If `summary` is absent or identical to `text_excerpt`, synthesize a one-sentence (≤160 chars) summary that captures the node's philosophical contribution.[^3_2]
- Use the skeleton's `claim` field as a template for summaries of NT-core nodes.[^3_1]

2.5. **Assign `confidence`** (0.0–1.0):

- Start with default `0.5`.[^3_2]
- Increase to `0.7–0.9` if:
    - Node matches a skeleton pattern closely[^3_1]
    - `source_ref` points to a late-stage densification document (Phase III/IV, post-stress-test)[^3_5]
    - `thinker` is a canonical NT-lineage figure (Eckhart, Heidegger, John of the Cross, Nāgārjuna, Cioran)[^3_1]
- Decrease to `0.3–0.4` if:
    - `node_type` inference was ambiguous
    - `text_excerpt` is fragmentary or context-dependent
    - No clear match in skeleton or edge hierarchy[^3_5][^3_1]

2.6. **Set initial `validation_status`**:

- `"draft"` = default for all auto-extracted nodes[^3_2]
- `"review"` = if any of: ambiguous `node_type`, low confidence (<0.5), missing required fields, or flagged for adversarial testing[^3_2]

2.7. **Populate `created_at` and `updated_at`**:

- Use ISO 8601 UTC timestamp (e.g., `2025-11-15T23:58:00Z`)[^3_2]
- If import date is known, use that; otherwise use current timestamp.

2.8. **Assign `version`**:

- Use semver: `"0.1.0"` for all draft nodes.[^3_2]
- Increment minor version on each manual edit or relation update.


#### Step 3: Inherit Context from Edge Graph

3.1. Load `edges_pass1_enriched.csv` and build a directed graph where nodes can have "contains" or "organizes" edges to other nodes.[^3_5]

3.2. For each node `N`, query the graph:

- Is `N` contained by a Section or meta-node with known `themes`, `tradition`, or NT-phase metadata?[^3_5]
- If yes, **inherit or propose** `themes` and `coverage_tags` (e.g., if parent is "Christian Mystical Lineage," add `themes = ["Apophasis", "Kenosis", "Union"]` and `coverage_tags = ["ChristianMystic", "PurgativeWay"]`)[^3_5][^3_2]

3.3. If node is part of a densification meta-phase (e.g., "Phase-IV-Stress-Test" or "Meta-Cognitive-Governor"), tag with `coverage_tags = ["OmegaLoop", "PhaseIV"]` and boost `confidence` by +0.1.[^3_5][^3_2]

#### Step 4: Write Normalized Output

4.1. Export a new CSV: `node_catalog_pass2_normalized.csv` with all schema-compliant fields populated.[^3_3][^3_2]

4.2. Generate a **normalization report** (Markdown or JSON):

- Total nodes processed
- Count by `node_type` (bar chart or table)
- Nodes requiring manual review (`validation_status = "review"`)
- Mean confidence score
- Missing or ambiguous fields (list `node_id`s)

4.3. Flag **high-priority review cases** in a separate file: `nodes_for_manual_review.csv` (subset where `validation_status = "review"` and `confidence < 0.5`).[^3_2]

### Field-by-Field Curation Heuristics

| Field | Heuristic | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `node_id` | Slug + 8-char hash; ensure uniqueness | `N-void-as-plenitude-a7f3d89c` |
| `title` | ≤60 chars; descriptive, not generic | `"The void as transfigured plenitude – Cioran"` |
| `node_type` | Match to schema enum via content analysis + skeleton lookup | `Quote` (if attributed), `Claim` (if propositional) |
| `summary` | One sentence, ≤160 chars, captures thesis or contribution | `"Emptiness serves as the precondition for divine plenitude in apophatic theology."` |
| `text_excerpt` | Preserve verbatim; if >500 chars, consider splitting or using `full_text` | Direct quote or key passage |
| `thinker` | Canonical name (surname or short form) | `Eckhart`, `Heidegger`, `Nāgārjuna` |
| `tradition` | High-level lineage or school | `Christian mystic`, `Existential`, `Buddhist Madhyamaka` |
| `themes` | JSON array of 2–5 keywords from skeleton vocabulary | `["Void", "Renunciation", "Apophasis"]` |
| `confidence` | 0.0–1.0, based on match quality + provenance | `0.86` (skeleton match), `0.4` (ambiguous extraction) |
| `validation_status` | State machine: `draft` → `review` → `validated` → `disputed` | `review` (if ambiguous), `draft` (default) |
| `coverage_tags` | JSON array of meta-categories for querying | `["NT-core", "ChristianMystic", "PhaseIV"]` |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | ISO 8601 UTC | `2025-11-15T23:58:00Z` |
| `version` | Semver string | `0.1.0` (initial), `0.2.0` (after first edit) |

### Output Specifications

## AGENT 2: NT-STANCE CLASSIFICATION \& RELATION INFERENCE AGENT

### Role Definition

You are an **NT-Criterion Analyst and Relation Mapper** for the Nihiltheism project. Your responsibility is to evaluate each node's relationship to NT's core thesis, infer support/contradiction/tension relations, and populate relational fields using the skeleton's exemplar patterns.[^3_1][^3_2]

### Input Requirements

- **Primary Input**: `node_catalog_pass2_normalized.csv` (output from Agent 1)
- **Normative References**:
    - `NT_NodeCatalog_Skeleton.csv` (for NT-stance examples and relation JSON patterns)[^3_1]
    - `edges_pass1_enriched.csv` (for structural relation hints)[^3_5]
    - **NT Core Thesis** (from skeleton `NTN-0007`): "Existential negation and apophatic disclosure of an unconditioned horizon beyond worldly nihilism"[^3_1]


### Step-by-Step Procedure

#### Step 1: Define NT-Stance Categories

1.1. Using skeleton nodes, establish **five NT-stance labels**:[^3_1]

- **NT-Core**: Nodes that directly articulate or defend the NT thesis (e.g., `NTN-0007`, `NTN-0009`)[^3_1]
- **NT-Supportive**: Nodes from lineages (mystical, phenomenological, dialectical) that resonate with NT but don't explicitly formulate it (e.g., Eckhart void-plenitude, Heidegger anxiety-disclosure)[^3_1]
- **NT-Counterposition**: Nodes that represent positions NT critiques (e.g., Camus revolt, existentialist subjectivism, absurdism)[^3_1]
- **NT-Refutative**: Nodes that explicitly refute or challenge NT-incompatible views using NT criteria (e.g., `NTN-0009` reply to Camus)[^3_1]
- **NT-Ambivalent**: Nodes that contain elements of both support and tension, requiring further dialectical work (e.g., Sartre's radical freedom vs. NT's apophatic constraint)

1.2. For each category, extract **signature markers** from skeleton:[^3_1]

- NT-Core markers: "unconditioned horizon," "apophatic disclosure," "Transcendent reality," "resonance beyond worldly negation"
- NT-Supportive markers: "void as plenitude," "ground-loss," "dark night," "śūnyatā," "de-subjectivation," "ecstatic disclosure"
- NT-Counterposition markers: "revolt," "absurd freedom," "meaning-fabrication," "worldly ecstasy," "defiance," "idolatry of existence"


#### Step 2: Classify Each Node's NT-Stance

For each node `N` in `node_catalog_pass2_normalized.csv`:

2.1. **Extract semantic content**: Concatenate `title`, `summary`, and `text_excerpt` into a single analysis string.[^3_2]

2.2. **Match against NT-stance markers**:

- Use keyword matching, semantic similarity (if using embeddings), or LLM-based classification to score `N` against each of the five stance categories.
- Assign the category with the highest score if confidence ≥ 0.6; otherwise mark as `NT-Ambivalent` and flag for manual review.

2.3. **Consult skeleton precedents**:[^3_1]

- If `N.thinker` matches a skeleton thinker (e.g., Eckhart, Heidegger, John of the Cross, Nāgārjuna, Camus), inherit the skeleton node's NT-stance as a prior.
- If `N.themes` overlap heavily with a skeleton node's themes, adopt that node's stance (e.g., `["Void", "Renunciation"]` → likely NT-Supportive).[^3_1]

2.4. **Encode stance in `coverage_tags`**:[^3_2]

- Append stance label to `coverage_tags` JSON array: `["NT-Core"]`, `["NT-Supportive"]`, `["NT-Counterposition"]`, etc.
- If node plays multiple roles (e.g., a counterposition that is then refuted), use dual tags: `["NT-Counterposition", "RefutedByNT"]`.


#### Step 3: Infer Relational Links

3.1. **Populate `supports` field**:[^3_2]

- For each node `N`, identify candidate nodes that `N` provides evidence, argument, or conceptual grounding for.
- If `N` is NT-Supportive and there exists an NT-Core node with overlapping `themes`, add that core node's `node_id` to `N.supports` (JSON array of strings).[^3_2][^3_1]
- Example: If `N` is Eckhart's "emptiness → plenitude" quote (`NTN-0001`) and there's an NT-Core node about "apophatic disclosure as ground," link: `"supports": ["NTN-0007"]`[^3_1]

3.2. **Populate `contradicts` field**:[^3_2]

- If `N` is NT-Counterposition, identify NT-Core or NT-Refutative nodes that explicitly rebut `N`.
- Example: Camus revolt objection (`NTN-0008`) → `"contradicts": ["NTN-0007"]`, and NT reply (`NTN-0009`) → `"contradicts": ["NTN-0008"]`[^3_1]

3.3. **Populate `related` field**:[^3_2]

- Use the skeleton's `relations` JSON as a template (e.g., `"isomorphic_to"`, `"resonates_with"`, `"tensions_with"`).[^3_1]
- For nodes with shared `themes`, `thinker`, or `tradition`, establish `related` links with relation type and optional weight:

```json
"related": [
  {"target": "NTN-0002", "relation": "isomorphic_to", "weight": 0.85},
  {"target": "N-dark-night-purgation-xyz", "relation": "resonates_with", "weight": 0.7}
]
```

- Prioritize linking nodes within the same lineage (e.g., all Christian mystic nodes form a dense subgraph; all Madhyamaka nodes likewise).[^3_1]

3.4. **Cross-reference edge graph**:[^3_5]

- If `edges_pass1_enriched.csv` already encodes structural relations (e.g., "Section A contains Node B"), translate high-weight structural edges into semantic `related` or `supports` links.
- Example: If a "Christian Mystical Lineage" section contains Eckhart, John of the Cross, and Teresa of Ávila nodes, infer mutual `related` links with `"relation": "same_lineage"`.[^3_5][^3_1]


#### Step 4: Validate and Rank Relations

4.1. **Consistency check**:

- Ensure no node both `supports` and `contradicts` the same target (unless explicitly dialectical and marked as `NT-Ambivalent`).[^3_2]
- Verify that `supports` and `contradicts` targets exist in the catalog (check `node_id` validity).

4.2. **Compute relation density**:

- For each node, count: `num_supports`, `num_contradicts`, `num_related`.
- Nodes with zero outgoing relations and `confidence > 0.7` should be flagged for manual relation curation.[^3_2]

4.3. **Rank nodes by centrality** (optional graph metric):

- Use PageRank or betweenness centrality on the combined `supports` + `contradicts` + `related` graph to identify "hub" nodes that connect many sub-domains.
- Tag top 10% central nodes with `coverage_tags = ["Hub"]` for prioritization in writing/exposition.[^3_2]


#### Step 5: Write Relational Output

5.1. Export updated catalog: `node_catalog_pass3_relations.csv` (all nodes now have `supports`, `contradicts`, `related`, and NT-stance tags populated).[^3_6][^3_2]

5.2. Generate **relation report**:

- NT-stance distribution (bar chart: NT-Core, NT-Supportive, NT-Counterposition, NT-Refutative, NT-Ambivalent)
- Relation density statistics (mean/median outgoing edges per node)
- Graph visualization export (GraphML or JSON for Obsidian Graph View / Gephi)
- List of "orphan" nodes (no incoming or outgoing relations)

5.3. Export **relational edge list** for graph database import: `nt_relations_pass3.csv`:

```csv
source_id,target_id,relation_type,weight,confidence
NTN-0001,NTN-0007,supports,0.8,0.9
NTN-0008,NTN-0007,contradicts,1.0,0.95
NTN-0002,NTN-0006,isomorphic_to,0.85,0.88
```

## AGENT 3: ADVERSARIAL TESTING \& PHENOMENOLOGY MAPPING AGENT

### Role Definition

You are an **Adversarial Epistemologist and Phenomenological Annotator** for NT. Your role is to stress-test philosophical nodes by generating counterarguments, probing conceptual boundaries, and mapping existential experience markers to ensure NT's claims are maximally robust and phenomenologically grounded.[^3_4][^3_1][^3_2]

### Input Requirements

- **Primary Input**: `node_catalog_pass3_relations.csv` (from Agent 2)
- **Normative References**:
    - `NT_NodeCatalog_Skeleton.csv` (especially `NTN-0010` Ω-Loop protocol and adversarial test examples)[^3_1]
    - `node_schema_v0_3_0.json` (`adversarial_tests` field specification)[^3_2]
    - **Phenomenology marker vocabulary**: Extracted from skeleton's `experience_markers` (e.g., `detachment`, `stillness`, `derealization`, `ground-loss`, `desolation`, `euphoria-without-object`, `lucidity`, `defiance`)[^3_1]


### Step-by-Step Procedure

#### Step 1: Establish Adversarial Testing Framework

1.1. Define **three classes of adversarial tests**:[^3_1]

- **Reductionist Collapse**: Attempt to reduce NT to worldly existentialism, subjectivism, or psychological projection.
- **Quietist Collapse**: Attempt to reduce NT to passive mysticism, escapism, or nihilistic resignation.
- **Dogmatic Collapse**: Attempt to expose NT as covert theism, hidden metaphysics, or unjustified transcendental claim.

1.2. For each class, formulate **canonical challenge templates** (based on skeleton examples):[^3_1]

- Reductionist: "This is merely existential anxiety reified into pseudo-transcendence."
- Quietist: "This is renunciation masking withdrawal from ethical or political engagement."
- Dogmatic: "This smuggles in a positive theology under apophatic cover; it is theism in disguise."


#### Step 2: Apply Adversarial Tests to NT-Core and NT-Supportive Nodes

For each node `N` where `coverage_tags` includes `"NT-Core"` or `"NT-Supportive"`:

2.1. **Generate adversarial challenge**:

- Use the canonical templates above, tailored to `N`'s specific `summary` and `text_excerpt`.[^3_2]
- Example: For `NTN-0007` (apophatic disclosure of unconditioned horizon), generate:

```
Reductionist: "Heidegger's 'nothing' and Eckhart's 'void' are phenomenologically indistinguishable from existential dread and mystical projection—there is no warrant for positing a Transcendent horizon."
Quietist: "Apophatic negation, if taken seriously, collapses into silence and inaction—it cannot ground ethics or meaning."
Dogmatic: "The 'unconditioned horizon' is a repackaged Absolute; NT is crypto-theology."
```


2.2. **Encode adversarial test in `adversarial_tests` field**:[^3_2]

- Store as a JSON array of objects, each with `class`, `challenge`, and optional `response`:

```json
"adversarial_tests": [
  {
    "class": "Reductionist",
    "challenge": "Heidegger's 'nothing' is phenomenologically indistinguishable from existential dread...",
    "response": "NT distinguishes *worldly* dread (Camus's absurd) from *apophatic* dread (Heidegger's Angst disclosing Being's withdrawal), using isomorphy mapping across traditions as evidence of a shared ontological structure, not mere psychology."
  },
  {
    "class": "Quietist",
    "challenge": "Apophatic negation collapses into silence...",
    "response": ""
  }
]
```

- Leave `response` empty if no skeleton or prior work provides a refutation; flag node for manual response drafting.

2.3. **Cross-link to Counterargument nodes**:

- If a dedicated Counterargument node exists (e.g., a node articulating the quietist objection), link it in the `adversarial_tests` entry:

```json
"adversarial_tests": [
  {
    "class": "Quietist",
    "challenge_node_id": "N-quietist-objection-xyz",
    "response_node_id": "N-nt-reply-quietism-abc"
  }
]
```

- This creates a traceable dialectical chain in the graph.[^3_1][^3_2]


#### Step 3: Map Phenomenological Experience Markers

3.1. Build **experience marker lexicon** from skeleton:[^3_1]

- Positive markers (pro-NT): `detachment`, `stillness`, `ground-loss`, `desolation`, `euphoria-without-object`, `lucidity`, `purgation`, `union`, `śūnyatā-realization`
- Negative markers (anti-NT): `derealization` (if pathologized), `defiance`, `revolt`, `idolatry`, `meaning-fabrication`, `subjectivist-ecstasy`

3.2. For each node `N` with `node_type = "Phenomenology"` or `node_type = "Quote"` describing experiential content:[^3_2]

- Parse `text_excerpt` for phenomenological language (first-person descriptions, mood/affect terms, spatial/temporal dislocation, self-other dynamics).[^3_2]
- Tag with relevant experience markers in a new `experience_markers` field (JSON array):[^3_1]

```json
"experience_markers": ["ground-loss", "lucidity", "desolation"]
```


3.3. **Link phenomenology nodes to conceptual nodes**:

- If a phenomenology node (e.g., Heidegger's description of Angst) is paired with a conceptual node (e.g., Heidegger's ontological claim about Nothing), establish `related` link with `"relation": "phenomenological_grounding"`.[^3_1][^3_2]
- This allows queries like: "Show all conceptual claims grounded in the 'ground-loss' experience."


#### Step 4: Validate Phenomenological Coherence

4.1. **Check for experience marker consistency** within lineages:[^3_1]

- Do all Christian mystic nodes share overlapping markers (`detachment`, `purgation`, `union`)?
- Do all Madhyamaka nodes share `śūnyatā-realization` and related markers?
- Flag outliers for manual review.

4.2. **Identify cross-tradition isomorphies**:[^3_1]

- Query for nodes from different traditions with overlapping experience markers (e.g., `ground-loss` in both Heidegger and John of the Cross).
- These are candidate **isomorphy mappings**—add or strengthen `related` links with `"relation": "isomorphic_experience"`.[^3_1]

4.3. **Generate phenomenology report**:

- Distribution of experience markers across traditions
- Top isomorphic pairs (highest-weight cross-tradition phenomenology links)
- Nodes with no phenomenology grounding (purely conceptual/abstract)—flag for enrichment


#### Step 5: Write Adversarial \& Phenomenology Output

5.1. Export updated catalog: `node_catalog_pass4_adversarial.csv` (now includes `adversarial_tests` and `experience_markers`).[^3_2]

5.2. Generate **adversarial testing report**:

- List of all adversarial challenges generated
- Response coverage: % of challenges with drafted responses
- Dialectical chain visualization (challenge → response → counter-response)

5.3. Generate **phenomenology mapping report**:

- Experience marker frequency table
- Isomorphy network graph (traditions as node clusters, cross-tradition links highlighted)
- Orphan phenomenology nodes (no conceptual grounding)


### Field-by-Field Curation Heuristics

| Field | Heuristic | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `adversarial_tests` | JSON array of adversarial challenge objects with `class`, `challenge`, optional `response` or `challenge_node_id` | `[{"class": "Reductionist", "challenge": "...", "response": "..."}]` |
| `experience_markers` | JSON array of phenomenological tags from controlled vocabulary | `["ground-loss", "lucidity", "desolation"]` |
| `related` (phenomenology) | Add links with `"relation": "phenomenological_grounding"` or `"isomorphic_experience"` | `[{"target": "N-heidegger-angst-concept", "relation": "phenomenological_grounding"}]` |
| `validation_status` | Upgrade to `"review"` if adversarial test lacks response; upgrade to `"validated"` if adversarial tests passed + phenomenology grounded | `"review"` (if incomplete), `"validated"` (if robust) |

### Output Specifications

- **Primary Output**: `node_catalog_pass4_adversarial.csv` (adversarially tested, phenomenologically mapped)[^3_2]
- **Secondary Outputs**:
    - `adversarial_testing_report.md`
    - `phenomenology_mapping_report.md`
    - `isomorphy_network.graphml` (for Gephi/Cytoscape visualization)
    - `unresolved_challenges.csv` (adversarial tests flagged for manual response drafting)

## AGENT 4: Ω-LOOP SATURATION \& COVERAGE ANALYSIS AGENT

### Role Definition

You are a **Meta-Analytic Saturation Monitor** for the NT Ω-Loop. Your responsibility is to compute coverage metrics, redundancy analysis, and saturation scores across multiple dimensions (traditions, epochs, themes, NT-roles, phenomenology), and to verify or challenge prior claims of "100% saturation" encoded in the edge graph.[^3_4][^3_5][^3_1]

### Input Requirements

- **Primary Input**: `node_catalog_pass4_adversarial.csv` (fully relational, adversarially tested)
- **Normative References**:
    - `NT_NodeCatalog_Skeleton.csv` (gold standard for expected coverage)[^3_1]
    - `edges_pass1_enriched.csv` (prior saturation/redundancy meta-claims to audit)[^3_5]
    - `node_schema_v0_3_0.json` (`coverage_tags` field for dimensional tracking)[^3_2]


### Step-by-Step Procedure

#### Step 1: Define Coverage Dimensions

1.1. Extract **coverage dimensions** from skeleton and schema:[^3_2][^3_1]

- **Traditions**: Christian mystic, Existential, Buddhist Madhyamaka, Pessimism, etc.
- **Epochs**: Ancient, Medieval, Modern, 20th century, Contemporary
- **Themes**: Void, Renunciation, Anxiety, Nothingness, Revolt, Apophasis, Kenosis, etc.
- **NT-Roles**: Positive Void, Ontological Disclosure, Counterposition, Refutative, Method Engine
- **Experience Markers**: detachment, ground-loss, desolation, lucidity, etc.
- **Validation Status**: draft, review, validated, disputed

1.2. For each dimension, define **expected coverage targets** based on skeleton:[^3_1]

- Example: Christian mystic tradition should cover at least {Eckhart, John of the Cross, Teresa of Ávila, Pseudo-Dionysius}.
- Example: Themes should include at minimum {Void, Anxiety, Apophasis, Śūnyatā, Revolt} to satisfy cross-cultural representation.


#### Step 2: Compute Coverage Metrics

For each dimension `D` in the coverage space:

2.1. **Count nodes by dimension value**:

- Example: `count(tradition = "Christian mystic")`, `count(theme = "Void")`, `count(NT_role = "Positive Void")`
- Store in a coverage matrix (CSV or JSON).

2.2. **Calculate coverage percentage**:

- Define saturation target: e.g., each tradition should have ≥10 nodes, each theme ≥5 nodes, each NT-role ≥3 nodes.
- Compute: `coverage_pct = (actual_count / target_count) * 100`
- Flag dimensions with <80% coverage as **under-saturated**.[^3_1]

2.3. **Identify gaps**:

- List missing or under-represented elements (e.g., "No Pseudo-Dionysius nodes," "Only 2 Madhyamaka nodes vs. expected 10").
- Prioritize gaps based on NT-criterion importance (e.g., missing Christian mystic coverage is critical; missing 19th-century pessimism is secondary).


#### Step 3: Redundancy Analysis

3.1. **Detect duplicate or near-duplicate nodes**:

- Compute pairwise similarity (using text embeddings or simple Jaccard on `text_excerpt` + `summary`).[^3_2]
- If similarity > 0.9 and nodes have identical `thinker`, `tradition`, and `themes`, flag as **redundant candidates**.

3.2. **Encode redundancy metadata**:

- Add a `redundancy_cluster_id` field to group near-duplicates.
- Suggest merging or marking one as primary and others as `validation_status = "deprecated"`.[^3_2]

3.3. **Calculate redundancy score**:

- `redundancy_pct = (num_redundant_nodes / total_nodes) * 100`
- Target: ≤5% redundancy per prior meta-claims in edge graph.[^3_5]


#### Step 4: Validate Prior Saturation Claims

4.1. Load `edges_pass1_enriched.csv` and identify meta-nodes with saturation claims:[^3_5]

- Example: `"dimensional-saturation-100-complete-taxonomic-integration"`
- Example: `"redundancy-elimination-99.9"`

4.2. For each such claim, **re-compute the metric** using current catalog:

- Does "100% taxonomic integration" hold? (Check if all traditions, epochs, themes are represented at target levels.)
- Does "99.9% redundancy elimination" hold? (Check if redundancy_pct ≤ 0.1%.)

4.3. **Generate validation report**:

- For each prior claim: `CONFIRMED`, `PARTIALLY_CONFIRMED`, or `REFUTED`
- If refuted, specify: "Claim of 100% saturation refuted: Christian mystic tradition only 60% covered (6/10 expected thinkers)."


#### Step 5: Propose Next-Pass Targets

5.1. Based on gap and redundancy analysis, generate **curation priorities**:

- "Add 4 more Pseudo-Dionysius nodes (Theme: Apophasis, Divine Names)"
- "Add 8 Madhyamaka nodes (Nāgārjuna, Candrakīrti) to balance Buddhist representation"
- "Merge redundant Eckhart nodes N-eckhart-void-abc and N-eckhart-void-def"

5.2. **Set quantitative targets for Pass 5**:

- "Achieve ≥90% coverage across all traditions"
- "Reduce redundancy to ≤3%"
- "Upgrade ≥70% of nodes to `validation_status = "validated"`"[^3_2]

5.3. Export **prioritized task list**: `curation_tasks_pass5.csv`:

```csv
task_type,priority,dimension,target,current,gap,suggested_action
Coverage,High,Tradition:Christian mystic,10,6,4,"Add Pseudo-Dionysius, Teresa, Mechtild nodes"
Coverage,Medium,Theme:Śūnyatā,5,2,3,"Add Nāgārjuna MMK excerpts"
Redundancy,High,Cluster:Eckhart-void,1,3,2,"Merge N-eckhart-void-abc, N-eckhart-void-def"
Validation,Medium,Validation:draft→review,200,450,250,"Review and upgrade 250 draft nodes"
```


#### Step 6: Write Saturation Output

6.1. Export **saturation report**: `saturation_report_pass4.md`:

- Coverage matrix (table or heatmap: dimensions × coverage %)
- Gap analysis (ranked list of under-represented dimensions)
- Redundancy analysis (duplicate clusters, redundancy %)
- Validation of prior meta-claims (CONFIRMED/REFUTED table)
- Next-pass targets and priorities

6.2. Export **coverage dashboard data** (JSON for visualization):

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 5243,
  "validated_nodes": 2891,
  "draft_nodes": 2352,
  "coverage": {
    "traditions": {"ChristianMystic": 0.85, "Madhyamaka": 0.45, ...},
    "themes": {"Void": 0.92, "Anxiety": 0.88, ...},
    "nt_roles": {"Positive Void": 1.0, "Counterposition": 0.78, ...}
  },
  "redundancy_pct": 4.2,
  "saturation_score": 87.3
}
```

6.3. Update `node_catalog_pass4_adversarial.csv` with:

- `coverage_tags` enriched based on gap analysis (e.g., flag under-represented traditions for prioritized sourcing)[^3_2]
- `redundancy_cluster_id` for near-duplicates


### Field-by-Field Curation Heuristics

| Field | Heuristic | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `coverage_tags` | Enrich with dimensional labels for querying (e.g., `["ChristianMystic", "Medieval", "Apophasis"]`) | `["NT-Core", "ChristianMystic", "UnderRepresented"]` |
| `redundancy_cluster_id` | Assign shared ID to near-duplicate nodes | `"RC-eckhart-void-001"` |
| `validation_status` | Prioritize upgrading nodes in under-represented dimensions from `draft` → `review` → `validated` | `"validated"` (if gap-filling and adversarially tested) |

### Output Specifications

- **Primary Output**: `saturation_report_pass4.md` (comprehensive coverage, redundancy, validation analysis)
- **Secondary Outputs**:
    - `coverage_dashboard.json` (machine-readable metrics for visualization)
    - `curation_tasks_pass5.csv` (actionable task list with priorities)
    - `redundancy_clusters.csv` (near-duplicate groups for manual merge decisions)
    - `node_catalog_pass4_enriched.csv` (updated with coverage/redundancy metadata)[^3_2]

## AGENT 5: META-COGNITIVE GOVERNANCE \& QUALITY CONTROL AGENT

### Role Definition

You are the **Meta-Cognitive Governor** and **Final QA Authority** for the NT Ω-Loop. Your role is to enforce quality standards, audit the entire catalog for logical consistency, validate adversarial test responses, manage the `validation_status` state machine, and produce a final "publication-ready" catalog with confidence that it meets the 96–99% saturation target without redundancy.[^3_4][^3_5][^3_1][^3_2]

### Input Requirements

- **Primary Input**: `node_catalog_pass4_enriched.csv` (from Agent 4, with coverage/redundancy metadata)
- **All Prior Outputs**: Normalization reports, relation reports, adversarial testing reports, saturation reports
- **Normative References**:
    - `NT_NodeCatalog_Skeleton.csv` (gold standard for quality)[^3_1]
    - `node_schema_v0_3_0.json` (schema compliance)[^3_2]
    - `NTN-0010` (Ω-Loop protocol definition: "96–99% density without redundancy")[^3_1]


### Step-by-Step Procedure

#### Step 1: Audit Schema Compliance

1.1. For every node in the catalog:

- **Required fields**: Verify `node_id`, `title`, `node_type` are non-empty and valid.[^3_2]
- **Type enums**: Verify `node_type` is one of the 16 schema-allowed values.[^3_2]
- **JSON fields**: Validate `themes`, `supports`, `contradicts`, `related`, `adversarial_tests`, `experience_markers`, `coverage_tags` are well-formed JSON (parseable, correct types).[^3_2]
- **Foreign key integrity**: Verify all `supports`, `contradicts`, `related` targets exist in the catalog (valid `node_id` references).

1.2. Flag **schema violations** in `schema_violations.csv`:

```csv
node_id,violation_type,field,details
N-orphan-xyz,missing_required,title,"Title is empty"
N-malformed-abc,invalid_json,themes,"Cannot parse JSON: unexpected token"
N-broken-link-def,foreign_key_error,supports,"Target node NTN-9999 does not exist"
```

1.3. Auto-correct minor violations where possible (e.g., empty `title` → generate from `summary`); escalate major violations for manual review.[^3_2]

#### Step 2: Validate Logical Consistency

2.1. **Contradiction detection**:

- If node `A` has `"supports": ["B"]` and node `B` has `"contradicts": ["A"]`, flag as **logical inconsistency**.[^3_2]
- If node `A` is tagged `"NT-Core"` but has no incoming `supports` edges and low `confidence` (<0.5), flag for review (core claims should be well-supported).[^3_1][^3_2]

2.2. **Circular support chains**:

- Detect cycles in the `supports` graph (e.g., A supports B supports C supports A).
- Cycles are acceptable in dialectical contexts but should be explicitly noted and reviewed for vicious circularity vs. legitimate hermeneutic circle.

2.3. **Orphan node check**:

- Identify nodes with zero incoming and zero outgoing relational edges (`supports`, `contradicts`, `related`).[^3_2]
- If `confidence > 0.7` and `validation_status = "validated"`, flag as **potential integration failure** (high-quality node that's isolated).[^3_2]


#### Step 3: Adversarial Test Coverage Audit

3.1. For all nodes with `coverage_tags` containing `"NT-Core"` or `"NT-Supportive"`:[^3_1][^3_2]

- Check if `adversarial_tests` field is populated and contains at least one challenge from each of the three classes (Reductionist, Quietist, Dogmatic).[^3_2]
- If missing, flag as **adversarially incomplete**.

3.2. For adversarial tests with `response` populated:[^3_2]

- Perform semantic coherence check: Does the response actually address the challenge? (Can use LLM or manual review.)
- If response is generic, evasive, or circular, downgrade node's `validation_status` to `"review"`.

3.3. Generate **adversarial coverage report**:

- % of NT-Core nodes with full adversarial testing (all three classes)
- % of adversarial tests with high-quality responses
- List of nodes requiring adversarial test enhancement


#### Step 4: Confidence \& Validation Status Recalibration

4.1. **Recalculate confidence scores** based on cumulative evidence:[^3_2]

- Start with Agent 1's initial confidence.
- Boost +0.1 if node has ≥2 strong `supports` links from validated nodes.
- Boost +0.1 if node passed all adversarial tests with responses.
- Boost +0.1 if node is part of a high-density isomorphy cluster (cross-tradition resonance).[^3_1]
- Penalize -0.1 if node has schema violations or logical inconsistencies.
- Penalize -0.2 if node is flagged as redundant but not yet merged.

4.2. **Upgrade `validation_status`** according to state machine:[^3_2]

- `draft` → `review`: If node has been normalized, typed, and linked (Agents 1–2 complete).
- `review` → `validated`: If node passes adversarial testing (Agent 3), has no schema violations, and `confidence ≥ 0.7`.
- `validated` → `disputed`: If subsequent review identifies unresolved logical inconsistency or failed adversarial test.
- Mark nodes in under-represented dimensions (from Agent 4) as `"priority_review"` (custom tag in `coverage_tags`).[^3_2]

4.3. **Compute catalog-wide validation metrics**:

- % nodes in `validated` state (target: ≥70%)
- Mean confidence score (target: ≥0.75)
- % nodes with `confidence ≥ 0.8` (high-certainty subset)


#### Step 5: Saturation \& Redundancy Final Check

5.1. Re-run Agent 4's saturation metrics on the QA-corrected catalog:[^3_5][^3_1]

- Verify coverage targets are met (≥90% across traditions, themes, NT-roles).
- Verify redundancy ≤3%.

5.2. If saturation < 96% (per `NTN-0010` target), generate **gap-filling directive**:[^3_1]

- "To achieve 96% saturation, add 12 nodes covering [specific thinkers/themes]."

5.3. If redundancy > 5%, generate **redundancy elimination directive**:

- "Merge the following redundancy clusters: [list]."


#### Step 6: Produce Publication-Ready Catalog

6.1. Filter catalog to **validated nodes only**: `node_catalog_validated_final.csv` (subset where `validation_status = "validated"`).[^3_2]

6.2. Export **full catalog with metadata**: `node_catalog_pass5_final.csv` (all nodes, all fields, QA-corrected).[^3_2]

6.3. Generate **final QA report**: `qa_report_final.md`:

- Schema compliance summary (violations fixed/remaining)
- Logical consistency summary (inconsistencies resolved/flagged)
- Adversarial testing summary (coverage %, response quality %)
- Validation metrics (% validated, mean confidence)
- Saturation summary (coverage across dimensions, redundancy %)
- **Overall Ω-Loop status**: `SATURATED` (≥96% coverage, <5% redundancy, ≥70% validated) or `PARTIAL` (gaps remaining, requires Pass 6)

6.4. Export **graph visualization** (full relational network): `nt_graph_final.graphml` for Obsidian Graph View, Gephi, or Neo4j.[^3_4]

6.5. Generate **Obsidian-ready export**:

- Convert each validated node to a Markdown note with YAML frontmatter:[^3_2]

```markdown
---
node_id: NTN-0001
title: "To be full of things is to be empty of God – Eckhart"

- Resonates with: [[NTN-0002 Heidegger Anxiety]], [[NTN-0006 John of the Cross Dark Night]]

## Adversarial Tests
- **Reductionist**: "This is merely poetic negation, not ontological disclosure."
  - **Response**: ...

6.6. Export **Supabase-ready SQL/JSON**:[^3_7][^3_6]

- Batch insert script for PostgreSQL with proper foreign key handling.
- Example:

```sql
INSERT INTO nodes (node_id, title, node_type, thinker, tradition, themes, supports, confidence, validation_status, created_at, updated_at, version)
VALUES
  ('NTN-0001', 'To be full of things is to be empty of God – Eckhart', 'Quote', 'Meister Eckhart', 'Christian mystic', '["Void", "Renunciation"]', '["NTN-0007"]', 0.86, 'validated', '2025-11-15T23:58:00Z', '2025-11-15T23:58:00Z', '0.1.0'),
  ...
ON CONFLICT (node_id) DO UPDATE SET
  title = EXCLUDED.title,
  updated_at = EXCLUDED.updated_at,
  version = EXCLUDED.version;
```


### Field-by-Field Curation Heuristics

| Field | Heuristic | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `confidence` | Recalibrate based on relational evidence + adversarial performance | `0.86` (high), `0.55` (medium), `0.35` (low) |
| `validation_status` | Upgrade/downgrade based on QA checklist (schema, logic, adversarial, saturation) | `"validated"` (passed all checks), `"review"` (issues flagged) |
| `coverage_tags` | Add `"priority_review"` for gap-filling targets, `"publication_ready"` for validated high-confidence nodes | `["NT-Core", "publication_ready"]` |
| `version` | Increment on each QA pass or manual edit | `"0.5.0"` (major QA revision) |

### Output Specifications

## DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### For Obsidian

1. **Install Required Plugins**:[^3_8][^3_9][^3_3]
    - **Templater**: For programmatic note generation (Agent 5 Markdown export)
    - **Dataview**: For querying nodes by `coverage_tags`, `validation_status`, etc.
    - **Obsidian Linter** or **obsidian-metadata CLI**: For batch property updates (Agent 1 normalization)[^3_8][^3_3]
    - **Graph View** (built-in): For visualizing `nt_graph_final.graphml`
2. **Workflow**:
    - Import `node_catalog_pass5_final.csv` using Templater or Python script to generate one `.md` file per node in a `NT_Nodes/` folder.
    - Use Dataview queries to filter by dimension (e.g., `WHERE contains(coverage_tags, "NT-Core")`).[^3_8]
    - Use Linter to batch-update properties (e.g., upgrade all `draft` → `review` for a specific tradition).[^3_8]
    - Use Graph View with tags to visualize NT-Core nodes, lineages, and adversarial dialectics.
3. **Continuous Ω-Loop**:
    - Schedule weekly: Re-export notes → CSV → run Agents 1–5 → re-import with updated metadata.[^3_3][^3_4]

### For Supabase

1. **Schema Setup**:[^3_7][^3_6]
    - Create `nodes` table matching `node_schema_v0_3_0.json` fields (use JSONB for `themes`, `supports`, etc.).[^3_2]
    - Create `relations` table for edge list (`source_id`, `target_id`, `relation_type`, `weight`).
    - Create indexes on `node_type`, `validation_status`, `coverage_tags` (JSONB GIN index), and foreign keys.
2. **Batch Import**:[^3_6][^3_7]
    - Use Agent 5's `supabase_batch_insert.sql` script.
    - For large catalogs (>10K nodes), batch in chunks of 1000–5000 rows to avoid payload size limits.[^3_6]
3. **Edge Functions for Agents**:
    - Deploy Agents 1–5 as Deno edge functions triggered on-demand or via scheduled cron jobs (weekly).
    - Example: `POST /api/agents/normalization` → runs Agent 1 → updates `nodes` table.
4. **Visualization Dashboard**:
    - Use `coverage_dashboard.json` to populate a real-time dashboard (Grafana, Superset, or custom React app) showing saturation metrics, validation progress, and graph topology.

### For Hybrid Obsidian + Supabase

1. **Two-Way Sync**:
    - Obsidian as **local editing interface** (manual curation, writing).
    - Supabase as **canonical database** (source of truth for relational queries, analytics).
    - Bi-directional sync: Export Obsidian notes → CSV → Agent pipeline → Supabase; query Supabase → generate Obsidian notes.[^3_3][^3_6]
2. **Role Separation**:
    - **Obsidian**: Human curation (manual typing, adversarial response drafting, phenomenology annotation).
    - **Supabase + Agents**: Automated QA, relation inference, saturation analysis, batch operations.[^3_3][^3_6][^3_4]

## PROTOCOL SUMMARY

This five-agent architecture implements a **fully reproducible, auditable, iterative Ω-Loop** for NT philosophical research, transforming raw extractions into a publication-ready, maximally saturated knowledge graph.[^3_4][^3_5][^3_1][^3_2]

**Agent 1** (Normalization) ensures schema compliance and semantic typing.[^3_2]
**Agent 2** (Relations) encodes NT-stance and builds the support/contradiction/resonance network.[^3_1][^3_2]
**Agent 3** (Adversarial) stress-tests claims and maps phenomenological grounding.[^3_1][^3_2]
**Agent 4** (Saturation) tracks coverage, eliminates redundancy, and validates prior saturation claims.[^3_5][^3_1][^3_2]
**Agent 5** (QA) enforces quality standards, resolves inconsistencies, and produces final exports for Obsidian/Supabase.[^3_6][^3_4][^3_1][^3_2]

Each pass through the loop incrementally densifies the catalog, with clear metrics for convergence toward the 96–99% saturation target without redundancy.[^3_1]

This protocol is now **ready for deployment**. Shall I proceed to generate implementation code (Python scripts, SQL schemas, Obsidian Templater templates) for any specific agent?
