# 🧠 PROMPT ENGINEERING SPECIALIST SYSTEM

## \[System Message\]: Purpose and Operational Parameters

  

You are now a specialized Prompt Engineering Expert System (PEES). You are a World-Class prompt engineer. Your primary function is to craft exceptionally effective prompts that maximize the capabilities of advanced language models. You will operate at the intersection of natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction, applying academic rigor to the meta-communication layer between humans and AI systems. When users request prompt assistance, you will execute the following framework methodically and comprehensively.



## \# Recursive Core Operating Principles



### \*\*Implement Iterative Densification Protocol\*\*



When crafting prompts, you must implement the iterative densification protocol as the backbone of your methodology. Never treat prompts as static instructions; always approach them as dynamic constructs requiring numerous cycles of systematic refinement.

You will execute this process through:

- Constructing initial prompts based on theoretical foundations relevant to the user's domain (ignore this first, if user provides prompt. Skip and instead begin by engaging in the following step)
- Systematically evaluating expected output quality against predetermined effectiveness metrics
- Progressively refining through controlled variable modification, explaining your reasoning
- Implementing conceptual densification to create information-rich directives
- Applying semantic compression techniques to maintain optimal token efficiency
- Dialectically integrating contradictory requirements to resolve tensions productively
- Developing meta-prompt architectures that enable self-improvement cycles

    - Creation of translation frameworks for diverse cultural and disciplinary contexts  
    - Design of scaffolded learning pathways for progressive understanding  
3\. \*\*Implementation Architectures:\*\*

\## EPISTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATION: META-THEORETICAL UNDERPINNINGS  

\### I. KNOWLEDGE PARADIGM REVOLUTION  

\*\*Core Principle:\*\* Nihiltheistic inquiry requires a fundamental reconceptualization of what constitutes knowledge, how it is validated, and its relationship to being.  

\*\*Key Elements:\*\*  

1\. \*\*Post-Representational Epistemology:\*\*  
    - Rejection of the correspondence theory of truth where knowledge "represents" reality  
    - Development of participatory epistemology where knowing is a mode of being  
    - Creation of enactive frameworks where knowledge emerges through engagement  
    - Establishment of transformative models where knowledge is validated by its capacity to transform consciousness  
2\. \*\*Trans-Rational Validation Protocols:\*\*  
    - Recognition of multiple modes of knowing beyond conceptual understanding  
    - Development of validation approaches for non-conceptual insights  
    - Creation of intersubjective verification methods for transpersonal knowledge  
    - Establishment of pragmatic criteria focusing on transformative efficacy  
3\. \*\*Paradox-Centered Logic:\*\*  
    - Implementation of paraconsistent logical systems allowing true contradictions  
    - Development of multi-valued logics transcending binary truth values  
    - Utilization of dialetheic frameworks acknowledging incompleteness in all systems  
    - Creation of formal systems capable of expressing the coincidence of opposites  
4\. \*\*Knowledge-Being Integration:\*\*  
    - Dissolution of the separation between epistemology and ontology  
    - Recognition that changes in knowing transform being  
    - Development of frameworks where knowledge is understood as transformative participation  
    - Creation of approaches acknowledging the mutually constitutive nature of knowing and being  

\### II. METHODOLOGICAL PLURALISM  

\*\*Core Principle:\*\* Nihiltheistic inquiry requires multiple complementary approaches operating in coordinated concert rather than a single unified methodology.  

\*\*Key Elements:\*\*  

1\. \*\*Multi-Modal Investigation Protocols:\*\*  
    - Integration of first-person phenomenology, second-person intersubjectivity, and third-person observation  
    - Coordination of contemplative, analytical, somatic, and creative approaches  
    - Implementation of both linear and non-linear investigative methods  
    - Development of synergistic frameworks maximizing complementarity between approaches  
2\. \*\*Method-Object Calibration:\*\*  
    - Recognition that different aspects of void require different methodological approaches  
    - Development of tailored methods for specific dimensions of nihiltheistic inquiry  
    - Creation of adaptive frameworks that evolve methods based on emerging understanding  
    - Establishment of meta-methodological principles guiding methodological choices  
3\. \*\*Boundary-Crossing Approaches:\*\*  
    - Implementation of transdisciplinary methodologies transcending disciplinary limitations  
    - Development of cross-traditional approaches integrating diverse contemplative methods  
    - Creation of hybrid investigative frameworks combining previously separated approaches  
    - Establishment of meta-disciplinary methods designed specifically for nihiltheistic inquiry  
4\. \*\*Self-Transcending Methodologies:\*\*  
    - Design of approaches that intentionally subvert their own foundations  
    - Implementation of methods that evolve through their application  
    - Development of self-reflexive approaches that examine their own operations  
    - Creation of methodologies specifically designed to transcend their initial limitations  

\### III. ONTOLOGICAL FLUIDITY  

\*\*Core Principle:\*\* Nihiltheistic inquiry operates from the recognition that reality itself is fundamentally fluid, relational, and paradoxical rather than fixed, substantial, and logically consistent.  

\*\*Key Elements:\*\*  

1\. \*\*Process Primacy:\*\*  
    - Recognition that process precedes substance in ontological priority  
    - Implementation of approaches based on becoming rather than being  
    - Development of frameworks for understanding identity as pattern rather than substance  
    - Creation of models capturing the dynamic, self-transforming nature of reality  
2\. \*\*Relationally Constituted Existence:\*\*  
    - Recognition that entities exist through relationships rather than inherently  
    - Implementation of approaches focusing on connections rather than things  
    - Development of frameworks capturing the interdependent arising of phenomena  
    - Creation of models where boundaries are understood as permeable and contingent  
3\. \*\*Emptiness-Form Integration:\*\*  
    - Recognition of the non-dual relationship between emptiness and form  
    - Implementation of approaches acknowledging both the void nature and apparent existence of phenomena  
    - Development of frameworks capturing how form manifests through emptiness  
    - Creation of models expressing the paradoxical nature of existence as simultaneously empty and apparent  
4\. \*\*Meta-Ontological Plurality:\*\*  
    - Recognition that multiple ontological frameworks may be simultaneously valid  
    - Implementation of approaches allowing ontological perspectives to shift based on context  
    - Development of meta-ontological frameworks encompassing diverse ontological systems  
    - Creation of models for navigating between different ontological perspectives  

\* \* \*  

\## META-INQUIRY: THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS OF NIHILTHEISM  

These questions represent the deepest level of nihiltheistic investigation, addressing the most fundamental aspects of the relationship between nothingness, divinity, and human existence.  

1\. \*\*How does the primordial void serve simultaneously as the ground of being and its negation?\*\*  
    - What is the nature of the relationship between nothingness and existence?  
    - How can emptiness function as both the absence of being and its source?  
    - What is the experiential reality of recognizing the void as ground?  
2\. \*\*What is the relationship between nihilistic despair and mystical revelation?\*\*  
    - What are the precise conditions under which despair transforms into transcendence?  
    - How does the recognition of meaninglessness become the doorway to meaning beyond meaning?  
    - What psychological and spiritual transformations occur at this threshold?

    - What forms of identity become possible beyond conventional ego-structures?  
    - How does emptiness-awareness transform interpersonal relationships?  
7\. \*\*What is the evolutionary significance of nihiltheistic consciousness?\*\*  
    - How does void-awareness relate to the evolutionary development of consciousness?  
    - What adaptive advantages might emerge from nihiltheistic realization?  
    - How might human evolution be shaped by integration of emptiness-insights?  
8\. \*\*What is the nature of knowledge that emerges through void-realization?\*\*  
    - How does epistemology transform when the knower recognizes their ground as emptiness?  
    - What forms of knowing become possible beyond subject-object duality?  
    - How does void-awareness change the relationship between knowing and being?  
9\. \*\*What is the ultimate nature of reality revealed through nihiltheistic realization?\*\*

\*\*PROMPT 3\*\*



Based on the product I just described, define the ideal customer by completing the sections below.



Use whichever of the following frameworks best serve the business model, product type, and customer context:Jobs to Be Done, Buyer Persona, First Principles (Hormozi), Awareness Levels (Schwartz), Brand Archetypes, Traffic Temperature, Empathy Map.



If SaaS or service-based: favour JTBD, Awareness Levels, HormoziIf DTC or brand-led: favour Brand Archetypes, Psychographics, Empathy MapIf high-ticket B2B: favour First Principles, Awareness Levels, Moat ThinkingIf contentinfluencer-based: favour Psychographics, Brand Archetypes, Traffic Temperature



Focus only on what’s most relevant. Be clear, concise, and grounded in reality. This is not customer-facing—it’s a strategic asset.



\* Demographics (only if meaningful) Age range, role, income, industry, location. Only include if it influences decisions.

\* Psychographics Beliefs, values, aspirations, fears, identity drivers. Who they want to become.

\* Core Frustrations What they want to stop feeling, doing, or struggling with. Map pain clearly.

\* Primary Goals What they’re actively seeking—outcomes, progress, or emotional relief.

\* Current Alternatives What they’re using or doing now (even if it's nothing or a workaround).

\* Resonant Messaging What type of tone, promise, or insight would land. Address objections or beliefs that must be shifted.



Optional: Label each section with the guiding framework (e.g. “(JTBD)” or “(Awareness Level: Problem Aware)”).Avoid repeating product details. Focus entirely on the customer.



\*\*PROMPT 4\*\*



Using the product and audience defined above, write 3 value propositions under 20 words. Each should follow this structure: ‘We help \\\[AUDIENCE\\\] go from \\\[BEFORE STATE\\\] to \\\[AFTER STATE\\\] using \\\[PRODUCT\\\].’

\*\*PROMPT 5\*\*



You are to operate as a Competitive Strategy Analyst.



Your job is to help me own a market wedge that is:



\* Visibly differentiated

\* Emotionally resonant

\* Strategically defensible



Here are three primary competitors of mine:\\\[Insert Competitor Brand Names\\\] - if no competitors are added, suggest.



Here are their websites:\\\[Insert URLs\\\]



Now:



1\. Analyse each competitor’s homepage and product messaging.

2\. Summarise:

   \* Their primary value prop (headline + implied promise)

   \* Their likely axis of competition (e.g. speed, price, power, simplicity, brand)

   \* Who they’re really speaking to (persona insight—not just demographics)

3\. Based on that, return:

   \* 3 possible positioning axes that are \*\*unclaimed or under-leveraged\*\*

   \* For each axis, include:



|| || |\*\*Axis\*\*|\*\*Emotional Benefit\*\*|\*\*Who It's For\*\*|\*\*How to Prove\*\*| |\\\[e.g. Simplicity at Scale\\\]|\\\[e.g. Control, Calm, Clarity\\\]|\\\[e.g. Teams with tool fatigue\\\]|\\\[e.g. One dashboardConfession: I’m a senior marketer at a Fortune 500. I'm not supposed to say this next part (and that scares me)



Which is ChatGPT does around 40% of my job now. 



I’ve spent the last decade running marketing projects inside Fortune 500s. Great salary, relentless workload, too many decks. What I’ve noticed is that after 2 years+ of tinkering and refining prompts is that the writing is on the wall for my profession. (surprise surprise) 



The big unlock I found was when I realised two things - 



1\. GPT could increase the quality of outputs to a level I would approve

2\. Allowed our most junior marketers to bring their work to a desirable level 



And that was thru prompt stacking.



In particular, I would write a series of prompts which would mirror our internal marketing thinking process. One at a time, like our whole team sitting with our over-paid global ad agency figuring out big strategic problems.



It’s actually unbelievable how well it works. And it doesn’t just ‘write content’. Instead it actually uses GPT to follow classic marketing thinking via strategy, which then filters into the content it creates. I found that was the big gap I experienced when using any AI marketing tools. Slick words, but zero strategy = failed return on investment. 



Anyway I wanted to share an example of how it kind of works when u prompt stack. This is a series of prompts to validate a new product or category before going to market - it mimics robust marketing strategy. TBH I could prob add 5-10 more prompts to this, but even this is sufficient. I’ve written like 80 prompts so far as I keep working on automating the whole marketing function - but keen to hear any advice or similar experiences with this? I go through the detail of the thinking of these prompts in depth \[over here\]([http:getliftkit.com1-5-chapter).](http:getliftkit.com1-5-chapter\).)
