## VERTEX-TO-VERTEX DIALECTICAL COUPLINGS

### Edge Relationships from J314 Analysis:

**M↔E (Meaning-Ethics)**: 

- Conflict: Craig vs Shestov (0.75 distance) - Rational vs absurd approaches to meaning and morality

- Apophatic traditions: Eckhart, John of Cross, Pseudo-Dionysius 
- Language breakdown under meaninglessness pressure (Cioran's aphoristic style)

**M↔D (Meaning-Despair)**:

- Kierkegaardian pathway: Meaning-collapse → despair → authentic transcendence
- Molinos: "Nihilistic experience" as necessary spiritual trial

**M↔N (Meaning-Negation)**:

- Heisman's technological nihilism vs Cioran's continued existence

**E↔L (Ethics-Language)**:
