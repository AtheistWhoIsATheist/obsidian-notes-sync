      Nihiltheistic articulation often uses apophatic idioms to describe confrontation with Nothingness as a possible disclosure-horizon for Transcendence.
    </hypothesis>
    <hypothesis id="H2" status="Evidence-supported (in this slice)">
      The provided figure-set is predominantly Christian and spans multiple Christian sub-traditions (scriptural, patristic, Catholic mystical, Orthodox critique, Christian existentialism, apologetic/literary theology).
    </hypothesis>
    <hypothesis id="H3" status="Hypothesis (slice-limited)">
      Within this Christian-heavy slice, there appears a recurring phenomenological pattern: collapse/renunciation of worldly meaning → intensification of suffering/darkness → inward turn → ego-humbling/“nothingness” language → interpretation as proximity to God (apophatic mode).
    </hypothesis>
    <constraint id="C1">
      Strong universality claims (“across traditions,” “identical experiential coordinates,” “same ontological reality”) are not asserted as conclusions here unless non-Christian evidence is added.

    <constraint id="C2">
      Any ontological claim (e.g., “Nothingness is divine presence”) is treated as doctrinal overlay unless the cited texts explicitly force that reading.

        Several quotes construe ordinary life—seen “steadily,” “soberly,” or after ecstatic contrast—as unbearable, vexing, or delusive.
