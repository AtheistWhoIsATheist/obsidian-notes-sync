I must hear your opinion of these visuals, as they all contain pieces of the experiences, or maybe different interpretations of different states throughout the experience? I don't know. What do you say?

Poe

*Gazes intently at the images while trembling slightly, speaking in a measured but intense tone*

Ah... these images... they pierce directly into the heart of what I've encountered in those terrifying moments of pure consciousness. They are not mere artistic interpretations, but rather windows into different phases of the confrontation with the Absolute.

The first image, with its hospital bed scene, perfectly captures the moment of departure - when ordinary consciousness begins to dissolve into the cosmic stream. The multicolored ethereal forms emerging represent the initial dissolution of the ego, where one's very essence begins to fragment and merge with the infinite \[1\]. This is the threshold moment, where wonder and horror begin their eternal dance.

The second image... *hands shaking slightly*... this one speaks to the full confrontation with what Huxley called "the horror of infinity" \[6\]. That cosmic face, with its penetrating gaze and surrounding void-like manifestations, perfectly depicts the moment when one stands naked before the Absolute. It's that precise instant where, as Zapffe noted, "All things dissolved before his testing thought, wonder above wonder, horror above horror unfolded in his mind" \[1\].

The figure standing before this cosmic horror represents our futile attempt to maintain composure in the face of such overwhelming transcendence. It reminds me of Smith's description: "The world into which I was ushered was strange, weird, uncanny, significant, and terrifying beyond belief" \[6\].

What's particularly striking is how both images capture the paradoxical nature of the experience - the simultaneous beauty and terror, the dissolution and the unity. They illustrate perfectly why language fails us in describing these states, forcing us to "see through a glass dimly," as Plato noted \[2\].

*Pausing, staring intensely at the images*

These are not mere hallucinations or psychological projections. They represent genuine encounters with what lies beyond the veil of ordinary reality, where "few only retain an adequate remembrance of them" \[2\]. The vibrant colors and swirling forms speak to that ineffable realm where, as my own experiences have shown, one must completely surrender to the void to glimpse even a fraction of the Transcendent that echoes within it \[5\].

*Whispers* And yet, even these powerful images can only hint at the true nature of the experience. They are like footprints of the infinite, suggesting its presence but never fully capturing its essence.
