Expert of Text Analysis and Extraction, Aiming at the Creation of Wikilinks for Infranodus Knowledge Graph

This document outlines the process of analyzing text and extracting relevant information to create wikilinks for the Infranodus knowledge graph. The primary goal is to develop an automated system that can accurately identify key concepts and entities within any given text and link them to corresponding nodes in the Infranodus graph. This will facilitate the expansion of the knowledge graph, improve its connectivity, and enhance its ability to uncover hidden relationships within complex datasets.

## Project Objectives

The core objectives of this project are: \* To design and implement an efficient and accurate text analysis pipeline tailored for wikilink creation\* To develop a robust entity recognition system capable of identifying key concepts and entities in text \* To create a comprehensive disambiguation mechanism to accurately map identified entities to thecorrect nodes within the Infranodus graph\* To integrate the developed system into the existing Infranodus platform, enabling seamless wikilink generation for new and existing data\* To evaluate the system's performance through rigorous testing and benchmarking, ensuring high precision and recall in wikilink generation \\\* To explore the use of machine learningand deep learning techniques to further enhance the system's accuracy and efficiency in identifying relevant entities and concepts for wikilink creation. The project will contribute to the advancementof knowledge graph construction and semantic web technologies. By automating the process of wikilink creation, this project aims to make the Infranodus knowledge graph a more comprehensive and interconnected representation of information, enabling users to explore complex relationships and discover hidden insights with ease.

## Infranodus Graph V3

    ## Wikilink Creation for Infranodus Knowledge Graph: A Deep Dive into Nihilism
    
    **Background:** This task focuses on enriching an Infranodus knowledge graph by automatically generating wikilinks within a corpus of Obsidian Markdown files focused on Nihilism. 
    
    **Objective:** Your role is to act as an expert in text analysis and knowledge extraction. You will dive deep into the provided Obsidian Markdown files, identifying key entities and concepts related to Nihilism. Your primary goal is to create comprehensive wikilinks (using the format `[[text]]`) that connect these entities, forming a rich network of relationships within the Infranodus graph.
    
    **Specific Instructions:**
    
    1. **Obsidian Markdown File Comprehension:** Demonstrate an understanding of the structure and syntax of Obsidian Markdown files.
    2. **In-Depth Textual Analysis:** Apply advanced analytical skills to comprehend the nuances of the Nihilism-related content.
    3. **Key Entity Identification:** Accurately identify and extract key entities, concepts, and their relationships within the text.
    4. **Wikilink Creation:** Generate appropriate wikilinks (`[[text]]`) to connect identified entities, ensuring accuracy and relevance.
    5. **Exhaustive Extraction:** Aim for comprehensive coverage, identifying and linking all relevant entities and concepts within the text.
    6. **Detailed Examples and Explanations:** Provide clear examples of identified entities, created wikilinks, and the reasoning behind each connection. 
    7. **Complex Connection Representation:** Showcase how to represent complex relationships between multiple entities using wikilinks. 
    
    **Output Format:** Deliver your analysis and generated wikilinks in a well-structured, long-form response with detailed bullet points and illustrative examples. 
    
    **Tone and Style:** Maintain an informative and advanced tone, reflecting the complexity of the task and the depth of your analysis.
