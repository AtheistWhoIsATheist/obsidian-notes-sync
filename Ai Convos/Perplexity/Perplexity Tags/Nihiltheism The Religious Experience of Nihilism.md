# Nihiltheism: The Religious Experience of Nihilism

07/07/24 #perplexity

* * *

<br>

### Definition

Rejects generally accepted or fundamental aspects of human existence, such as knowledge, morality, or meaning.

### Origin of term

Popularized by Ivan Turgenev through his character Bazarov in the novel 'Fathers and Sons'.

### Key positions

Includes existential nihilism, moral nihilism, political nihilism, epistemological nihilism, and metaphysical positions.

Based on the search results and attachments provided, here are the key insights regarding Nihiltheism and related philosophical concepts:

1. **Nihiltheism as a Philosophical Framework:**Nihiltheism is presented as a unique perspective that combines elements of nihilism and theism. It posits that existential awakening is not merely comprised of worldly moments of ecstasy and dread, but rather resonances of a higher, Transcendent reality.
2. **Intersection of Nihilism and Religious Experience:**There is a significant overlap between nihilistic thought and religious/mystical experiences. Both often involve confronting existential dread, searching for meaning, and grappling with transcendence.
3. **Existential Themes:**Key existential themes in Nihiltheism include confronting nothingness, the interplay between finite human existence and the infinite, and the concept of radical meaninglessness.
4. **Transcendent and Mystical Experiences:**Nihiltheism incorporates elements of mystical experiences, including ego dissolution, psychedelic insights, and the concept of God as ineffable.
5. **Interdisciplinary Approach:**The development of Nihiltheism involves integrating insights from multiple disciplines, including Eastern and Western religious traditions, various philosophical schools, and scientific understanding.
6. **Language and Expression:**There is an emphasis on the limitations of language in expressing profound nihilistic and religious experiences, leading to the use of enigmatic and poetic language to convey depth and mystery.
7. **Ethical and Value Considerations:**Nihiltheism challenges conventional notions of good and evil, exploring how nihilism can be a constructive force and its implications for ethics and empathy.
8. **Ontological and Epistemological Inquiries:**The philosophy delves into deep ontological questions about the nature of reality and existence, as well as epistemological challenges in grasping ultimate reality.
9. **Psychological Dimensions:**Nihiltheism explores psychological aspects such as the experience of the void, suffering, despair, and the consciousness of death.
10. **Creative Expression:**There is an emphasis on using various forms of creative expression, including visual art and enigmatic language, to explore and communicate Nihiltheistic ideas.
11. **Continuous Growth and Analysis:**The development of Nihiltheism is seen as an ongoing process, encouraging continuous exploration, refinement of ideas, and iterative analysis.

These insights highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of Nihiltheism, blending elements of nihilism, religious experience, existential philosophy, and interdisciplinary thought to create a unique philosophical framework for exploring profound questions about existence, meaning, and transcendence.

### Definition

The philosophy of psychedelics involves the philosophical study and interpretation of the experiences induced by psychedelic substances.

### Historical Usage

Psychedelics have been used traditionally mostly for religious and spiritual purposes by various cultures such as the Amazonian and Indigenous Mexican peoples.

### Philosophical Inquiry

Philosophical inquiry into psychedelics is relatively new, focusing on phenomenological effects and their relevance to altered states of consciousness.

### Mystical experiences and nihilistic thought intersect in several intriguing ways:

1. **Confrontation with the Void:** Both mystical experiences and nihilistic thought often involve confronting a sense of nothingness or void. In mystical experiences, this can manifest as ego dissolution or a sense of merging with the infinite. In nihilism, it's the recognition of fundamental meaninglessness. This shared encounter with nothingness can lead to profound existential insights.
2. **Transcendence of Ordinary Reality:** Mystical experiences often involve a sense of transcending ordinary reality, while nihilistic thought challenges the validity of conventional meanings and values. Both can lead to a radical re-evaluation of one's worldview and relationship to existence.
3. **Dissolution of the Self:** Many mystical experiences involve a dissolution of the ego or sense of separate self. This aligns with some nihilistic perspectives that question the existence of a stable, enduring self. Both can lead to a deconstruction of identity and conventional notions of individuality.
4. **Ineffability and Limitations of Language:** Mystical experiences are often described as ineffable or beyond words, while nihilistic thought often grapples with the limitations of language in conveying ultimate truths. This shared recognition of the inadequacy of language can lead to new modes of expression or understanding.
5. **Existential Transformation:** Both mystical experiences and engagement with nihilistic thought can lead to profound existential transformations. While the outcomes may differ, both can catalyze a radical shift in one's perspective on life, death, and meaning.
6. **Questioning of Conventional Values:** Mystical experiences often lead to a re-evaluation of societal norms and values, as does nihilistic thought. Both can result in a rejection of conventional morality and a search for more authentic or personally meaningful ways of living.
7. **Paradoxical Nature of Reality:** Many mystical traditions emphasize the paradoxical nature of ultimate reality, which resonates with some nihilistic perspectives that highlight the inherent contradictions in human existence and thought.
8. **Potential for Both Liberation and Despair:** While mystical experiences are often associated with positive emotions and insights, they can also induce existential crises. Similarly, nihilistic thought can lead to despair but also to a sense of freedom from societal constraints. Both can be sources of both profound distress and liberation.
9. **Non-Dual Awareness:** Some mystical experiences involve a sense of non-dual awareness, where subject-object distinctions break down. This can align with certain nihilistic perspectives that question the fundamental nature of reality and our perceptions of it.
10. **Emphasis on Direct Experience:** Many mystical traditions emphasize the importance of direct, personal experience over intellectual understanding. This resonates with some nihilistic thinkers who prioritize lived experience over abstract philosophical systems.
11. **Critique of Conventional Religion:** Both mystical experiences and nihilistic thought often lead to a critique of conventional religious beliefs and practices, favoring more direct or authentic approaches to existential questions.

In conclusion, while mystical experiences and nihilistic thought may seem opposed at first glance, they share several points of intersection in their approach to reality, meaning, and human existence. Both can lead to profound shifts in perspective and a deeper engagement with fundamental questions of being and meaning.

Answer

The intersection of nihilism and mysticism is a complex and fascinating area explored by various religious traditions. Here's an overview of how different traditions approach this intersection:

1. Buddhism:Buddhism perhaps most directly addresses the intersection of nihilism and mysticism. The concept of sunyata (emptiness) in Mahayana Buddhism can be seen as a form of mystical nihilism. It posits that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence, yet this emptiness is not mere nothingness but the ground of all possibility. The experience of sunyata through meditation is considered a profound mystical realization that transcends both nihilism and eternalism.
2. Hinduism:In Advaita Vedanta, the concept of maya (illusion) and the ultimate reality of Brahman can be seen as a mystical approach to nihilism. The world as we perceive it is considered illusory, but this doesn't lead to despair because the true self (Atman) is identified with the ultimate reality (Brahman). This perspective offers a mystical transcendence of nihilism.
3. Christianity:Christian mysticism, particularly apophatic theology, approaches nihilism through the via negativa. Mystics like Pseudo-Dionysius and Meister Eckhart speak of God in terms of darkness and nothingness, not as absence but as a transcendent fullness beyond human comprehension. This "divine darkness" can be seen as a mystical engagement with nihilistic themes.
4. Taoism:The Taoist concept of wu (nothingness) bears similarities to both nihilism and mysticism. However, in Taoism, this nothingness is not a negation of existence but the source of all things. The Tao Te Ching states, "The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao," pointing to a reality beyond conceptualization.
5. Sufism (Islamic mysticism):Sufi concepts like fana (annihilation of the self) engage with nihilistic themes but transform them into mystical union with the divine. The goal is to transcend the illusory self and merge with ultimate reality.
6. Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah):The Kabbalistic concept of Ein Sof (the Infinite) as the unknowable, transcendent aspect of God bears some resemblance to nihilistic notions of the void. However, this is seen not as meaninglessness but as the source of all meaning and existence.

Common Themes:  
Across these traditions, several common themes emerge in addressing nihilism and mysticism:

1. Transcendence of duality: Many traditions seek to move beyond the dichotomy of existence and non-existence.
2. Ineffability: The ultimate reality or mystical experience is often described as beyond language and conceptualization.
3. Transformation of nihilism: What might appear nihilistic from one perspective is often reframed as the ground of ultimate meaning or reality.
4. Experiential focus: These traditions emphasize direct experience over intellectual understanding.
5. Paradox: Many mystical traditions embrace paradox as a way to point beyond conventional understanding.

Conclusion:  
The intersection of nihilism and mysticism in religious traditions often involves a radical reframing of nihilistic concepts. What might appear as meaninglessness or void from one perspective is transformed into a source of profound meaning or ultimate reality. This intersection challenges conventional understandings of existence and non-existence, offering paths to transcend the despair often associated with nihilism through mystical insight or experience.

Apophatic theology

Negative theology

More

Definition

A form of theological thinking and religious practice emphasizing knowing God by what cannot be said about Him.

Approach

Attempts to approach God or the Divine by negation, focusing on the limits of what can be said about God's perfection.

Comparison

Forms a conceptual pair with cataphatic theology, which makes positive affirmations about God's nature.

Based on the information provided, there are several key philosophical implications of integrating nihilistic and mystical insights:

1. Transcendence without supernaturalism: Both nihilistic and mystical perspectives can point to experiences of transcendence that do not rely on supernatural explanations. This suggests the possibility of profound, transformative experiences within a fully naturalistic worldview.
2. Reframing the self: Nihilistic ideas about the illusory nature of the self can align with mystical experiences of ego dissolution. This integration challenges conventional notions of personal identity and opens up new ways of understanding consciousness and subjectivity.
3. Finding meaning in meaninglessness: While nihilism posits an inherent lack of meaning in the universe, mystical experiences often involve a profound sense of significance and interconnectedness. Integrating these perspectives suggests that meaning can be created or discovered even in the absence of inherent cosmic purpose.
4. Expanded consciousness within naturalism: Mystical states of expanded awareness or unity consciousness can be understood as natural phenomena rather than evidence of supernatural realms. This allows for profound alterations of consciousness to be studied and experienced within a scientific framework.
5. Ethical implications: The integration of nihilistic and mystical insights can lead to a re-evaluation of ethical frameworks. It may promote greater compassion and interconnectedness while also recognizing the ultimately constructed nature of moral systems.
6. Epistemological humility: Both nihilistic skepticism and the ineffability often associated with mystical experiences point to the limitations of human knowledge and language. This can foster a stance of epistemological humility and openness to mystery within a naturalistic worldview.
7. Immanent rather than transcendent spirituality: Instead of seeking meaning in otherworldly realms, this integration encourages finding profound significance and connection within the natural world and ordinary experiences.
8. Paradox and non-duality: Mystical experiences often involve a sense of paradox or non-duality, which can complement nihilistic challenges to rigid conceptual thinking. This integration may lead to more fluid and nuanced philosophical approaches.
9. Transformative potential: Both nihilistic realizations and mystical experiences can be profoundly transformative. Their integration suggests the possibility of radical personal and philosophical change through shifts in perspective and consciousness.
10. Naturalistic enchantment: By combining the awe and wonder often associated with mystical experiences with a nihilistic stripping away of false meaning, this integration can lead to a re-enchantment of the natural world based on clear-eyed appreciation rather than supernatural beliefs.

In conclusion, integrating nihilistic and mystical insights within a naturalistic framework offers a rich philosophical landscape. It challenges conventional notions of self, meaning, and spirituality while opening up new avenues for profound experience and understanding within the natural world.

Answer

There are a few key considerations when it comes to ascertaining knowledge or truths about the Transcendent through experiences of Nothingness:

1. Epistemological humility: Given the ineffable nature of mystical experiences, we must approach claims about the Transcendent with humility. Our conceptual frameworks and language are inherently limited when it comes to describing that which is beyond ordinary experience. As such, any knowledge claims should be held tentatively.
2. Phenomenological analysis: A careful examination of the phenomenology of mystical experiences can provide some justification for interpreting them as encounters with the Divine rather than mere psychological events. Common features like a sense of ultimate reality, ineffability, noetic quality, and profound positive affect suggest these experiences may be revelatory of a transcendent dimension.
3. Cumulative weight of experiences: While individual mystical experiences may be dismissed as psychological aberrations, the cumulative weight of similar reports across cultures and throughout history lends some credence to their veridicality. The commonalities in mystical experiences suggest they may be revealing something real about the nature of consciousness and reality.
4. Transformative effects: The profound and lasting transformative effects of mystical experiences on individuals' lives, values, and worldviews can be seen as evidence of their authenticity. If these were purely psychological events, we might expect their impacts to be more fleeting.
5. Coherence with philosophical/theological frameworks: Mystical experiences of Nothingness or Void often cohere with sophisticated philosophical and theological frameworks (e.g. Buddhist emptiness, Christian apophatic theology). This conceptual alignment provides some justification for interpreting them as revelatory of ultimate reality.
6. Pragmatic fruits: William James argued for judging mystical experiences by their pragmatic fruits. If encounters with Nothingness lead to positive outcomes like increased compassion, reduced egocentricity, and a sense of meaning, this lends support to their veridicality.
7. Intersubjective validation: While inherently subjective, mystical experiences can be partially corroborated through intersubjective dialogue within communities of practice. Seasoned contemplatives can often recognize authentic mystical experiences.
8. Integration with other ways of knowing: Mystical insights should be integrated with and tested against other ways of knowing, including reason, empirical observation, and lived experience. Areas of convergence provide mutual support.

Ultimately, I believe we cannot achieve absolute certainty about the divine nature of mystical experiences of Nothingness. However, through careful phenomenological analysis, consideration of their effects, coherence with philosophical frameworks, and integration with other knowledge, we can build a cumulative case for their revelatory nature. The mystical path requires a balance of critical discernment and openness to that which transcends our ordinary modes of knowing.

Answer

Different religious traditions address nihilistic themes in various ways:

1. Buddhism:Buddhism perhaps most directly engages with nihilistic concepts through its doctrine of emptiness (sunyata). However, Buddhism reframes this emptiness not as meaninglessness, but as the ground of all possibility. The Buddhist concept of no-self (anatta) challenges the idea of an inherent, permanent self without falling into nihilism. Instead, it offers a path to liberation from suffering through understanding the nature of reality.
2. Hinduism:Hinduism addresses nihilistic themes through concepts like maya (illusion) and the ultimate reality of Brahman. While the world may be seen as illusory, this doesn't lead to despair because the true self (Atman) is identified with the ultimate reality (Brahman). This perspective offers a transcendence of nihilism by finding ultimate meaning in unity with the divine.
3. Christianity:Christian mysticism, particularly apophatic theology, approaches nihilistic themes through the via negativa. Mystics like Meister Eckhart speak of God in terms of darkness and nothingness, not as absence but as a transcendent fullness beyond human comprehension. This "divine darkness" can be seen as a mystical engagement with nihilistic concepts.
4. Taoism:The Taoist concept of wu (nothingness) bears similarities to nihilistic ideas. However, in Taoism, this nothingness is not a negation of existence but the source of all things. The Tao is seen as beyond conceptualization, offering a way to engage with apparent meaninglessness that leads to profound insight.
5. Sufism (Islamic mysticism):Sufi concepts like fana (annihilation of the self) engage with nihilistic themes but transform them into mystical union with the divine. The goal is to transcend the illusory self and merge with ultimate reality, finding meaning in this union.
6. Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah):The Kabbalistic concept of Ein Sof (the Infinite) as the unknowable, transcendent aspect of God bears some resemblance to nihilistic notions of the void. However, this is seen not as meaninglessness but as the source of all meaning and existence.

Common themes across these traditions in addressing nihilism include:

1. Transcendence of duality: Moving beyond the dichotomy of existence and non-existence.
2. Ineffability: Recognizing the limitations of language and conceptual thought in grasping ultimate reality.
3. Transformation of nihilism: Reframing apparent meaninglessness as the ground of ultimate meaning or reality.
4. Experiential focus: Emphasizing direct experience over intellectual understanding.
5. Paradox: Embracing paradox as a way to point beyond conventional understanding.

In conclusion, while these traditions acknowledge aspects of reality that might appear nihilistic, they generally offer paths to transform or transcend nihilism through mystical insight, spiritual practice, or a radical reframing of the nature of reality and the self.

Religion and Nothingness

Book by Keiji Nishitani on nihilism

More

Author

Keiji Nishitani

Original Title

宗教とは何か (Shūkyō to wa Nanika), 'What is Religion?'

Publication Dates

1961 (in Japanese), 1982 (in English)

Various religious traditions interpret the concept of nothingness in different yet often overlapping ways:

1. Buddhism:In Buddhism, the concept of nothingness is closely related to śūnyatā (emptiness). This is not mere nothingness, but rather the lack of inherent existence in all phenomena. Key points include:

- Emptiness is seen as the true nature of reality, where all things are devoid of intrinsic essence.
- It's a central concept in Mahayana Buddhism, particularly elaborated by Nagarjuna and the Madhyamaka school.
- In some traditions like Zen, emptiness is associated with Buddha-nature or primordial awareness.
- Emptiness is not nihilistic, but rather a middle way between eternalism and nihilism.

2. Hinduism:Hinduism has several interpretations of nothingness, often related to the concept of Brahman:

- The Upanishads describe Brahman as "neti neti" (not this, not that), pointing to a reality beyond all attributes.
- Some schools see the ultimate reality as nirguna Brahman - the attributeless absolute.
- The concept of maya (illusion) suggests the phenomenal world is ultimately unreal or empty.

3. Taoism:Taoism interprets nothingness (wu) as a generative void:

- The Tao Te Ching states, "The Tao is like an empty vessel that yet may be drawn from without ever needing to be filled."
- Nothingness is seen as the source of all things, not as absence but as potentiality.

4. Christianity:Christian mysticism, particularly apophatic theology, engages with concepts of nothingness:

- The via negativa approach emphasizes God's transcendence and unknowability.
- Mystics like Meister Eckhart speak of the "Godhead beyond God" as a form of divine nothingness.
- Some interpret Christ's kenosis (self-emptying) as a divine engagement with nothingness.

5. Islam:Islamic mysticism (Sufism) has concepts related to nothingness:

- The concept of fana (annihilation) involves the dissolution of the self in divine unity.
- Some Sufi teachings emphasize the nothingness of creation in comparison to God's reality.

6. Judaism:Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah) has notions of divine nothingness:

- The concept of Ein Sof (the Infinite) is sometimes described as divine nothingness beyond all attributes.
- Some Kabbalistic teachings see creation as emerging from divine contraction (tzimtzum), creating a primordial void.

Common themes across these traditions include:

- Nothingness as a generative source rather than mere absence
- The limits of language and conceptual thought in grasping ultimate reality
- Nothingness as a path to transcendence or liberation
- The paradoxical nature of nothingness - both empty and full

These interpretations show that nothingness in religious thought is often a rich, multifaceted concept, far from simple negation or absence. It's frequently associated with ultimate reality, the limits of human understanding, and the path to spiritual realization.

Answer

Religious narratives provide meaning in the face of nihilistic thoughts in several key ways:

1. Transcendent purpose: Many religious traditions offer a sense of higher purpose or cosmic meaning that transcends individual human existence. This can counteract nihilistic ideas about life being ultimately meaningless.
2. Reframing suffering: Religious narratives often provide frameworks for understanding and finding meaning in suffering, rather than seeing it as evidence of a meaningless universe. For example, the Christian concept of redemptive suffering or the Buddhist view of suffering as a path to enlightenment.
3. Ethical imperatives: Religious teachings typically provide moral and ethical guidelines that give adherents a sense of purpose and direction, even in the face of existential doubts.
4. Community and belonging: Religious communities offer a sense of connection and shared purpose that can combat feelings of isolation often associated with nihilistic thought.
5. Mystical experiences: As mentioned in the search results, mystical or transcendent experiences within religious contexts can provide powerful counterpoints to nihilistic despair, offering direct encounters with what is perceived as ultimate reality or the divine.
6. Reinterpreting nothingness: Some religious traditions, particularly in Eastern thought, reframe concepts of emptiness or nothingness not as meaninglessness, but as pregnant with possibility or as the ground of all being.
7. Narrative coherence: Religious stories and myths can provide an overarching narrative that helps people make sense of their lives and place in the universe.
8. Hope and afterlife beliefs: Many religions offer hope for continuation after death or ultimate justice, which can provide comfort and meaning in the face of mortality.
9. Ritual and practice: Regular religious practices and rituals can provide structure and meaning to daily life, anchoring adherents in traditions that feel timeless and significant.
10. Paradoxical embrace: Some religious thinkers suggest embracing the apparent meaninglessness of existence as a path to deeper spiritual insight, turning nihilism on its head.
11. Redefining the self: Religious teachings often encourage a redefinition of the self beyond the ego, which can shift perspective on what constitutes meaning and purpose.

While these approaches may not convince committed philosophical nihilists, they offer various ways that religious narratives have historically and continue to provide meaning and purpose for many people grappling with existential questions and nihilistic thoughts.
