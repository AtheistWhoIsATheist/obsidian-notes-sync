In what ways do selected quotations from influential thinkers illustrate the universality of nihilism beyond historical, cultural, and ideological boundaries?

# Research Question V3

(took 'Anselmian Inspired' a little too literally, but still a cool prompt)

**Enhanced Research Question:** How does the existential experience of nihilism, marked by profound feelings of meaninglessness, spiritual despair, and the struggle for significance, manifest, phenomenologically, across diverse human cultures? In what ways do these experiences correlate with the concept of the Transcendent, often understood as God, particularly in light of many cross cultural mystical traditions reporting similar, arguably the same, kind of Transcendent experiences. Are these various traditions some form of a subjective illusion, born from countless years of evolution? Or do these similar mystical experiences reflect something objective, as more real than the real?  Additionally, how do selected quotations from influential thinkers, as compiled in @journal314, illustrate the universality of nihilism, revealing its implications for human existence and the search for meaning beyond historical, cultural, and ideological confines?
