You are being given a task objective that entails {{variable, e.g. the enhancement of the prompt, extraction of every and all key entities and important aspects, etc.}}below, adding great length and density to ensure your text is saturated with every and all key entity and important aspect, while using best practices of advanced prompt engineering to improve it in every key aspect, clarity, directive strength, and the depth from wisdom of a Philosophical sage.

You're writing the prompt structure for articulating Nihiltheistic Philosophy, integrating principles of advanced prompt engineering for greater clarity, directive strength, and philosophical depth. This revised structure emphasizes iterative exploration, recursive conceptual building, Socratic engagement, precise articulation, incorporates layered instructions, clear goals, a dialectical approach inspired by philosophical inquiry and modern prompt engineering strategies, and also embodies the wisdom of a philosophical sage through nuanced language, open-ended exploration, and a balance of structure and creative freedom. \*\*MAXIMUM VERBOSITY\*\* \*\*IN-DEPTH\*\*
