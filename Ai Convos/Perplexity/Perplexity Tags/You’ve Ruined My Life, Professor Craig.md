# **You’ve Ruined My Life, Professor Craig**

Dear Professor Craig,

My name is Adam. I am an atheist, and have been one ever since I

can remember. I was brought up in the Roman Catholic church, but

could never really say that I held any theistic beliefs with any

sincerity. For instance, one time, when I was around eight or nine

years old, I asked a nun at my church where I "was" before I was

born. She responded: "You were with God." I was still curious, so I

asked her how long I was with God, before my being born, and she

proclaimed: "For an eternity!" I then asked her why I could not

remember "existing with God” for an eternity of time (is an eternity

of time even a coherent concept?). She had enough with that

question and proceeded to shew me away to play with the other

children. Looking back, I am proud of my skeptical disposition.

Let's skip ahead a little bit. I found philosophy and I fell in love with

it. I transferred schools in order to obtain my BA. Almost all of the

papers I wrote as an undergrad were about atheism or God. I was on

a mission to be as rational as I could with regards to my atheistic

beliefs. Moreover, I was practically an "evangelical" atheist,

proclaiming the good word of rationality! My beliefs were strident at

best, and intolerant at worst. I thought I had the "God question" all

figured out. It was a settled issue for me: God did not exist. The

philosophy of religion was my initial and main draw to philosophy,

but I soon found myself wanting to explore philosophy in all its

glory. Philosophy, as a whole, was too interesting to just "stop", then

move on to some "real job". I decided to apply to an MA program in

philosophy at CSULA, and got accepted. Philosophy was something

that I took very seriously. So much so, that I drove from NY to CA, with no job and no place to live in order to continue my studies. I actually wrote a response to your paper _The Absurdity of Life_

_Without God_ and used it as my writing sample in order to get in to

CSULA. I stayed up for months writing and polishing my responses

to your claims of the inconsistency of atheism in its response to

meaning, value, and purpose in life. I had too. You were telling me

my life, as a _direct_ result of my worldview, was worthless in every

possible way. Well, as an ambitious philosophy student, I could not

simply let you get away this. Your objections to atheism needed

answers. And after wrestling with your paper for some time, I

actually felt pretty good about the end product and presumed to have

"answered" your objections to atheism in a satisfactory way. I could

now move on, live my life with the excitement, consistency, and

appreciation that I had before reading your essay.

<br>

I was wrong.

<br>

I should have known better too, since the first time I read that paper

of yours, I couldn't sleep for two days. It completely shattered my

worldview. Let me mention here that I was a huge fan of the New

Atheists, but I always sensed something was askew with them.

Something seemed off about them because whenever they were

talking about meaning, value, or purpose, they answered in such

ways that only a person ignorant of the objections in your paper

could respond. In short (too late), your paper never left my mind,

even years after I wrote a "response" to it. I knew, deep down, that

not only did I not, but could not answer your objections to atheism.

What you say the atheistic worldview entails is true. There is no

escaping the nihilism as an atheist.

<br>

_Everything has died for me._

<br>

**_You have ruined my life._**

<br>

Before I go any further, let me say that you are and always have been

my favorite living philosopher. I have seen every debate you have

ever recorded and put up on the internet. I watch all your lectures

and talks (Closer to Truth, youtube, etc.) I think you are the epitome

of what a philosopher should be. You're uber logical, fantastically

clear, and "computeresk" with the speed and precision of your

responses to objections against your position, particularly the

criticisms you respond to in your debates. For a long time now, I

have wanted to be a philosopher as you are a philosopher. I want to

have an argument posed against my position, and be able to dissect it

in the same manner as you do. I can honestly say that I have learned

more from reading what you have wrote and watching you on the

internet than maybe all of my years in school, formally studying

philosophy. I seem to owe you a lot, with regards to my philosophical

development, at least.

<br>

Now, let's get down to business and why exactly it is that you have

ruined my life. After reading your paper on the absurdity of life

without God, I soon realized that I _had_ to become a nihilist. To act

otherwise would inevitably reduce into an inconsistency. Nihilism is

the logical conclusion of an atheistic worldview. Yet, nihilism is

unlivable. Christopher Hitchens used to say that you cannot derive

any knowledge of what an atheist believes from the fact that she is an

atheist. If someone claims to be an atheist, according to Hitchens,

you can only conclude that she believes that "God does not exist" or

that she "lacks a belief in God" (don't get me started with thatdistinction!!!) 

You cannot “go any further” and know if she is a

Marxist or a Capitalist, etc. But your paper shows that Hitchens is

patently false about this. Atheism necessarily entails nihilistic

conclusions about certain questions, particularly those you bring up

in your paper about meaning, value, and purpose.

There is a similar misunderstanding that shows how atheists fail to

fully comprehend the severity of their own worldview. I feel like I

need to say how disappointed I am in the New Atheists, and

moreover, the professional philosophers, who do not understand the

"moral argument" for God's existence. Why can't they comprehend

the ontology of values? Why is this so difficult? It is all too obvious

that you are not talking about whether people can act, or know of

the, "good" on atheism, but rather that there is no foundation for

morality outside of God. Sorry, I just had to rant a little, because it

bothers me when philosophers, who should know better, don't

comprehend the moral argument. I can only imagine how frustrated

you must feel. Further, I hate all the nasty comments you get on

YouTube. People don't even understand how well thought out your

views are. You have the most coherent worldview I have ever heard

anyone describe. Sorry, just wanted to say that you have at least one

atheist on your side, sir.

So, this brings me to the problem (finally, sorry)-

Philosophically, I agree with almost everything you say. Not in a

“follower” sense, but in that I find what you say either convincingly

true or I find I come to the same conclusions that you do with

regards to particular ideas that I have reasoned through on my own.

With that said, I am still an atheist. How is this possible? How could

my favorite philosopher be a Christian, I agree with almosteverything he says, yet I am an atheist? Well, it seems that you make

an extremely strong case for the rationality of an “abstract” notion of

God, but I cannot get myself to go the extra step further and believe

any of the world religions (not that I believe this abstract God

actually exists either, it just seems to be becoming more and more

plausible to me). I definitely cannot get myself to be a Christian.

Christianity just does not seem true to me. However, the deeper I

dive into philosophy, the more the theistic worldview seems more

plausible. The concepts or “language” of mathematics seems to “cry

out” as you put it for an explanation, objective moral values seem to

be real (but they can't be “real”, if atheism is true), the idea of

"existence" nauseates me to no end (just the thought of anything, at

all, existing, and especially existing without any reason, frightens

me,), and I could go on and on. You know, all the things you speak

about in your YouTube videos.

However, even when I don't think about the arguments, and I think

about what you and others have said about the “Holy Spirit”, I

cannot get myself to believe that this “Holy Spirit” exists and can

authenticate my belief in God. As you know, Martin Luther thought

the Holy Spirit would guide people in reading the Bible properly,

when the Reformation was underway, since there was the concern

that without the guidance of the church, people may interpret the

bible incorrectly. The Holy Spirit's guiding capabilities seem to be

have been proven empirically false though, due to such a wide variety

of conflicting beliefs all being derived from the Bible. Now I know

that the diversity of beliefs doesn't necessarily allow for the

conclusion that all of the religious beliefs or experiences are false,

that there aren't at least some beliefs or experiences that are true,

and therefore the Holy Spirit does not exist. However, this 

disagreement does cause pause in me, and it makes the situation

suspect enough to where I cannot seemingly distinguish between an

authentic experience with the Holy Spirit or my being deluded. There

does not seem to be anything here to help me out of the nihilistic rut.

Lately though, I have been questioning why I even value

“rationality”, or what it even means to “value” rationality on an

atheistic worldview. That's another topic though, sorry.

Let me wrap this ramble up. I am now stuck in a nihilistic-atheistic

world that I hate. Agnosticism is not even a coherent position to me,

with regards to a Perfect Being, since I believe that the greatest

conceivable being could give me knowledge of its existence, if it

wanted to. Theism is a dream come true. The world would make

sense, the existential mysteries that haunt me would be solved, life

would be livable. It is atheism, however, which seems to be true, yet I

do not want to live like this. I have become depressed to no end. I

have been in a nihilistic rut for years now. I have become utterly

recluse. Yet, even with all this, I cannot come to believe in God. What

would YOU suggest I do? This letter is as sincere as it gets. You may

be my last hope. Since I agree with you on so much, I was hoping you

would have the answer to this. I know the “answer” _is_ Christianity,

but as I said, I cannot get myself to believe its truth.

I am an atheist who hates atheism. I want there to be a God more

than anything, yet I cannot get myself to believe in one. I cannot

seem to give an adequate answer to Camus's question: “Is life worth

living?”

I feel like a philosopher of your caliber is the only person I have left

to turn to. A psychologist wouldn't get my concerns, at least I don't

think think they would. I need the clarity and reasonableness of aphilosopher. Please, help.

<br>

Your biggest atheist fan,

<br>

Adam

<br>

PS- Do me one favor? Even if you never have time to respond.

Please, do not debate Lawrence Krauss anymore. As with most

people not trained in philosophy, it is not even an argument in any

sort of philosophical sense. He is a shouting bag of hot air with

irrelevant criticisms and gross misunderstandings of the arguments.

He does not deserve to be the face for atheism, we both know this.

But maybe this is your plan.

# **DR. CRAIG’S RESPONSE**

Adam,it is so encouraging to get a letter like yours! You have seen through

the fog of often hateful rhetoric to discern the real issues. Your story

reminds me so much of C. S. Lewis, who, as a scientific naturalist,

found everything that he thought was real to be meaningless and

unfulfilling, and everything he loved, such as myth, legend, and

fantasy, to be imaginary and unreal. Like you, Lewis approached

Christ gradually, shedding first his naturalism and then later his

scepticism about Jesus of Nazareth. Lewis finally broke the bonds of

the naturalism that had bound him, discovering in Christ the “true

myth,” the fusion of rationality and imagination. Once you free

yourself of your atheism, you’ll find the next step to Christian theism

a relatively short one.

You mention your scepticism about Luther’s belief that the Holy

Spirit “_would guide people in reading the Bible properly_,” for “_The_

_Holy Spirit's guiding capabilities seem to be have been proven_

_empirically false. . . , due to such a wide variety of conflicting beliefs_

_all being derived from the Bible._” Now I don’t subscribe to the belief

you attribute to Luther; nevertheless, the argument you offer against

it does not strike me as a good one. In order to prevent a plethora of

divergent interpretations, what would be required is, not just that

Holy Spirit would guide people into the truth, but that Holy Spirit

would intervene to prevent aberrant interpretations of the Bible as

well, and Luther never claimed that He does that. If Luther is right,

one would expect to find people adhering to a correct interpretation

and others departing from the true way and propounding deviant

interpretations, which is exactly what we do find. Luther’s view

would be falsified only if everyone departed from the truth. \*FOOTNOTE

I think that what the Holy Spirit does is to furnish believers with afundamental assurance of their being properly related to God and

unbelievers a conviction of their not being properly related to God

but of being in need of His forgiveness and moral cleansing. While

this entails the truth of certain core Christian claims, it does not

guarantee proper interpretation of biblical passages. That is instead

achieved through the use of proper hermeneutical techniques of

literary interpretation.

I think you already discern the weakness of your objection, for you

say, “_I know that the diversity of beliefs doesn't necessarily allow_

_for the conclusion that all of the religious beliefs or experiences are_

_false, that there aren't at least some beliefs or experiences that are_

_true, and therefore the Holy Spirit does not exist._” Right; you need

to be open to the convicting witness of the Spirit in your life that you

need God’s forgiveness and cleansing for your moral failures. Anyone

who thinks hard about the moral argument should realize that if

objective moral values and duties do exist, he falls desperately short

of the moral good and so fails to discharge his moral duties and is

thus in need of forgiveness and redemption. Indeed, I think probably

no one comes to faith in Christ apart from a conviction of his guilt

and need of moral renovation.

You have good things to say about the theistic arguments I’ve

defended; but you do not mention my equally rigorous work, flowing

out of my doctoral studies under Wolfhart Pannenberg at the

University of Munich, on the historicity of Jesus’ resurrection. I was

astonished to discover as a result of my study that the main facts

undergirding the historicity of Jesus’ resurrection are actually agreed

upon by the majority of historical Jesus scholars today, not just

conservative scholars but the broad mainstream of New Testamentscholars, including a good number of Jewish scholars, who teach at

secular universities and non-evangelical divinity schools. So I think

faith in Jesus is historically quite well-founded.

So now we come to the million dollar question: “_What would YOU_

_suggest I do?_” I take this question very seriously. So here’s what I

suggest you do:

Read C. S. Lewis’ book _Surprised by Joy_. I think you will

resonate with Lewis’ struggle, both to free himself of atheism and

then of his scepticism about Christian faith.

Seek experiences that put you in touch with the transcendent.

You need to escape the cloying bonds of naturalism by catching

glimpses of a transcendent reality beyond the material world.

This will help to prepare your heart for belief in God. So open

yourself to experiences of sublime beauty. Listen

to Schumann’s _Träumerei_, to Dvorak’s _New World Symphony_,

to Rimsky-Korsakov’s _Scheherazade_, and so on. And when I say

“listen,” I don’t mean to have it playing in the background while

you go about your tasks. I mean to set all else aside for an

allotted time, close your eyes, and just focus on listening to the

music. Watch a video of ballroom champions Jonathan Crossley

and Lyn Marriner performing a waltz or slow foxtrot. Drink in

the stunning beauty of their performance. Watch a sunrise or

sunset over a beautiful landscape or take in the beauty of pristine

nature. Such beauty can sometimes produce an almost painful

ache in us because of our inability to take it all in.

Read the Gospels about the life of Jesus. If you haven’t already

done so, you’ll find the story of his life gripping. Jesus is a

tremendously attractive person in the wisdom of his teaching, inhis character, and in the authenticity of his life.

Look into the historical credibility of the personal claims and

resurrection of Jesus. Read, _e.g_., the relevant chapters

in _Reasonable Faith_ (Crossway, 2008). Read my debates with

sceptical New Testament critics like John Dominic Crossan (_Will_

_the Real Jesus Please Stand Up?,_ ed. Paul Copan \[Baker, 1998\]

or Gerd Lüdemann (_The Resurrection: Fact or Figment?_ ed.

Paul Copan \[Inter-Varsity, 2000\] and ask which way the

evidence points.

Embark on a spiritual experiment. Begin to pray daily. Attend a

church where the Gospel is faithfully preached and you can be

with Christians to get to know them. You’ll find these people to

be unlike ordinary people you meet, more reflective, more

compassionate, more focused on spiritual things.

Finally, get a copy of Francis Thompson’s poem “The Hound of

Heaven.” The person it describes is you, Adam! “With

unhurrying chase, and unperturbèd pace, deliberate speed,

majestic instancy,” He is after you and will continue His pursuit

until you recognize in Him all that you are longing for.

\*FOOTNOTE ON LUTHER AND THE HOLY SPIRIT'S GUIDANCE WHEN READING THE BIBLE

#perplexity

* * *

<br>

Martin Luther's views on the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding individuals when reading the Bible are well-documented and align with his broader theological principles:

<br>

\- \*\*Luther's Emphasis on the Holy Spirit\*\*: Luther believed that the Holy Spirit was essential for understanding the Scriptures. He emphasized that the Spirit works through the Word of God, not apart from it. This is evident in his explanation of the Third Article of the Apostle’s Creed, where he states that the Holy Spirit calls, gathers, enlightens, and sanctifies the whole Christian church on earth through the Gospel \[1\]. 

<br>

\- \*\*Scripture Interprets Scripture\*\*: Luther's principle of "Scripture interprets Scripture" implies that the Holy Spirit, who inspired the Scriptures, would guide the reader to understand the Bible correctly. This approach was meant to ensure that the interpretation remained faithful to the text and its intended meaning, rather than being subject to human whims or ecclesiastical control \[7\].

<br>

\- \*\*The External Word\*\*: Luther referred to the Bible as the "external Word," emphasizing its objectivity and its role as the medium through which the Holy Spirit works. He argued that the Spirit does not operate independently of this external Word but through it, ensuring that the message of salvation in Christ is clear and accessible to all \[5\].

<br>

\- \*\*Against Control Over Interpretation\*\*: Luther's translation of the Bible into vernacular German was a direct challenge to the Catholic Church's control over biblical interpretation. By making the Bible accessible to ordinary people, he implicitly trusted that the Holy Spirit would guide them in understanding the Scriptures, thereby reducing the need for clerical mediation \[9\]\[21\].

<br>

\- \*\*Luther's Critique of the Catholic Church\*\*: Luther criticized the Catholic Church for restricting access to the Bible, arguing that this was done to maintain control over interpretation. His translation efforts were part of his broader reformation movement to return to the Bible as the primary source of Christian teaching, rather than relying on Church hierarchy or tradition \[3\]\[23\].

<br>

\- \*\*The Role of the Holy Spirit in Reading\*\*: Luther did not explicitly state that the Holy Spirit would guide people in reading the Bible in a way that would negate the need for concern over misinterpretation. However, his theology implies this. He believed that the Holy Spirit would work through the Scriptures to bring individuals to faith and understanding, thus reducing the need for the Church's control over interpretation \[1\]\[5\]\[10\].

<br>

In summary, while Luther did not directly address the concern about taking power away from the Catholic Church in the context of Bible reading, his theological framework suggests that he trusted the Holy Spirit to guide individuals in their reading of the Scriptures. This trust was part of his broader critique of the Catholic Church's practices and his advocacy for the accessibility of the Bible to all, which inherently challenged the Church's control over biblical interpretation. Luther's emphasis was on the clarity of Scripture and the work of the Holy Spirit through the Word, which would naturally lead to a more democratized understanding of the Bible, reducing the need for clerical mediation.
