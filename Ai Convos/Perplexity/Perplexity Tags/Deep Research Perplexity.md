# Nihiltheism: The Ontological Synthesis of Nihilism and Theism

Nihiltheism represents a profound philosophical framework that attempts to reconcile two seemingly contradictory worldviews: nihilism, with its assertion that existence lacks inherent meaning, and theism, which affirms the reality of the divine or transcendent. This apparent paradox forms the foundation of a unique ontological perspective that challenges conventional philosophical boundaries while opening new pathways for understanding existence, meaning, and transcendence. Far from being merely an abstract theoretical construct, Nihiltheism offers a comprehensive lens through which to examine the fundamental questions of being and nothingness, purpose and void, despair and transcendence. This philosophical approach invites us to reconsider our understanding of both nihilism and theism, suggesting that their synthesis may provide deeper insights than either perspective alone.

## The Foundations of Nihilism

Nihilism, derived from the Latin "nihil" meaning "nothing," encompasses a family of philosophical positions that reject or negate certain aspects of existence. Different forms of nihilism deny different features of reality, ranging from the meaningfulness of life to the existence of moral truths, knowledge, or even reality itself. Existential nihilism asserts that life has no inherent meaning or higher purpose, suggesting that all individual and societal achievements are ultimately pointless. This perspective can lead to indifference, lack of motivation, and existential crises, as individuals confront the apparent meaninglessness of their existence[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism). Moral nihilism denies the objective existence of ethical truths, arguing that moral judgments rest on misguided assumptions without substantial connection to external reality[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism).

In the realm of epistemology, nihilism questions our capacity to know or understand reality. Relativistic versions assert that knowledge, truth, and meaning are relative to specific perspectives, implying there is no independent framework to determine which viewpoint is ultimately correct. More radical skeptical interpretations deny the existence of knowledge or truth altogether[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism). Metaphysical or ontological nihilism addresses the fundamental nature of reality, with some versions suggesting that an empty world is possible—that it is merely contingent, not necessary, that anything exists at all[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism).

Friedrich Nietzsche stands as perhaps the most influential philosopher associated with nihilism, understanding it as a pervasive cultural phenomenon in which traditional values lose their power. His famous pronouncement that "God is dead" heralded not merely the decline of religious faith but the collapse of the foundational structures of meaning and morality in Western society[6](https://iep.utm.edu/nihilism/). For Nietzsche, nihilism represented both a profound crisis and a potential opportunity—the chance to overcome traditional values and create new ones through the will to power and the concept of the Übermensch[5](https://www.bookey.app/book/nihilism).

The historical development of nihilism is closely tied to modernity in the Western world, evolving primarily in the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly in Germany and Russia. The term gained popularity through Ivan Turgenev's novel "Fathers and Sons," which featured a nihilist character named Bazarov who rejected traditional values and authority[14](https://www.britannica.com/topic/nihilism). Russian nihilism inspired revolutionary movements, including figures like Vladimir Lenin, while in the 20th century, nihilist themes were explored by Dadaism, existentialism, and postmodern philosophy[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism).

## Theistic Frameworks and Transcendence

Theism, in contrast to nihilism, affirms the existence of a divine reality, typically conceived as a supreme being or transcendent entity that exists beyond the material world. Traditional theistic frameworks generally posit that this divine reality provides the foundation for meaning, purpose, morality, and existence itself. Classical theism, as developed in Western philosophical and theological traditions, conceives of God as omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good—the source and ground of all being. This perspective naturally stands in stark opposition to nihilistic claims about the absence of inherent meaning or purpose in existence.

However, theistic traditions are far more diverse and nuanced than this classical conception suggests. Eastern traditions such as Buddhism, for instance, incorporate concepts like Śūnyatā (emptiness) that appear to share certain features with nihilistic thought while simultaneously affirming transcendent realities. The Buddhist notion of emptiness denies the substantiality of all phenomena without necessarily denying their existence or value altogether. Instead, it suggests that understanding the empty nature of reality can lead to liberation and enlightenment—a form of transcendence through recognition of the void.

Even within Western traditions, alternative conceptions of divinity have emerged that move beyond anthropomorphic notions of God as a supreme being with human-like qualities. Philosophical theologians like Paul Tillich have proposed understanding God as the "Ground of Being" rather than a being among others, suggesting that divinity might be conceived in more abstract, ontological terms rather than as a personal entity. Such reinterpretations open the possibility for more nuanced relationships between theistic and nihilistic perspectives.

The question of transcendence remains central to theistic frameworks. Transcendence typically refers to that which exists beyond the material or physical realm, pointing to realities that exceed ordinary human experience and understanding. Traditional theism locates transcendence in a divine realm separate from the world, while other approaches suggest that transcendence might be discovered within immanence—in the depths of existence itself rather than beyond it. This latter approach potentially creates space for a dialogue with certain forms of nihilism, particularly those that reject simplistic meanings without necessarily denying the possibility of profound significance.

## The Nihiltheistic Synthesis

Nihiltheism emerges as a philosophical perspective that attempts to reconcile the apparent contradiction between nihilistic negation and theistic affirmation. Rather than viewing these positions as mutually exclusive, Nihiltheism suggests that a deeper understanding of both nihilism and theism reveals potential points of convergence and complementarity. The term itself, combining "nihil" (nothing) with "theism" (belief in divine reality), suggests a paradoxical but potentially illuminating fusion of seemingly opposing worldviews[4](https://instabooks.ai/products/45351ff5-b725-151c-616c-00d609175cec).

At its core, Nihiltheism proposes that the nihilistic recognition of the absence of inherent meaning in the universe does not preclude the possibility of transcendent reality. Instead, it redefines divinity not as a meaning-giver in the traditional sense, but as that which encompasses and transcends both meaning and meaninglessness. The void or nothingness that nihilism identifies becomes reconceptualized as a form of divinity itself—not an anthropomorphic deity with prescribed attributes, but the ground of both being and non-being[4](https://instabooks.ai/products/45351ff5-b725-151c-616c-00d609175cec).

This perspective suggests a logical progression from nihilistic premises to a reinterpreted theism. If the universe lacks inherent meaning, then traditional concepts of a purpose-giving deity become untenable. However, if the void or nothingness itself is reconceived as divine—as that which transcends all categories including meaning and meaninglessness—then a form of theism emerges that does not contradict nihilistic insights. The conclusion forms the basis of Nihiltheism: recognizing the void as divine reconciles nihilism with a reinterpreted theism[4](https://instabooks.ai/products/45351ff5-b725-151c-616c-00d609175cec).

One key aspect of Nihiltheism lies in its reinterpretation of divinity. Unlike classical theism, which attributes anthropomorphic qualities and purpose-giving functions to God, Nihiltheism attributes divinity to the existential void itself. This radical shift challenges traditional theological concepts while opening space for new ontological insights. The divine is no longer conceptualized as a being that gives meaning to an otherwise meaningless existence, but as the very ground of both being and non-being, meaning and meaninglessness[4](https://instabooks.ai/products/45351ff5-b725-151c-616c-00d609175cec).

The existential dimension of Nihiltheism emphasizes that this philosophical perspective cannot be grasped through abstract reasoning alone. Rather, it requires an immersive engagement with existential feelings such as angst, despair, and ennui. These emotional experiences are not viewed as merely negative states to be overcome, but as potential pathways to deeper understanding. By fully confronting and exploring feelings of meaninglessness and despair, individuals may paradoxically discover a form of transcendence—not by escaping these feelings, but by moving through them toward a more profound relationship with existence itself[4](https://instabooks.ai/products/45351ff5-b725-151c-616c-00d609175cec).

## Comparative Philosophical Analysis

Nihiltheism draws from and engages with diverse philosophical traditions, finding resonances in both Eastern and Western thought. From Eastern philosophies, particularly Buddhism, Nihiltheism draws parallels with concepts like Śūnyatā or emptiness. In Buddhist thought, emptiness refers not to a nihilistic void but to the interdependent nature of all phenomena—their lack of independent, inherent existence. This perspective offers a middle way between nihilistic negation and metaphysical eternalism, suggesting that the recognition of emptiness leads not to despair but to liberation. Nihiltheism similarly proposes that confronting the void need not result in nihilistic despair but can open pathways to transcendence[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism).

In Western philosophy, Nihiltheism engages deeply with existentialist thought, particularly that of philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and Martin Heidegger. Sartre's exploration of nothingness as a constitutive aspect of human consciousness in "Being and Nothingness" provides important groundwork for understanding how nothingness can be integrated into a philosophy of existence rather than serving merely as its negation[5](https://www.bookey.app/book/nihilism). Heidegger's analysis of being (Sein) in relation to nothingness and his concept of "Being-toward-death" similarly offer resources for thinking through the relationship between existence and void[5](https://www.bookey.app/book/nihilism).

Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy, particularly his account of nihilism and his proposal for overcoming it through the creation of new values, forms another important touchstone for Nihiltheism. While Nietzsche proclaimed the death of God and the collapse of traditional values, he did not stop at nihilistic negation but advocated for a life-affirming response to nihilism through the will to power and the concept of the Übermensch. Nihiltheism shares this impulse to move through nihilism rather than merely stopping at its negative conclusions[6](https://iep.utm.edu/nihilism/).

Contemporary philosophical movements also provide contexts for understanding Nihiltheism. Phenomenology, with its emphasis on direct experience rather than abstract theorizing, aligns with Nihiltheism's insistence on existential immersion. Post-structuralist and postmodern philosophies, which question grand narratives and fixed meanings, share certain nihilistic elements while also opening spaces for reinterpreting traditional concepts, including divinity[6](https://iep.utm.edu/nihilism/).

The ontological exploration central to Nihiltheism investigates being as inextricably intertwined with non-being or nothingness. This parallels Heidegger's insight that Being and Nothing belong together, not as opposites but as complementary aspects of reality. For Nihiltheism, transcendence is achieved not by escaping the void but by embracing it—by recognizing the void not as the absence of divinity but as divinity itself. This perspective challenges conventional ontological frameworks while offering a unique approach to reconciling existence and nothingness[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism).

## Experiential Dimensions and Existential Resonance

The philosophical framework of Nihiltheism extends beyond abstract conceptualization into the realm of lived experience, suggesting that certain existential states provide privileged access to its insights. The experience of profound nihilistic despair—the confrontation with apparent meaninglessness and the void—becomes not merely a negative condition to overcome but a potential pathway to deeper understanding. Rather than fleeing from existential angst, Nihiltheism encourages a form of existential immersion, a willingness to dwell within states of despair, doubt, and meaninglessness as a means of accessing deeper truths about existence[4](https://instabooks.ai/products/45351ff5-b725-151c-616c-00d609175cec).

This approach resonates with existentialist perspectives, particularly Kierkegaard's notion of despair as potentially revelatory and Heidegger's concept of anxiety (Angst) as disclosing fundamental aspects of Being. The emotional landscape of Nihiltheism encompasses not only despair and anxiety but also a range of existential feelings including ennui, melancholy, and a sense of cosmic insignificance. These feelings are reconceived not as pathological states but as authentic responses to existence that can lead to profound insights when fully embraced and explored[5](https://www.bookey.app/book/nihilism).

The experiential dimension of Nihiltheism suggests that intellectual understanding alone is insufficient for grasping its core insights. One must undergo a form of existential transformation—a journey through the desert of meaninglessness—to arrive at the paradoxical recognition of transcendence within the void. This parallels certain mystical traditions that emphasize the importance of the "dark night of the soul" as a necessary stage in spiritual development. The difference lies in Nihiltheism's refusal to posit a traditional divinity waiting on the other side of darkness; instead, the darkness itself is reconceived as divine[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism).

This phenomenological aspect of Nihiltheism has implications for how individuals navigate existential crises and meaning-making processes. Rather than seeking to overcome or escape feelings of meaninglessness through distraction, conventional religiosity, or simplistic meaning-creation, Nihiltheism suggests a more radical approach: diving deeper into the experience of meaninglessness itself. This approach does not promise easy comfort but offers the possibility of a more authentic relationship with existence—one that neither denies the reality of the void nor succumbs to despair in the face of it[6](https://iep.utm.edu/nihilism/).

The existential resonance of Nihiltheism extends to questions of freedom and responsibility. If traditional foundations of meaning are absent and the void itself is divine, then individuals are radically free to create meaning while simultaneously recognizing the contingency of all such creations. This paradoxical position calls for a delicate balance between creative assertion and humble recognition of finitude—an authentic stance that neither inflates human significance nor diminishes the profound mystery of existence[5](https://www.bookey.app/book/nihilism).

## Implications for Modern Thought and Culture

Nihiltheism presents significant implications for contemporary philosophical discourse, religious understanding, and cultural expressions. In an age often characterized by what philosophers have called "the death of God" and the collapse of traditional meaning-structures, Nihiltheism offers a perspective that neither retreats to pre-modern certainties nor succumbs to postmodern relativism and despair. Instead, it suggests the possibility of finding transcendence precisely within the void that modernity has uncovered[6](https://iep.utm.edu/nihilism/).

For philosophical discourse, Nihiltheism challenges rigid distinctions between theistic and atheistic positions, suggesting that these categories may be less mutually exclusive than commonly assumed. By reconceptualizing divinity in relation to nothingness rather than as a supreme being, Nihiltheism opens new pathways for ontological exploration beyond traditional metaphysical frameworks. This approach aligns with certain aspects of continental philosophy, particularly phenomenology and hermeneutics, while offering a distinctive synthesis that may contribute to ongoing debates about meaning, existence, and transcendence[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism).

In relation to religious understanding, Nihiltheism presents both challenges and opportunities. It challenges traditional theistic conceptions of God as a meaning-giving entity separate from the world, suggesting instead that divinity might be found within the apparent meaninglessness that nihilism identifies. However, it also offers religious thought new possibilities for engaging with contemporary nihilistic tendencies without abandoning the concept of transcendence. This approach resonates with certain mystical traditions within various religions that emphasize the ineffability and emptiness of the divine—traditions that have often existed at the margins of mainstream religious discourse[10](https://lifespringchurch.net/210417-what-is-nihilism/).

Cultural expressions of Nihiltheism can be identified in various artistic movements and works that explore the tension between meaninglessness and transcendence. From the existentialist literature of Dostoevsky, Camus, and Sartre to the absurdist theater of Beckett, from the nihilistic themes in certain music genres to contemplative cinema that dwells in ambiguity and silence, artistic explorations of the void have often pointed toward transcendent dimensions within apparent meaninglessness. These cultural expressions suggest that Nihiltheism is not merely an abstract philosophical position but a lived perspective that resonates with human experience in the modern world[12](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism).

The ethical implications of Nihiltheism are particularly complex. If all values are ultimately groundless, as nihilism suggests, yet the void itself is divine, as Nihiltheism proposes, then a distinctive ethical approach emerges. This approach neither grounds ethics in divine commands nor reduces it to mere human convention. Instead, it suggests that ethical engagement might arise precisely from facing the groundlessness of values while still affirming the profound significance of ethical choices. This paradoxical stance avoids both absolutism and relativism while calling for a radical responsibility in the face of groundlessness[6](https://iep.utm.edu/nihilism/).

For individuals navigating existential questions in contemporary culture, Nihiltheism offers a framework that acknowledges the reality of nihilistic insights while suggesting that these insights need not lead to despair. By reframing the relationship between meaninglessness and transcendence, Nihiltheism provides resources for those seeking to live authentically in a world where traditional sources of meaning have been called into question[10](https://lifespringchurch.net/210417-what-is-nihilism/).

## Critical Perspectives and Philosophical Challenges

While Nihiltheism offers a provocative synthesis of nihilistic and theistic perspectives, it also faces significant philosophical challenges and critiques. Critical engagement with these challenges is essential for refining and developing the Nihiltheistic framework rather than merely defending it against objections. Several key areas of critique warrant particular attention.

One fundamental challenge concerns the coherence of attributing divinity to nothingness or the void. Traditional theological concepts define divinity in terms of being, goodness, and perfection—qualities that seem directly opposed to nothingness. Critics might argue that applying the concept of divinity to the void empties the term of its traditional meaning, rendering it virtually meaningless. This critique raises important questions about the limits of conceptual innovation and the degree to which traditional theological terms can be repurposed without losing their essential significance[6](https://iep.utm.edu/nihilism/).

From a strictly logical perspective, critics might challenge the apparent contradiction in Nihiltheism's central claim. If nihilism asserts that nothing has inherent meaning or value, including concepts like divinity, then how can the void itself be meaningfully described as divine? This critique points to potential logical inconsistencies in attempting to synthesize perspectives that may be fundamentally incompatible at the conceptual level[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism).

Religious traditionalists might further object that Nihiltheism distorts the concept of divinity beyond recognition, emptying it of the personal, loving qualities that define God in many religious traditions. From this perspective, Nihiltheism might appear as a form of sophisticated atheism rather than a genuine engagement with theistic concepts. This critique raises important questions about the relationship between philosophical theology and lived religious traditions, highlighting tensions between abstract conceptualization and embodied faith[10](https://lifespringchurch.net/210417-what-is-nihilism/).

From a nihilistic perspective, critics might argue that Nihiltheism fails to fully embrace the implications of nihilism by reintroducing a form of transcendence. True nihilism, on this view, would reject even the possibility of finding transcendent significance in the void. By attributing divinity to nothingness, Nihiltheism might appear to retreat from nihilism's most radical insights rather than embracing them fully[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism).

Epistemological challenges also arise regarding how knowledge of the divine void might be obtained. If this concept transcends rational categories and can only be grasped through existential immersion, questions emerge about its communicability and verification. This raises issues about the relationship between personal experience and philosophical argumentation, as well as concerns about the potential for subjectivism in Nihiltheistic claims[6](https://iep.utm.edu/nihilism/).

Practical objections might focus on the lived implications of Nihiltheism. Critics could argue that embracing the void as divine fails to provide sufficient resources for meaning-making, ethical guidance, or communal life. If Nihiltheism primarily offers a rarefied philosophical perspective rather than practical wisdom for navigating life's challenges, its value for addressing existential concerns might be limited[5](https://www.bookey.app/book/nihilism).

These critiques highlight important areas for further development within the Nihiltheistic framework. Rather than viewing them as definitive refutations, proponents of Nihiltheism might engage with these challenges as opportunities for clarification, refinement, and expansion of the basic intuition that the void and the divine may be more intimately related than traditional philosophical categories suggest[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism).

## Future Research Directions and Explorations

The exploration of Nihiltheism as a philosophical framework opens numerous avenues for future research and development across various domains of inquiry. These potential research directions encompass not only theoretical refinements but also empirical investigations, practical applications, and interdisciplinary connections.

Phenomenological research represents a particularly promising direction for further exploration of Nihiltheism. Given the emphasis on existential immersion and direct experience of the void as potentially revelatory, systematic phenomenological investigations of these experiences could provide valuable insights. Such research might examine the qualitative dimensions of nihilistic despair, the experience of transcendence within apparent meaninglessness, and the phenomenology of existential transformation. Both philosophical phenomenology in the tradition of Husserl and Heidegger and empirical phenomenological methods in psychology could contribute to this exploration[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism).

The philosophical foundation of Nihiltheism would benefit from further conceptual clarification and development. This includes more precise articulation of how divinity is reconceived in relation to nothingness, refinement of the logical framework for synthesizing nihilistic and theistic perspectives, and detailed engagement with potential philosophical objections. Critical dialogues with proponents of traditional theism, committed nihilists, and other philosophical perspectives would contribute to this conceptual refinement. Such dialogues would require genuine openness to critique rather than merely defensive responses[6](https://iep.utm.edu/nihilism/).

Interdisciplinary connections present another fertile area for future research. Nihiltheism might engage with contemporary neuroscience and cognitive science exploring the neural correlates of mystical experiences, including experiences of emptiness or void. Connections with quantum physics and its paradoxical insights about the relationship between being and non-being could also prove illuminating. Anthropological studies of cultural variations in concepts of nothingness, emptiness, and divinity would provide broader context for understanding Nihiltheism's potential cross-cultural relevance[3](https://philonotes.com/2023/04/how-to-design-a-research-project-related-to-daily-life).

The practical applications of Nihiltheism in domains such as psychotherapy, existential counseling, and spiritual guidance warrant exploration. Research might investigate how therapeutic approaches informed by Nihiltheistic insights could help individuals navigate existential crises, confront feelings of meaninglessness, and develop more authentic relationships with existence. Case studies of individuals who have moved through nihilistic despair toward a form of transcendence could provide valuable empirical data for such applications[5](https://www.bookey.app/book/nihilism).

In cultural domains, further examination of artistic expressions that embody Nihiltheistic themes could illuminate how this philosophical perspective manifests in literature, visual arts, music, and film. Creative works that explore the paradoxical relationship between meaninglessness and transcendence offer rich material for analysis and interpretation. Such cultural expressions might provide accessible entry points for individuals seeking to understand Nihiltheism beyond abstract philosophical formulations[7](https://coveteur.com/dating-a-gemini).

Ethical implications of Nihiltheism require further development, particularly regarding how this perspective might inform approaches to moral questions in both personal and social contexts. If traditional foundations for ethics are called into question while the void itself is recognized as divine, what ethical orientation emerges? How might Nihiltheism contribute to contemporary ethical debates about meaning, value, and responsibility in a world where traditional ethical frameworks have lost their self-evidence?[6](https://iep.utm.edu/nihilism/)

Finally, educational applications of Nihiltheistic insights merit exploration. Research might investigate how introducing students to the paradoxical relationship between nihilism and transcendence could foster deeper philosophical engagement and existential reflection. Pedagogical approaches that balance intellectual understanding with experiential dimensions would be particularly relevant for educational contexts[3](https://philonotes.com/2023/04/how-to-design-a-research-project-related-to-daily-life).

## Conclusion

Nihiltheism presents a profound philosophical framework that challenges conventional boundaries between nihilism and theism, suggesting that their synthesis offers insights unavailable to either perspective in isolation. By reconceptualizing the relationship between nothingness and divinity, Nihiltheism provides a unique ontological perspective that neither retreats from nihilistic insights nor abandons the possibility of transcendence. This philosophical approach invites us to consider that the void itself, rather than being opposed to divinity, might be understood as divine in a radically reconceived sense[4](https://instabooks.ai/products/45351ff5-b725-151c-616c-00d609175cec).

The journey through nihilistic despair toward transcendence represents not a linear progression but a dialectical movement that transforms both nihilism and theism. Nihilism is transformed by recognizing that the absence of inherent meaning need not lead to despair but might open pathways to a deeper form of significance. Theism is transformed by freeing the concept of divinity from traditional anthropomorphic limitations and recognizing its potential connection to nothingness and void. This mutual transformation suggests that Nihiltheism is not merely a compromise between opposing viewpoints but a distinctive philosophical perspective with its own integrity[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism).

The exploration of Nihiltheism remains ongoing, with numerous avenues for further research and development. From phenomenological investigations of existential experiences to conceptual refinements through critical dialogue, from interdisciplinary connections to practical applications, the Nihiltheistic framework offers rich possibilities for continued philosophical inquiry. These explorations may not only deepen our understanding of Nihiltheism itself but also contribute to broader philosophical discussions about meaning, existence, and transcendence in contemporary thought[6](https://iep.utm.edu/nihilism/).

For individuals navigating existential questions in a world where traditional sources of meaning have been called into question, Nihiltheism offers neither false comfort nor nihilistic despair. Instead, it suggests the possibility of finding profound significance precisely within the apparent meaninglessness that characterizes modern experience. This paradoxical stance requires courage, authenticity, and a willingness to dwell within existential tensions rather than seeking premature resolution through either naive affirmation or cynical negation[5](https://www.bookey.app/book/nihilism).

In the final analysis, Nihiltheism reminds us that the relationship between being and nothingness, meaning and meaninglessness, despair and transcendence may be more complex and intimate than our conventional categories suggest. By embracing rather than fleeing from this complexity, we may discover new possibilities for philosophical understanding and existential orientation in a world where both naive optimism and thoroughgoing nihilism have revealed their limitations. The void, when confronted with courage and openness, may disclose dimensions of existence that transcend our traditional conceptions while simultaneously transforming our understanding of transcendence itself[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism)[4](https://instabooks.ai/products/45351ff5-b725-151c-616c-00d609175cec).
