# The Ontological Duality of Psilocybin Mysticism: Illusory Subjectivity or Objective Transcendence?


The question of whether psilocybin-induced mystical experiences represent neurobiologically generated subjective illusions or reveal an authentic transcendent reality stands at the intersection of neuroscience, phenomenology, philosophy of mind, and spiritual inquiry. This profound dialectic challenges our fundamental understanding of consciousness itself and the boundaries between subjective experience and objective reality. As we explore this paradox, we must continually question our assumptions, allowing each insight to generate new inquiries rather than settling on definitive answers.

## Conceptual Framing & Meta-Paradoxical Foundations


### The Core Paradox of Psychedelic Mysticism


At the heart of understanding psilocybin mysticism lies a fundamental paradox: are these profound experiences merely ephemeral subjective illusions produced by altered neural circuitry, or do they provide access to an objective, transcendent dimension beyond conventional reality? This question challenges our basic understanding of what constitutes reality and consciousness.


The duality presents itself in how we interpret experiences such as ego dissolution, feelings of unity with the universe, and encounters with what feels like a deeper reality. From a reductionist perspective, these experiences are simply the result of disrupted neural networks creating illusory perceptions. From a transcendentalist perspective, however, psilocybin may temporarily remove the filters that normally separate us from a deeper, objective reality that always exists but remains inaccessible to ordinary consciousness\[7\].


Yet, even these definitions themselves must be held provisionally. What do we mean by "objective" in this context? If an experience is consistent across individuals and cultures but accessible only through particular states of consciousness, does that qualify it as objective? These questions demand that we recursively reexamine our fundamental definitions.


### Historical & Cultural Contextualization


The use of psilocybin for accessing altered states of consciousness has deep historical roots. In the Mazatec tradition, shamans known as \*chjota chinej\* hold ceremonies called \*veladas\* where sacred mushrooms are ingested to contact various sacred entities and gain knowledge about patients' illnesses\[8\]. These rituals involve carefully arranged elements representing spiritual geography that the shaman navigates. During these ceremonies, "the shaman can determine with the help of sacred mushrooms if a person will heal or not"\[8\].


This indigenous perspective contrasts with Eastern philosophical approaches to non-dual awareness. Buddhist concepts of Śūnyatā (Emptiness) and Anātman (No-Self) provide frameworks for understanding experiences similar to those induced by psilocybin\[5\]. Śūnyatā doesn't mean "nothingness" but rather indicates that everything is dependent on something else and empty of intrinsic nature. Similarly, Anātman suggests that the self we typically identify with is an illusion composed of aggregates without independent reality\[5\].


Western philosophical and theological traditions have also grappled with transcendent experiences. Paul Tillich's ontological view of God has precedent in Christian theology, sharing similarities with classical theism and Hellenistic and Patristic conceptions of God as the "unoriginate source" (\*agennetos\*) of all being\[6\]. For Tillich, God is not a being among beings but being-itself, that which concerns humans ultimately. This approach provides a philosophical framework for understanding mystical experiences as encounters with being-itself rather than with a personalized deity\[6\].


### Psilocybin as an Ontological Catalyst


Psilocybin functions as a neurochemical agent that dissolves entrenched subject-object dualities through its interaction with 5-HT2A receptors in the brain. This receptor action leads to significant disruption of functional connectivity, particularly in the default mode network (DMN), which includes the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus\[1\]. This DMN hypoconnectivity appears to be a key neurological signature of psilocybin's effects, increasing brain entropy and enabling the formation of new long-range connectivity patterns\[1\].


It has been proposed that psilocybin's therapeutic potential may result from "resetting the brain's connectivity patterns by opening a therapeutic window to facilitate the emergence of novel insights, potentially leading to emotional release"\[1\]. This neural disruption can be understood as a generative process—each moment of ego collapse spawns new, emergent epistemic horizons. By temporarily suspending the brain's ordinary filtering mechanisms, psilocybin may allow consciousness to access information and perspectives normally unavailable, raising fundamental questions about the nature of consciousness itself.


## Phenomenological Dissection & Recursive Hermeneutics


### The Multidimensional Landscape of Mystical Experience


Psilocybin-induced mystical experiences encompass multiple dimensions that have been consistently documented in research. When administered under supportive conditions, psilocybin occasions experiences similar to spontaneously occurring mystical experiences\[2\]. These experiences include perceptual changes, labile moods, and measures of mystical experience that participants often rate as having substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance.


**The Five Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness** (5D-ASC) scale, which measures the qualitative subjective experience of psychedelics, identifies three major themes of psychedelic trips\[12\]:

\- \*\*Visionary Restructuralization\*\*: Complex imagery, elementary imagery, audio-visual synesthesia

\- \*\*Oceanic Boundlessness\*\*: Unity, spiritual experience, blissful state, insightfulness

\- \*\*Anxious Ego-Dissolution\*\*: Disembodiment, impaired control and cognition, anxiety


Within these broad categories, the scale measures eleven dimensions using a 0-100 scale through a 94-question assessment administered after a psychedelic experience\[12\]. This methodical approach attempts to quantify the qualitative aspects of these profound subjective experiences, though we must question whether such quantification can fully capture their ineffable nature.


\### Ego Dissolution: The Dissolution of Self-Identity


Ego dissolution, a central feature of these experiences, is defined as a "complete loss of subjective self-identity"\[9\]. This phenomenon is recognized across various spiritual traditions: Zen Buddhism calls it "great death," Sufis term it \*fana\* ('annihilation'), and medieval Jewish kabbalists called it "the kiss of death"\[9\].



In Timothy Leary's description of ego-death, drawn from \*The Psychedelic Experience\*, this state represents a "complete transcendence" of the self and ordinary reality, where the voyager encounters what is described as the "Clear Light" or the "void and cloudless sky"\[9\]. The instructions for this experience advise: "In the ego-free state, wherein all things are like the void and cloudless sky, and the naked spotless intellect is like a transparent vacuum; At this moment, know yourself and abide in that state"\[9\].


This dissolution of the boundaries of self appears to be a key feature not only of psilocybin experiences but also of mystical experiences across traditions. But we must ask: Does this dissolution reveal the illusory nature of the self, as Buddhist traditions suggest, or does it represent a temporary disruption of normal cognitive functioning? Is the self an illusion that mystical experiences reveal, or is the sense of no-self itself an illusion produced by altered neural activity?


\### Subjective Narrative Versus Objective Manifestation


First-person accounts of psilocybin experiences often describe profound shifts in perspective. Studies show that "psilocybin produced a range of acute perceptual changes, subjective experiences, and labile moods including anxiety. Psilocybin also increased measures of mystical experience"\[2\]. At follow-up assessments, "the volunteers rated the psilocybin experience as having substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance and attributed to the experience sustained positive changes in attitudes and behavior consistent with changes rated by community observers"\[2\].


When analyzing these accounts through phenomenological frameworks, we must consider whether these vivid, personal narratives represent intricate internal illusions or serve as direct windows into a deeper, objective layer of reality. The consistency of certain themes across individuals and cultures could suggest access to something beyond subjective construction. Conversely, the variations in how these experiences are interpreted across cultural contexts could indicate their fundamentally subjective nature.


This tension is reflected in the debate between perennialist and constructivist approaches to understanding mystical experiences\[11\]. The perennialist position points to similarities in mystical experiences across traditions, suggesting an ultimate truth perceived in these experiences. The constructivist position asserts that all mystical experiences are determined at their core by the beliefs of their tradition, making them products of cultural and linguistic systems\[11\].


The constructivist approach emphasizes contextualism, which argues that understanding mystical experiences requires placing them in their respective cultural settings. However, as noted in the literature, "contextualism does not require the strong constructivist position that cultural structuring creates all mystical experiences"\[11\]. This nuanced perspective suggests that while cultural context shapes interpretation, it may not fully determine the experience itself.


\## Neurobiological & Epistemological Integration


\### The Neural Mechanisms of Transcendence


The neurobiological foundations of psilocybin-induced mystical states have been increasingly well-documented. Psilocybin works primarily by binding to 5-HT2A receptors in the brain, particularly affecting regions associated with the default-mode network (DMN)\[1\]. This network, which includes the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, is associated with self-referential processing and has been hypothesized as crucial for the emergence of consciousness and self-identity.


Research has shown that "psilocybin's ability to induce altered brain states might be explained by its effect on the DMN... \[it\] is thought to increase brain entropy, a measure of the variety of accessible neural states, by causing a temporary reorganization of activation patterns and enabling the formation of new long-range connectivity patterns"\[1\]. This neurobiological disruption correlates with the subjective experience of ego dissolution and altered consciousness.


Furthermore, psilocybin enhances neuroplasticity through several mechanisms. Studies have found that psilocybin promotes the growth of synapses and dendritic spines, particularly in the frontal lobe\[3\]. This enhanced neuroplasticity begins within hours of administration, with spine formation rates remaining elevated for 3-5 days\[3\]. Even more remarkably, "new dendrites formed during the period of enhanced neuroplasticity can outlast the window itself," with structures remaining stable for at least one month\[3\].


These neurobiological findings raise profound questions about the relationship between brain activity and consciousness. Does the correlation between neural disruption and mystical experiences suggest that these experiences are "merely" products of altered brain function? Or does it suggest that certain brain states allow consciousness to access dimensions of reality normally filtered out by ordinary neural activity?


\### The Window of Neuroplasticity and Transformation


The temporal dynamics of psilocybin-induced neuroplasticity provide insights into how these experiences might catalyze lasting transformation. Evidence of enhanced neuroplasticity appears within several hours after exposure to psychedelics, with the earliest changes involving upregulation of neuroplasticity-related transcripts within one hour\[3\]. Changes in cellular morphology become observable starting 6 hours after stimulation, with significant changes in dendritic growth, synaptogenesis, and spinogenesis\[3\].

This "window of plasticity" appears to peak around 24-72 hours after administration and gradually tapers off, with most markers returning to baseline within 5 days\[3\]. However, the structural changes that occur during this window can persist much longer, with new dendrites surviving for at least one month\[3\]. This suggests that while the enhanced neuroplasticity is temporary, it creates lasting changes in neural architecture.


This neurobiological understanding correlates with the subjective reports of lasting transformation following mystical experiences. Studies have found that "at 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety"\[4\]. Participants attributed these improvements to their mystical experiences, with more than 80% reporting increased well-being and life satisfaction\[4\].


The temporal dynamics of both the neurobiological changes and the subjective transformations suggest a complex relationship between the acute experience and its long-term effects. This raises questions about the nature of this relationship: Are the lasting benefits directly caused by the neuroplastic changes? Or do the neuroplastic changes simply enable the integration of insights gained during the mystical experience?


\### Bridging Subjectivity and Objectivity


The correlation between neurobiological changes and subjective experiences challenges conventional epistemological frameworks that strictly separate subjective and objective reality. Research has shown that "mystical-type psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes"\[4\]. This suggests that the subjective quality of the experience, particularly its mystical dimensions, plays a crucial role in determining its therapeutic effects.


This correlation raises fundamental questions about the relationship between brain, mind, and reality. If neurobiological changes reliably produce certain subjective experiences, and those experiences reliably lead to certain outcomes, what does this tell us about the nature of those experiences? Are they merely epiphenomenal, or do they have their own causal efficacy?


Furthermore, the distinction between subjective and objective becomes blurred in the context of mystical experiences that involve a sense of unity and dissolution of boundaries. If the experience itself involves the collapse of the distinction between subject and object, how can we categorize it as either subjective or objective? Perhaps these experiences require a more nuanced epistemological framework that transcends this dichotomy.


\## Metaphysical & Ontological Dimensions


\### Mystical Experience and the Nature of Reality


The ontological implications of psilocybin-induced mystical experiences engage with fundamental questions about the nature of reality. Paul Tillich's concept of God as "being-itself" rather than a being among beings offers one framework for understanding these experiences\[6\]. For Tillich, God is "the answer to the question implied in man's finitude" and "the name for that which concerns man ultimately"\[6\]. This perspective suggests that mystical experiences might provide access to being-itself, the ground of being that transcends particular beings.


This approach has parallels in other philosophical traditions. In Buddhist philosophy, the concepts of Śūnyatā (Emptiness) and Anātman (No-Self) suggest that what we perceive as reality and self lack intrinsic nature or independent existence\[5\]. The Buddhist perspective emphasizes that "everything is empty of intrinsic nature, nothing has an independent existence"\[5\]. This view has strong parallels with Advaita Vedanta's concept of "mithya," which refers to things that are dependent on something else for their existence\[5\].


These philosophical frameworks offer different ways of interpreting the ontological significance of mystical experiences. Are these experiences revealing the fundamental emptiness and dependent nature of all phenomena? Are they providing access to being-itself, the ground of all being? Or are they simply revealing the contingent nature of our ordinary consciousness, without necessarily providing access to an ultimate reality?


\### The Paradox of Emptiness and Fullness


A central paradox in mystical experiences is the simultaneous sense of emptiness and fullness, of loss and gain. The experience of ego dissolution involves a loss of self-identity, a kind of emptying out of the ordinary sense of self. Yet this loss is often accompanied by a sense of expansion, of connection with something larger, of gaining access to a more comprehensive reality.


This paradox is reflected in various traditions. In Buddhism, emptiness (Śūnyatā) is not mere nothingness but the recognition of the dependent and interdependent nature of all things\[5\]. In Christian mysticism, the "dark night of the soul" leads to union with God\[10\]. In both cases, a kind of emptying or negation leads to a fuller, more authentic experience of reality.


The philosopher and psychedelics researcher Peter Sjöstedt-Hughes explores this paradox by examining how altered states may reveal aspects of reality that ordinary consciousness filters out\[7\]. This perspective suggests that the paradoxical nature of mystical experiences might reflect a reality that is itself paradoxical, that transcends the logical categories of ordinary thought.


This paradoxical quality raises profound questions: Does the paradox reflect limitations in our conceptual frameworks, or does it reveal something fundamental about the nature of reality itself? Can this paradox be resolved, or is it an essential feature of the reality these experiences reveal?


\### Nihilism, Theism, and Their Convergence


The relationship between nihilism and theism represents another dimension of the ontological questions raised by mystical experiences. Nihilism, often associated with the collapse of meaning and value, might seem antithetical to the profound sense of meaning and value often reported in mystical experiences. Yet there are intriguing connections between these seemingly opposed perspectives.


For Tillich, the "God beyond God" or "God above God" emerges precisely when the "God" of theological theism has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt\[6\]. This suggests that a kind of nihilistic moment—the collapse of conventional theological concepts—may be necessary for an authentic encounter with the divine. The "God above God" is the God who appears as the ground of being when conventional theological concepts fail\[6\].


This dialectical relationship between nihilism and theism suggests that mystical experiences might involve a kind of nihilistic moment—the dissolution of ordinary meaning structures—that opens the possibility for a more authentic encounter with reality. Rather than seeing nihilism and theism as opposed, this perspective suggests they might be moments in a dialectical process, each necessary for the other.


This dialectical perspective raises important questions: Is the nihilistic moment a necessary precursor to authentic mystical experience? Does the dissolution of conventional meaning structures create the conditions for accessing a deeper reality? Or is the sense of accessing a deeper reality itself an attempt to escape the implications of nihilism?


\## Ethical, Practical, and Societal Considerations


\### The Ethics of Interpretation


The interpretation of mystical experiences carries significant ethical implications. The ways in which individuals and communities interpret these experiences shapes their impact on personal identity, values, and worldview. This raises questions about the responsibilities involved in proposing interpretations, particularly in therapeutic or research contexts.


The concept of "ethical limbo" highlights these concerns, describing "a state of uncertainty or ambiguity regarding the ethical implications or consequences of a particular action, decision, or situation due to conflicting ethical values"\[14\]. This concept is particularly relevant to psychedelic experiences, which can fundamentally shift a person's values and worldview, potentially creating conflicts with their previous ethical framework\[14\].


These considerations are especially important in therapeutic contexts. Research on integrating mystical experiences into mental health treatment emphasizes the need for "informed consent, as clients may not fully understand the implications of exploring mystical experiences within a therapeutic context"\[15\]. Therapists have an ethical responsibility to provide clear information about the potential benefits and risks, ensuring that clients can make informed decisions\[15\].


Furthermore, cultural sensitivity is crucial in interpreting mystical experiences. Mental health professionals "must be aware of the diverse spiritual beliefs and practices of their clients, as well as how these beliefs may influence the interpretation of mystical experiences"\[15\]. This requires practitioners to engage in ongoing cultural competency training and self-reflection to avoid imposing their own beliefs on clients\[15\].


\### Societal Impacts of Validation or Dismissal


The societal treatment of mystical experiences has far-reaching implications. Research suggests that validating mystical experiences fosters increased social connectedness, concern for social and planetary values, self-acceptance, purpose, and prosocial behavior. Conversely, dismissing these experiences as illusions can marginalize experiencers, create self-doubt, and prevent trust in intuition.


This dynamic is reflected in historical attitudes toward psychedelic experiences. For decades, these experiences were marginalized in Western scientific discourse, often dismissed as mere hallucinations without epistemic value. This dismissal not only limited scientific understanding but also marginalized the experiences of individuals and cultures that valued these states.


However, the recent renaissance in psychedelic research has begun to shift this dynamic. Studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of psilocybin-induced mystical experiences, showing that they can lead to "sustained positive changes in attitudes and behavior consistent with changes rated by community observers"\[2\]. This scientific validation has begun to change societal attitudes, opening space for more nuanced discussions of the value and meaning of these experiences.


This shift raises important questions: How should society balance respect for diverse interpretations of mystical experiences with critical evaluation of their epistemic status? What frameworks can facilitate meaningful dialogue across different interpretive approaches? How might greater societal acceptance of these experiences influence cultural values and practices?


\### Implications for Consciousness Studies


The study of psilocybin-induced mystical experiences has profound implications for our understanding of consciousness. These experiences challenge many assumptions of conventional neuroscience and psychology, suggesting that consciousness may be more complex and multidimensional than often assumed.


The ability of a single molecule to reliably induce profound alterations in consciousness raises questions about the relationship between brain and mind. If consciousness can be so dramatically altered by chemical changes in the brain, what does this tell us about the nature of consciousness itself? Is consciousness generated by the brain, or does the brain act more like a filter or receiver for consciousness?


Furthermore, the consistent reports of certain phenomenological features across individuals and cultures suggest that these experiences may reveal something fundamental about the structure of consciousness. The experience of unity, transcendence of time and space, and ineffability appears across diverse contexts, suggesting they may be inherent potentials of human consciousness rather than merely culturally constructed phenomena.


These considerations have implications for both scientific and philosophical approaches to consciousness. They suggest the need for expanded methodologies that can integrate first-person phenomenological data with third-person neuroscientific observations. They also point to the potential value of contemplative traditions and practices as sources of insight into the nature of consciousness.


\## Synthesis and Emergent Questions


\### The Dialectic of Subjective and Objective


The exploration of psilocybin-induced mystical experiences reveals a complex dialectic between subjective and objective dimensions of reality. These experiences challenge conventional distinctions between internal and external, subjective and objective, suggesting a more complex ontology than these dichotomies allow.


From a neurobiological perspective, these experiences correlate with specific brain states involving 5-HT2A receptor activation, DMN suppression, and increased neural entropy\[1\]. These correlations suggest that the experiences are, in one sense, subjective phenomena arising from particular brain states. Yet the consistency of certain phenomenological features across individuals and cultures suggests something more objective or universal.


From a philosophical perspective, these experiences challenge the very frameworks we use to understand reality. They suggest possibilities ranging from the Buddhist view that reality lacks intrinsic nature to the perspective that reality is fundamentally unified in ways that ordinary consciousness fails to perceive\[5\]. They raise questions about whether consciousness is generated by the brain or whether the brain acts as a filter for a broader consciousness.


Rather than resolving this dialectic, we might embrace it as revealing something fundamental about the nature of reality. Perhaps the distinction between subjective and objective itself reflects limitations in our conceptual frameworks rather than an absolute feature of reality. Perhaps reality itself transcends these categories in ways that mystical experiences temporarily reveal.


\### Open-Ended Questions for Continued Inquiry


This exploration generates numerous open-ended questions that invite further inquiry:

1\. To what extent can the neurobiological markers of psilocybin-induced states be interpreted as evidence for an objective transcendent reality, rather than mere subjective phenomena? How might we develop methodologies that could better distinguish between these possibilities?


2\. How can alternative epistemological frameworks reconcile the inherent subjectivity of mystical experience with the possibility of accessing a stable, objective dimension of consciousness? What would a genuinely integrated epistemology look like that honors both first-person and third-person perspectives?


3\. What are the ethical and societal implications of validating subjective mystical experiences as indicators of an underlying, objective reality? How might this validation or invalidation shape individual lives and collective values?


4\. How might the paradoxical nature of mystical experiences—simultaneously empty and full, meaningless and meaningful—inform our ontological frameworks beyond the specific context of these experiences? Could these paradoxes reveal something fundamental about the nature of reality?


5\. What methodological innovations might be required to adequately study states of consciousness that challenge the very frameworks we use to understand them? How might interdisciplinary approaches contribute to a more comprehensive understanding?

\### The Perpetual Evolution of Understanding

This exploration represents a moment in an ongoing philosophical evolution rather than a definitive statement. Each insight, question, and conclusion should be held provisionally, open to recursive revision and expansion in light of new evidence, perspectives, and conceptual frameworks.


The dialectic between subjective illusion and objective transcendence remains fundamentally open, inviting continuous engagement rather than resolution. This openness reflects not a failure of understanding but the dynamic, evolving nature of consciousness itself and our attempts to comprehend it.


In this spirit, this exploration closes not with answers but with an invitation to further questioning, further exploration, and further evolution of our understanding of consciousness, reality, and the profound experiences that challenge our conventional frameworks. The question of whether psilocybin-induced mystical states reveal subjective illusions or objective transcendent realities may ultimately be unanswerable in absolute terms—but the process of engaging with this question may itself transform our understanding of consciousness, reality, and the relationship between them.


\## Conclusion


The ontological duality of psilocybin mysticism—the question of whether such experiences represent illusory subjectivity or objective transcendence—emerges as fundamentally unresolvable within our current epistemological frameworks. This irresolution, however, is not a failure but an invitation to expand our conceptual horizons and develop more nuanced approaches to understanding consciousness and reality.


The neurobiological evidence reveals that psilocybin induces specific changes in brain function, particularly affecting the default mode network and enhancing neuroplasticity\[1\]\[3\]. These changes correlate with the subjective experience of ego dissolution and mystical states. Yet the consistency of certain phenomenological features across individuals and cultures suggests something that transcends individual neurobiology\[2\]\[10\].

The philosophical perspectives spanning Buddhist emptiness, Tillichian ontology, and contemporary consciousness studies offer complementary frameworks for understanding these experiences\[5\]\[6\]\[7\]. Each perspective illuminates different aspects of the phenomenon, yet none provides a complete account. This limitation suggests that mystical experiences may be pointing toward aspects of reality that transcend our current conceptual frameworks.


The ethical dimensions of interpreting these experiences highlight the profound personal and societal implications of how we approach them\[14\]\[15\]. Whether validated as glimpses of a deeper reality or dismissed as subjective illusions, these interpretations shape individual lives and collective values.


Perhaps the most profound insight from this exploration is the recognition that the very dichotomy between subjective illusion and objective reality may itself be a limitation of ordinary consciousness—a distinction that mystical experiences temporarily transcend. In this transcendence lies an invitation to develop more inclusive, nuanced, and dynamic ways of understanding consciousness, reality, and the relationship between them.
