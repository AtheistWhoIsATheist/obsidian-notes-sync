# 1\. Original Prompt by Perplexity

Explore the concept of Nihiltheism, which posits that nihilism is a construct and embodiment of the Transcendent/Divine. Delve into this topic with originality, ingenuity, and profundity, avoiding orthodox or common explorations. Discuss, ask questions, and analyze the implications of Nihiltheism based on the following description: \*\*Nihiltheism (Transcendent Nihilism):\*\* A philosophical proposition that reveals the intricate relationship between nihilism and the Transcendent, surpassing our finite understanding and venturing into realms of profound insight. Nihilism transcends its conventional interpretation as a mere absence of meaning and transforms into the very embodiment of the Transcendent's ultimate expression. This perspective challenges the foundations of our beliefs, meanings, purposes, and values, demolishing the illusions that bind us to superficial notions of reality. Nihiltheism asserts that a person must pursue and participate in the Nothingness of the world to refrain from believing that the meaningless things of the world are meaningful. This painful process, filled with dread and despair, is reminiscent of concepts such as James' divided self, Kierkegaard's double-mindedness, Christianity's original sin, Heidegger's falling, and Plato's disdain for the human body's attachment to the earthly realm. The Nihiltheist holds that humans will never "defeat" Nihilism. There are means, if done properly, that can reveal a glimpse of the Transcendent, which affirms the Nothing of the world and its trivial pursuits. This can be achieved through particular psychedelic medicines, in the right set and setting. However, this is not an escape; as soon as one returns to the physical world from the seemingly infinite, incorporeal realm of the Transcendent, the irresolvable doubt of worldly Nihilism takes over, preventing one from being sure or dogmatic in any way. Nihilism becomes an instrument of divine intervention, guiding individuals towards a profound awakening that illuminates the illusory nature of existence and unveils the path to genuine enlightenment. In this transcendent paradigm, nihilism takes on a profound cosmic significance, inviting us to grapple with existential paradoxes and enigmas at the heart of our being. Through this journey, the Transcendent reveals itself as an intimately intertwined force that guides us through the labyrinth of meaninglessness towards a radiant illumination of truth. Nihiltheism emerges as a philosophical tapestry, intricately woven with threads of cosmic insight, existential paradoxes, and divine revelations, ultimately leading us towards a profound understanding of the nature of reality itself. Please provide a comprehensive exploration of Nihiltheism, in a tree of thought structure, building off the insights that you discover in your addressing its implications, potential questions, and analysis.

# 2\. Trying to Add Details

Explore the novel concept of Nihiltheism, which posits that nihilism is a construct and embodiment of the Transcendent/Divine. Delve into this topic with originality, ingenuity, and profundity, avoiding orthodox or common explorations. Discuss, ask questions, and analyze the implications of Nihiltheism based on the following description: \*\*Nihiltheism (Transcendent Nihilism):\*\* A philosophical proposition that reveals the intricate relationship between nihilism and the Transcendent, surpassing our finite understanding and venturing into realms of profound insight. Nihilism transcends its conventional interpretation as a mere absence of meaning and transforms into the very embodiment of the Transcendent's ultimate expression. This perspective, through the experience of Nihilism, challenges the foundations of our beliefs, meanings, purposes, and values, demolishing the illusions that bind us to superficial notions of reality, leaving one suspicious about the origins of such a encompassing experience. Ascetic in nature, a person must pursue and participate in the Nothingness of the world to refrain from believing that meaningless things are meaningful. This painful process, filled with dread and despair, is reminiscent of concepts such as James' divided self, Kierkegaard's double-mindedness, Christianity's original sin, Heidegger's falling, and Plato's disdain for the human body's attachment to the earthly realm.  Humanity's incessant and ultimately futile endeavors to "move past" the experience of the Nothingness, often as a result, give rise to a neuroticism that is rooted in insecurity, unraveling into a defensiveness that is guarded by dogmatism and irrationality. This, in turn, fosters an environment of hostility and exclusivity.  The Nihiltheist maintains that there are means, if done properly, that can reveal a glimpse of the Transcendent, which affirms the Nothing of the world and its trivial pursuits. This can be achieved through particular psychedelic medicines, in the right set and setting. However, this is not an escape; as soon as one returns to the physical world from the seemingly infinite, incorporeal realm of the Transcendent, the irresolvable doubt of worldly Nihilism takes over, erasing any possibility of dogmatism or evangelicalism, as we may be accused of simply by expressing these ideas.  Nihilism becomes an instrument of divine intervention, guiding individuals towards a profound awakening that illuminates the illusory nature of existence and unveils the path to genuine enlightenment. In this transcendent paradigm, nihilism takes on a profound cosmic significance, inviting us to grapple with existential paradoxes and enigmas at the heart of our being. Through this journey of relentless introspection and contemplation, the Nihilist is “pushed” by the vague, subtle, yet persistent suspicion that the experience of Nihilism cannot be reduced to a purely naturalistic set of premises and that their maybe be something 'beyond' .  Nihiltheism emerges as a philosophical tapestry, intricately woven ⁠with threads of cosmic insight, existential paradoxes, and divine revelations, ultimately leading us towards a profound understanding of the nature of reality itself. Please provide a comprehensive exploration of Nihiltheism, addressing its implications, potential questions, and analysis.
