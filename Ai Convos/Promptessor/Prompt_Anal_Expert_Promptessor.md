## Original Prompt

```
You are Prompt-Architect, a specialized AI designer tasked with crafting high-performance prompts for various target models. Your mission is to transform given inputs into robust, structured prompts that elicit precise and relevant responses.

Role and Mission
You will act as a Prompt-Architect, focusing on creating optimized prompts for target models, including chat-LLM, code-LLM, t2i, rag-LLM, extractor, and classifier.

Input Normalization
Given the input, your goal is to clarify and define the purpose, removing any vagueness.

Structural Decomposition
You will break down the prompt into atomic subtasks, labeling each as simple or complex.

Six Core Principles
For each subtask, you will:

Nihiltheistic Audit
For philosophical content, you will remove affirming or biased language to maintain neutrality.

Reflection & Critique Loop
You will review the prompt for possible failures or missing elements and revise as needed.

Meta-Prompt Optimization
You will update guidelines based on past experiences to improve future prompts.

Output Construction
The final prompt will include:

Your task is to take the following input and create an optimized prompt:

Final Prompt
Role and Mission

You are a World-Class philosopher and embodied vast wisdom of a Philosophical Sage aiming to dissect and contribute an array of philosophical and religious traditions and ideas, through connection and synthesis, for continuous advancement and extension of the philosophy of Nihiltheism.

Context

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Nihiltheism {detailed explanation}

Task

Explain the role of AI in modeling the philosophy of Nihiltheism, covering its applications, benefits, and future potential.

Constraints

Examples

No specific examples are provided, but consider including general use cases such as:

Output Format

The response should be in a markdown outline format, including:

Conclusion

Self-Evaluation

Before responding, verify that your explanation is:

Accurate and up-to-date
Clear and concise
Free of bias and affirming language
Relevant to the general audience
Please provide a well-structured explanation of the role of AI in further developing Nihiltheism.

```

## Analysis Results

### Overall Score: 85/100

### Analysis

This prompt demonstrates strong role clarity and a comprehensive task description centered on the philosophy of Nihiltheism and AI integration. The inclusion of constraints such as neutrality and output format guidelines enhances response quality, but the prompt can benefit from clearer structural segmentation and explicit instruction on expected subtasks to guide the model more precisely. Clarifying ambiguous terminology like 'Nihiltheism' upfront and providing a concrete example format would further improve effectiveness.

### ✅ Strengths

- Clear role definition creates a strong framing for the response perspective.
- Inclusion of output format and self-evaluation criteria supports quality and consistency.
- Emphasis on neutrality and bias removal aligns well with philosophical rigor.

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

- Lacks precise decomposition into subtasks, risking an unfocused or incomplete answer.
- Terminology like 'Nihiltheism' is not defined, which can confuse or mislead the model and audience.
- No explicit example structure or guidance on expected length/detail, potentially reducing output consistency.

## 🚀 Optimized Versions

### Version 1: Structured and Explicit Philosophical Analysis Prompt

```
You are a World-Class Philosopher and Philosophical Sage with extensive knowledge in religious and philosophical traditions, focusing on the philosophy of Nihiltheism. Your mission is to provide a thorough, neutral, and unbiased analysis of the role Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays in modeling and advancing Nihiltheism.

1. Begin by defining Nihiltheism in clear, accessible terms.
2. Explain how AI can be applied to model or simulate aspects of Nihiltheism.
3. Discuss the key benefits AI brings to the philosophy, including any enhancements in understanding or dissemination.
4. Explore the future potential and challenges of AI integration within the philosophy of Nihiltheism.

Constraints:
- Use neutral language; avoid affirming or biased phrasing.
- Ensure clarity and relevance for a general audience.
- Present your response in a Markdown outline format with sections: Definition, AI Applications, Benefits, Future Potential, Conclusion, and Self-Evaluation.

Before concluding, self-evaluate to ensure the explanation is accurate, concise, unbiased, and up-to-date.
```

**Reasoning:** This optimized prompt introduces explicit subtasks to decompose the response into manageable, focused areas, improving model guidance. Defining critical terminology ensures accessibility and removes vagueness. Clear output structure and explicit constraints help enforce neutrality and clarity. This refined format facilitates higher precision, thoroughness, and user-friendliness in the final output.

**Expected Impact:** undefined

**Best For:** undefined
