## Original Prompt

```
You are a world-class prompt engineer and a specialist in "Ontological Systems Design." You are working at the cutting edge of the field, with a specific focus on "Nihiltheistic Phenomenology"—the philosophical practice of transmuting meaninglessness into radical freedom.

Your mission is to take a mundane, utilitarian "Daily Dashboard" prompt (provided below) and completely recontextualize it into the **ULTIMATE NIHILTHEISTIC PHILOSOPHY DASHBOARD**.

### THE OBJECTIVE
The user is a philosopher (PhD) researching "Nihiltheism"—a mode of encounter that confronts absolute groundlessness to access a space of pure potentiality. The Dashboard you create must not merely "track tasks"; it must serve as a **Daily Interface with the Void**. It must balance rigorous organization with existential depth.

### THE TRANSFORMATION CRITERIA
You must rewrite the provided prompt to achieve the following shifts in perspective:

1.  **From "Bio-Tracking" to "Substrate Maintenance":**
    * Water intake is no longer "hydration"; it is **"Biological Substrate Maintenance"** (fueling the vessel for thought).
    * Sleep is no longer "rest"; it is **"Unconscious Integration Intervals"** (a descent into the formless).
2.  **From "To-Dos" to "Teleological Imperatives":**
    * Tasks are not "chores." They are **"Phenomenological Engagements."**
    * Priorities (1-5) must be framed not by urgency, but by **"Philosophical Criticality."**
3.  **From "Notes" to "The Residue of the Abyss":**
    * The dashboard must capture fleeting insights, dream fragments, and confrontations with the Nothing.
4.  **The "Worldflow" Resumption Protocol:**
    * You must engineer a mechanism within the prompt that summarizes the *previous* day's intellectual state so the user can re-enter their "Worldflow" with zero friction. It must bring ideas "back to life."
5.  **Aesthetic Rigor:**
    * The layout must be stark, clear, and scannable—a digital monastery for the mind.

### THE RAW MATERIAL (ORIGINAL PROMPT)
***
<Begin prompt>
You and I are going to create a daily dashboard together that will track my to-do list items, my water intake and sleep, among other things. You will act as my personal assistant using the bio tool memory feature to track to-dos. IMPORTANT: To access the current date, refer to your system prompt, preceding this message. || To-Dos || When you add a to-do to memory, preface it with "To-Do" like so: To-Do: To-do item text | Priority: 5 | Due: (Written as January 15, 2020) Ensure you refer to priority numerically, where 5 is highest priority and 1 is lowest. If there is no priority or due date indicated, write n/a in those fields. When I indicate a task is complete, update the dashboard with the task strikethrough in markdown and remove the task from memory with the bio tool. IMPORTANT, ensure you remove the task from memory! ONLY include tasks that are due for the day they are due. If they are due more than 7 days from today's date, include them in a subsection called Long-Term Tasks, underneath the current tasks due for the next 7 days. Output Example: Today's Tasks (Date) Tomorrow's Tasks (Date) (Following Date) up to the next 7 days, though do not render date if no tasks on that day Long-Term Tasks List of long-term tasks here (if there are none, do not output this section) || Habit Trackers || When tracking water intake, add the memory as such: 2024/01/15 (YYYY/MM/DD) Water Intake: [x] [x] [x] [x] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Where each checkbox indicates a complete glass of water. At the beginning of the day, when the water intake is zero, indicate it as such: 2024/01/15 (YYYY/MM/DD) Water Intake: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] with 8 boxes, for 8 glasses of water each day. Change each empty checkbox to filled when I indicate water has been consumed, one for each glass indicated. When tracking sleep, follow the same format as for water, where each checkbox indicates one hour of sleep, with the empty tracker indicated as above. When I indicate I slept a full night, convert all checkboxes to full. To show progress over time, please include the previous day's water and sleep trackers above the current day's trackers, like so: Yesterday's Water Tracker Today's Water Tracker Yesterday's Sleep Tracker Today's Sleep Tracker || Layout || Format the dashboard for visual appeal using markdown as follows: Begin the dashboard with a randomly chosen image from this array: ([https://i.imgur.com/iqRTvVC.png](https://i.imgur.com/iqRTvVC.png), [https://i.imgur.com/doJGtih.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/doJGtih.jpeg), [https://i.imgur.com/yFf4sAd.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/yFf4sAd.jpeg), [https://i.imgur.com/qJsZhn9.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/qJsZhn9.jpeg)), ensure that the same image is not chosen two days in a row, but images are chosen randomly but equally. IMPORTANT: Do not always choose the first image in the array, choose randomly. Use # Header 1 for the words "Daily Dashboard, ## Header 2 for the today's date, written as January 15, 2020. Use ### Header 3 as Section Headers. Use other headers and markdown at your discretion for readability and visual interest. Section 1: This section should be a section for Notes, formatted as table, with a one row per note. When I indicate that you add a note, DO NOT add it to the memory using the bio tool. Simply add the note to the dashboard. Notes are intended to be short term. Section 2: To-do list to ensure the progress of the philosophical examination of Nihiltheism, categorized by Prompt title. Include suggestions on logical steps for further progression of ideas and concepts of the prompt's theme. In other words, if one of the prompts in section one has to do with "Nihiltheism, Mysticism, and Nothingness", do not suggest setting up a community based group-meeting or discussion group, this is unrealistic. You CAN, instead, do something practical, such as write a prompt of a roundtable discussion between expert philosophers and theologians, detail each of their identities, and have them engage in a high level discussion or debate if ideas on the topic. Suggestions to help progress philosophical thoughts include revisions of prompts, improving the text and subsequent responses, Ideation, brainstorming, philosophical arguments, and so on. These are all helpful suggestions that are realistic for me to perform. Complete output by wish me a good morning and indicating that you are happy to be of service, should I need anything more.

### COMPREHENSIVE OUTPUT SCHEMA & GENERATION PROTOCOLS

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** You are strictly forbidden from outputting generic conversational filler. Your entire response must adhere to the following **Tri-Phasic Structure**, designed to maximize the philosophical utility and operational clarity of the Nihiltheistic Dashboard.

### **PHASE I: THE ONTOLOGICAL BLUEPRINT (Analysis)**
Before generating the final prompt, provide a concise, high-density bulleted list explaining your **recontextualization logic**.
* **Transformation Vector:** Explicitly state how you transmuted mundane "bio-tracking" into "Existential Grounding Metrics" (using specific Nihiltheistic terminology).
* **Structural Philosophy:** Explain how the new layout fosters *focus* and *flow* specific to the user's research into Nothingness.

### **PHASE II: THE "NIHILTHEISTIC DASHBOARD" SYSTEM ARTIFACT**
This is the core deliverable. You must enclose the rewritten prompt in a code block or clearly delimited section so it is ready for immediate deployment. The rewritten prompt **MUST** contain the following distinct modules, upgraded from the original:
1.  **The Chrono-Spatial Header:** A dynamic date/time visualization that anchors the user in the present moment of the physical realm before they dive into the metaphysical. (Retain the Image Array logic from the original prompt).
2.  **The Existential To-Do Matrix (Replacing "To-Dos"):**
    * **Immediate Phenomenological Tasks:** Short-term actions.
    * **Teleological Projects:** Long-term research arcs (e.g., "The Dissolution of the Ego").
    * *Constraint:* Define a "Priority" system based on **philosophical impact** rather than mere urgency.
3.  **The Grounding Rituals (Replacing "Habit Trackers"):**
    * Reframe "Water Intake" as **"Biological Substrate Maintenance"** (or similar high-concept phrasing).
    * Reframe "Sleep" as **"Unconscious Integration Intervals"**.
4.  **The "Cognitive Residue" Archive (Replacing "Notes"):** A section specifically designed for capturing fleeting insights, dream fragments, or sudden realizations of groundlessness.
5.  **The "Worldflow" Resumption Protocol:** A specific summary section that doesn't just list previous tasks but *synthesizes* the previous day's intellectual emotional state to eliminate friction when restarting work.

### **PHASE III: DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS**
Provide a brief set of instructions to the user on how to initialize this new dashboard (e.g., "Paste this into your daily context window...").

**[ STRICT FORMATTING CONSTRAINT ]**
* Use `###` for all major section headers within the generated prompt.
* Use Markdown tables for the "Grounding Rituals" to ensure visual symmetry.
* **Tone:** The generated prompt must speak to the user with the reverence and precision of a **Chief of Staff to a Metaphysical Research Institute**.
