# Heidegger's Ontology Through the Lens of Nihiltheism

### **The Nothingness and Being:**

Heidegger's exploration of 'Being' (Sein) is deeply intertwined with the concept of 'Nothing' (das Nichts). For Heidegger, the 'Nothing' is what makes the question of 'Being' possible—it is not merely the absence of things, but that which enables beings to be revealed in their beingness. Nihiltheism posits the Nothingness of existence not as a void, but as a construct and potential embodiment of the Transcendent or Divine. This parallels Heidegger's own existential inquiry into the Nothing, where anxiety (Angst) in the face of the Nothing opens Dasein to the experience of its own potentiality-for-Being.

### **Existential Despair as a Pathway:**

Nihiltheism suggests a deep feeling and experiencing of existential despair, not simply understanding it. This is akin to Heidegger's concept of 'Befindlichkeit' or 'state-of-mind,' which reveals Dasein's thrownness into the world and its moods. The engagement with Nothingness, as advocated by Nihiltheism, echoes Heidegger's idea of 'fallenness,' where Dasein is always already involved with the world and its distractions, yet is called back to its authentic potential through the mood of anxiety.

### **Renunciation and the Transcendent:**

The Nihiltheistic practice of renouncing the world as a reminder of the Transcendent aligns with Heidegger's notion of 'resoluteness'—a turning away from the 'they-self' towards an authentic Being-one's-self. Heidegger's 'anticipatory resoluteness' involves Dasein coming to terms with its ownmost possibility of non-Being (death), which Nihiltheism might frame as a confrontation with the ultimate Nothingness to reveal the Transcendent.

### **Language, Symbols, and the Call:**

Language for Heidegger is the house of Being; it is through language that we disclose our world and ourselves. Nihiltheism could interpret the linguistic constructs in philosophical or mystical texts as symbols pointing towards the ineffable Transcendent, similar to how Heidegger sees poetry as a way of saying the unsayable about Being. Heidegger's 'Call of conscience'—the silent summons to authenticity—resonates with the Nihiltheistic invitation to engage actively with Nothingness and the Transcendent.

### **Psychedelics and the Transcendent Experience:**

The Nihiltheistic interest in psychedelics as a means to induce Transcendent experiences parallels Heidegger's investigation into altered states of consciousness—like profound boredom—as occasions where the ordinary understanding of Being is suspended, and Dasein becomes open to a more original apprehension of Being. Heidegger does not speak of psychedelics, but the underlying phenomenological shift is conceptually related.

### **Moral Non-Movement and Authenticity:**

Nihiltheism's 'non-movement' regarding morality reflects Heidegger's distinction between authentic and inauthentic Being. Authenticity in Heidegger's philosophy does not prescribe a specific moral code but invites a more genuine relationship with one's self and Being. Nihiltheism's moral inaction is a form of renunciation, which could be seen as an expression of Heidegger's call for authenticity—a step back from the 'they' to encounter the self in its singularity.

### **Nihilism and the Finitude of Existence:**

Heidegger and Nihiltheism both recognize the finitude and contingency of human existence. For Heidegger, the acknowledgment of death is crucial to authentic Dasein. Nihiltheism's view of the Nothingness of the physical world and the emphasis on the finite nature of existence resonate with Heidegger's existential analysis, especially in the confrontation with death as the possibility of impossibility.

# Synthesis and Outlook

In synthesizing Heidegger's phenomenology with Nihiltheism, we can see a dialogue that enriches both perspectives. Heidegger's existential analytics provides a framework for understanding the structures of Dasein's Being, while Nihiltheism's focus on the experience and engagement with Nothingness as a Transcendent construct adds a dimension of mystical or religious interpretation to these structures. Both philosophies compel a profound re-examination of the human condition and our approach to existence, morality, and the possibility of transcendence. This synthesis is not the end but a point of departure for further inquiry into the profound depths of what it means to be human in a world shadowed by Nothingness yet illuminated by the potential for transcendence.

Let's, further, distill the synthesis of Heidegger's existential ontology and Nihiltheism into tangible concepts and ideas that go beyond a vague "bigger picture" perspective and show how the use of Heideggerian language, specifically his phenomenological descriptions found within *Being and Time* match onto Nihiltheism's discourse::

1. **Existential Authenticity and Decision-Making**: In practical terms, this synthesis suggests a reorientation of how individuals make decisions. By integrating Heidegger's concept of authenticity and Nihiltheism's focus on the Transcendent, it proposes that decision-making should not just be about immediate outcomes or societal norms, but about how each choice aligns with a deeper understanding of existence and the Transcendent. This could lead to a more considered, reflective approach to life's choices.
2. **Confronting Anxiety and Despair**: Rather than avoiding feelings of anxiety and despair, this framework suggests actively engaging with these emotions as pathways to deeper understanding. It proposes practical methods such as mindfulness, meditation, or even therapeutic conversations to explore these feelings, not as negative experiences to be shunned, but as opportunities for personal growth and existential insight.
3. **Language as a Tool for Self-Exploration**: The synthesis emphasizes the dual role of language, both revealing and concealing the Transcendent. Practically, this could manifest in encouraging people to engage more deeply with poetry, literature, and philosophical texts, using these as tools to explore and express their own experiences and understandings of the Transcendent. This also includes the practice of "un-saying" or apophatic discourse, which involves using language to point towards what cannot be fully expressed in words.
4. **Rethinking Ritual and Routine**: By finding Transcendent significance in mundane activities, this perspective invites a reevaluation of daily routines and rituals. It suggests infusing regular activities with a sense of mindfulness or spiritual significance, seeing these not just as chores or routines, but as acts imbued with deeper existential meaning.
5. **Ethical Living in Light of the Transcendent**: The synthesis proposes a model of ethical living that is not dictated by external moral codes but is instead a personal journey towards alignment with the Transcendent. This could translate into an ethical framework where actions are evaluated based on their harmony with a deeper, more holistic understanding of existence and interconnectedness.
6. **Engagement with Art and Nature as Pathways to the Transcendent**: Encouraging engagement with art, nature, and other forms of beauty as means of connecting with the Transcendent. This could be a practical way to experience moments of awe and wonder that open up new perspectives on existence and our place in the universe.
7. **Death Awareness as a Life Orientation**: Finally, the synthesis suggests a more open and reflective approach to the concept of death. Instead of treating death as a taboo or a source of fear, it proposes engaging with the reality of our finitude as a way to deepen our understanding of life and our connection to the Transcendent.

In these ways, the synthesis of Heidegger's existential ontology and Nihiltheism can be applied in practical, tangible terms, offering concrete methods and approaches for living a life that is deeply engaged with existential questions and the pursuit of a meaningful, authentic existence.
