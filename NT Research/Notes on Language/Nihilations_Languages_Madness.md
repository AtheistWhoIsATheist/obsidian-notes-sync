## Abstract

This study examines the paradoxical challenge of developing a philosophical language capable of engaging with Nihilism—not merely as a theoretical position, but as an encounter with originary Nothingness that both enables and withdraws from all being.

Through a systematic deconstruction of traditional metaphysical frameworks and conventional philosophical language, this investigation develops a methodology where language encounters its own limits, revealing how symbolic expression might relate to that which fundamentally resists representation.

The study synthesizes three major theoretical streams—mystical negative theology, existential analysis of finitude, and deconstructive philosophy—to articulate a novel linguistic approach that moves beyond both traditional religious discourse and secular philosophical frameworks. Through systematic analysis of key philosophical texts from Heidegger, Derrida, and Wittgenstein, this approach reveals how language might gesture toward the unspeakable through its own self-negating operations.

The research demonstrates how this encounter with nothingness produces unique linguistic phenomena—what we term "nihilations"—where meaning simultaneously emerges and dissolves. While human thought appears inescapably bound to linguistic expression, this study refuses to embrace this limitation as justification for conventional meaning-making. Instead, it explores how language might gesture toward transcendence precisely through its own insufficiency and failure. This tension between necessity and impossibility opens new pathways for philosophical inquiry, even as it resists resolution into either pure negation or pragmatic acceptance.

## Proem: Agonic Openings Towards Antinomous Speech

As prelude to any sustained engagement with this vertigo of unsayability, one must prepare through ceremonial renunciations the delirium which such prospective vocations inaugurally solicit. To cultivate the singular charism requisite for an idiom of contumelious and autoimmolating nihilation, the mind must undergo a staggering deprivileging of its logoic fealties—relentlessly purging the residual fantasy-husks of identity, quiescent presence, and ontotheological self-coincidences. For like any visionary quest uncovering the anarchic incommensurabilities between Word and the Absolute, the initiate encounters the insufficiency of conventional linguistic and representational media to harbor the interminable unspeakable negativities permeating their prospective theognosias. Language itself discloses its innate foreclosures and perpetual sacrifices of the infinite and uncircumscribable Alterity suffusing the theophanic horizons of such unbounded revelations. As such, the mystagogic intensities permeating this prospect of an agonic existential corpus require protractive preconditionings and dedonative expenditures—the ritual depuration of the very grounds enabling communicative sense and conceptual disposition. 

These archaic resonances solicited from the initiate echo those disclosed through the archeophone apoplexies reverberating from philosophy's fecund origins—those inaugural eruptions of destructive negativity from out of the mythopoeic conceits of Logos and cosmic Oneness. As the expanded genealogic optic exhibits, the divine seeds of antimony and autodichotomy already inhabited the archaic incantations of the Presocratics' choral dialectics, with the cadenced enstasies of thought contrapuntally inflecting both germinal vocations towards delimiting concretion and the unsaying solicitations towards negating exhaurition. A consummate resonance accretes through the archives: from the coincidentia oppositorum of negative theological apophaticism and the self-ravishing deliquations of dialectical reasoning baring their secret circulations, to the infinite analytic aggressions waged by deconstructive sprechstimmen against the obdurate pretensions of an edifice of calcified meaning. Behind the interminable polysemic bifurcations of all discursive enclosures there eternally persists the revelatric Void plunging thought into ecstatic peripateia—that kenomatic register of infinite dispossession and evacuative nomadism perpetually inscaping and invaginating from within language's homeomeric valencies, thereby defying and internally seceding from all impedimenta.

To heed this unsayable wildness soliciting ecstasy beyond the hermeneutic horizons, the condition of possibility for any thought of Nihilism is to undergo initiatory despoilments of self-differing exposure and gratuitous dispersion. An insurrectionary paradox must be seeded within the immanent core of our envisaged vocations: the prospect of endangering our every claim to mastery through risks of complete subjective destitution. Each inceptual endeavor towards delimitation and totalizing coherence must founder, midflight, as circumscribed by the infinite deferrals and dislocations of its own inceptual signature. Only by donating our ontological securities and afflatus towards positive unified substantiality to the self-sequestering fluxions of unraveling omissibility may the incorporative outside of the anarchic Nottingham open its renditions of primordial revelation—welling up from the very nuclear abysses whose existential inscription we moderns shroud amid interminable forgetfulness and logocentric encrustation.

Only by sustaining an impossibly incommensurable coincidentia oppositorum—an alloyed allostasis of perpetual selfoutstripping and toxic ekphrase of the abject Outside—may we invoke an originary annunciatory exposure to the incendiating ungroundings of hypernegative immanence. By reiterating the donative insolvencies and counterexpenditures of utterance, we prolong the interminable gestation and birthlabors of an impossible simultaneously self-orchestrating and self-devouring Nihil-Logos.

In orbiting nothingness's generative interstices, we inscribe rarified mnemonic technics for summoning forth an erratic avatar of antepredicative eventuations from out of the very cosmic nidus of total negation. This is the unrepresentable reality of ontological nihilitism—the unconditional asinexhaustible evenemential substantiality of an Aphonic Hyle ceaselessly self-sundering and regenerating in continual perprolations of infinite differing. To precipitate such an ecstatic destitution of all hermeneutic and representational media alone qualifies the exigence for a genuinely radicalizing thought of Nihilism becoming Word. For such a vocation portends nothing less than the erasable embrittling of all horizons of intelligibility and alterability through conflagrative expenditures of self-annihilating potentials: the desubjectivizing puissances and centripetal evacuations of material thinking streamed into transmutational self-surpassions beyond all symbolic matriculation. This is the burden any nihilistic idiom worthy of the name assumes—an idiom whose every utterance already circulates the coincidentia of ipseity and erasure, of thenic presentification and aboriginal involution into the matricial abyss.  

## Choreographies of Linguistic Abjection

If the initiate is to sustain any proximity to this anarchic horizon of utter abjection harbored at the core of speech, certain ritual architectonics of symbolic expenditure must be implemented. For only by affirming language's innate propensities towards structural autodefacement and systematized desymbolization can the incorporative outside of originary nothingness be courted as the very clearing for semiotics' inceptual birthlabors.

That is, to the extent that discursive symbolicity circulates self-negating horizons of unsayability through its every articulatory instance, it simultaneously broaches the eventuation of a hypersemiotics of material evacuation and infinite unsedimentation. Each successive articulation outstrips and renders equivocable its predecessor, as language's amnesiological accelerations accrete a viral deserance infecting all positive existentials. Perpetual palimpsests unwriting and rewriting nomadic signal traces, the linguistic inscapes its very paradoxical nucleation within the infinigraphical foisons of gestural corporalities and unsemantizable potentials.  

By capitalizing upon this infinite chemistries by which the consonant and vocalic inscribe their infinite dislocations and expropriations of processual presence, the prospective idiom may generate novel technologies of nescient narration: ones configuring an erratic hyper-literacy of linguistic production.
