“In particular, that in the face of which one has anxiety is not encountered as something definite with which one can concern oneself; the threatening does not come from what is ready-to-hand or present-at-hand, but rather from the fact that neither of these ‘says’ anything any longer. Environmental entities no longer have any involvement. The world in which I exist has sunk into insignificance; and the world which is thus disclosed is one in which entities can be freed only in the character of having no involvement. Anxiety is anxious in the face of the “nothing” of the world; but this does not mean that in anxiety we experience something like the absence of what is present-at-hand within-the-world. The present-at-hand must be encountered in just such a way that it does not have any involvement whatsoever, but can show itself in an empty mercilessness.” 68b  
  
  
“Anxiety discloses the insignificance of the world; and this insignificance reveals the nullity of that with which one can concern oneself—or, in other words, the impossibility of projecting oneself upon a potentiality-for-Being which belongs to existence and which is founded primarily upon one’s objects of concern.”  
  
  
“That in the face of which one is anxious is completely indefinite. Not only does this indefiniteness leave factically undecided which entity within-the-world is  
threatening us, but it also tells us that entities within-the-world are not ‘relevant’ at all.”  
  
  
“The utter insignificance which makes itself known in the ‘nothing and nowhere’, does not signify that the world is absent, but tells us that entities within-the-world are of so little importance in themselves that on the basis of this insignificance of what is within-the-world, the world in its worldhood is all that still obtrudes itself.”  
  
  
“The question is there in a spell of boredom, when we are equally distant from despair and joy, but when the stubborn ordinariness of beings lays open a wasteland in which it makes no difference to us whether beings are or are  
not—and then, in a distinctive form, the question resonates once again: Why are there beings at all instead of nothing?”  
  
  
“In dread, being as a whole becomes untenable.”  
  
  
“That existence is pervaded by nihilating behavior attests to the permanent and indeed obscured manifestness of no-thing that dread originally discloses. But this means original dread is suppressed for the most part in existence. Dread is there. It’s only napping. Its breath permanently trembles in existence, only slightly in the apprehensive, and inaudibly in the “Uh húh!” and “Húh uh!” of those who are busy; best of all in the reserved, surest of all at the heart of  
existence that is daring. But this happens only in those for whom it expends itself in order to preserve the ultimate greatness of existence.”  
  
  
“The beholdenness of existence to no-thing on the basis of hidden dread is the surmounting of being as a whole, transcendence.”  
  
  
“As surely as we never get a sure grasp of the generality of be-ing in itself, just assurely do we all the same find ourselves somehow placed in the midst of the generality of bare be-ing. In the end, there continues to be \[besteht\]an essential difference between getting a grasp of the whole of be-ing in itself and finding oneself in the midst of be-ing as a whole. The former is impossible in principle. The latter happens all the time in our existence. Of course, it looks just as though in our everyday comings and goings we were holding fast to only just this or that \[kind of\] be-ing, as though we were lost in this or that realm of be-ing. But no matter how fragmented the daily round may seem, it always maintains be-ing in the unity of a “whole,” although only in the shadows. Even then and precisely just then, when we are not especially busy with things, this “as a whole” overcomes us; for example, in genuine boredom. This is a long way off far off when this or that book or play, job or leisure activity, is boring. It breaks out when “it’s boring.” Profound boredom, like a silent fog insinuating itself in the depths of existence, pulls things, others and oneself into it altogether with remarkable indifference. Such boredom reveals be-ing as a whole.”  
  
  
“Idle talk and ambiguity, having seen everything, having understood everything, develop the supposition that Dasein’s disclosedness, which is so  
available and so prevalent, can guarantee to Dasein that all the possibilities of its Being will be secure, genuine, and full. Through the self-certainty and decidedness of the “they”, it gets spread abroad increasingly that there is no need of authentic understanding or the state-of-mind that goes with it. The supposition of the “they” that one is leading and sustaining a full and genuine ‘life’, brings Dasein a tranquillity, for which everything is ‘in the best of order’ and all doors are open. Falling Being-in-the-world, which tempts itself, is at the same time tranquillizing However, this tranquillity in inauthentic Being does not seduce one into stagnation and inactivity, but drives one into uninhibited ‘hustle’ \[“Betriebs”\]. Being-fallen into the ‘world’ does not now somehow come to rest. The tempting tranquillization aggravates the falling.”  
  
  
  

“Dasein plunges out of itself into itself, into the groundlessness and nullity of inauthentic everydayness. But this plunge remains hidden from Dasein by the way things have been publicly interpreted, so much so, indeed, that it gets interpreted as a way of ‘ascending’ and ‘living concretely’.”  
  
  
  
“Everydayness forces its way into the urgency of concern, and divests itself of the fetters of a weary ‘inactive thinking about death’. Death is deferred to ‘sometime later’, and this is done by invoking the so-called ‘general opinion’ \[“allgemeine Ermessen”\]. Thus the “they” covers up what is peculiar in death’s certainty—that it is possible at any moment.”  
  
  
  

“By this time we can see phenomenally what falling, as fleeing, flees in the face of. It does not flee in the face of entities within-the-world; these are precisely  
what it flees towards—as entities alongside which our concern, lost in the “they”, can dwell in tranquillized familiarity. When in falling we flee into the “at-home” of publicness, we flee in the face of the “not-at-home”; that is, we flee in the face of the uncanniness which lies in Dasein…”  
  
  
  
  
“Original dread can awaken in existence at any moment. It does not need wakening by an unaccustomed eventuality for that. The depth of its sway corresponds to the scarcity of its possible occasioning. It is permanently on the verge and yet only seldom comes into play to hold us in suspense. The beholdenness of existence to no-thing on the basis of hidden dread makes man the placeholder of no-thing. We are so finite that we are not even able to bring ourselves face to face with no-thing by our own will and resolve. So deeply is mortality buried in our existence that it denies our freedom its very own and deepest finiteness.” (rare nature of Nihilism, ‘difficult’ to be ‘in’ Nihilism for extended periods of time)  
  
  
  

“Human existence can relate to being only if it is itself beholden to no-thing. Going above and beyond be-ing is of the essence of existence.”  
  
  
  
“Perhaps it strikes only once, like the muffling tolling of a bell that resounds into Dasein and gradually fades away.”  
“The only question is whether we are willing to fall victim to this cheap look of things and thus take the whole matter as settled, or whether we are capable of experiencing a provocative happening in this recoil of the why-question back upon itself.”  
  
  
  
“On the other hand, if such faith does not continually expose itself to the possibility of unfaith, it is not faith but a convenience.” (put this in a section tied to religion or faith, e.g. ‘naturalism’ or ‘philosophy’)  
  
  
“…philosophy is always the direct concern of the few. Which few? The ones who transform creatively, who unsettle things.”  
Heidegger  
  
  
“But—according to its essence, philosophy never makes things easier, but only more difficult. And it does so not just incidentally, not just because its manner of communication seems strange or even deranged to everyday understanding.”  
  
  
  

“Does such being attuned in which no-thing itself is brought before us happen in human existence?”  
Buber- “The language in which this is accomplished is what it says: anxiety- the stirring of the creature between the realms of plantlike security and spiritual risk.”  
  
  
Buber- “The eternal You is You by its very nature; only our nature forces us to draw it into the It-world and It-speech.”

No one has anything to say. Listen to a person speak, you can learn a lot more from silence.  
  
  
A language developed to help distinguish and navigate between the experience of the Nothing of the word which lays the groundwork for not only a ‘pushing’ through the Nothingness (instead of a ‘cure’ for the human condition) into its Transcendental forms. Why do these feelings/emotions/experience show up? Is the ‘cure’ purely something natural? Or is there a ‘Call’ from within, yet beyond? Instead of fleeing from anxiety, despair, etc. a language that details a description of the human condition and continually asks ‘Why?’ in regards to their existence in the first place. Does this language allow for a deeper separation from tradition, culture, everydayness? Does it help one navigate authentically through some of the most terrifying experiences and feelings that humans are capable of?  
  
  
  
I want there for be a language that allows for a bridge between the Diminished and the Augmented forms of Nihilism. How does one do this? The Augmented experience of Nihilism is beyond language. Is t he language simply taking the place of the rituals, ceremonies, dogmas, etc. of the traditional religions?  
  
  
Shouldn’t the language of Nihilism act as a ‘map’ through the Nothing of the world? Should it lend itself to the Transcendent aspect of Nihilism? Can it lend itself? Is this language a tool? Beneficial (whatever that word means)? Is there a way to navigate without making claims to ‘truth’? Is this language simply ‘walking’ through the experience by only asking the question ‘Why?’ over and over and over? Does that negate any notion of ‘doctrine’? The language must be tentative. The language must be replete with doubt, rather than ‘confirmations’.  
  
  
Isn’t the priority of this language to allow someone to work their way to Transcendence or, maybe more so, to help prepare oneself for Transcendence?  
  
  
What does this language have to do with quietism, if anything? Does it have anything to do with solitude? It seems that it must if there is ‘idle talk’.  
“…there are no words really to explain these things. The words will always fall short of the reality.” Therese of Lisieux  
  
  
What is this ‘language’ we seek to develop? Is it a path the demands the taking of one’s life? Is it a consolation to the reality of existence? Is there is purpose to create such a thing? Is it a waste? Is anything not a waste?  
  
  
Nothing is not a negation of God, but an affirmation of the Other.
