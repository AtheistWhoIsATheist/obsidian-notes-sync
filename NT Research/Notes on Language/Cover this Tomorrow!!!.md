## HARPA

“_The text criticizes both philosophy and religion. If these are not adequate languages to express the experience of nihilism, what kind of language should we invent?”_

### Inadequacy of Philosophy and Religion

The text criticizes both philosophy and religion as inadequate languages to express the experience of nihilism. Philosophy, as defined, lacks authoritative prescriptions and is concerned with logical consequences rather than ontology. Religion, on the other hand, is based on the experience of ordinary people and lacks conviction. Both fail to provide a complete and satisfactory language for nihilistic experience.

### The Need for a New Language

Given the inadequacy of philosophy and religion, the text suggests the need to invent a new language to express the experience of nihilism. This language should be grounded in direct human experience and not be based on myth, tradition, or empirical facts. It should be symbolic, self-critical, and open to re-interpretation. The text proposes the term "Nihiltheism" to describe this new genre of human experience.

### Characteristics of the New Language

The new language should be able to navigate the complexities of nihilism in both its forms - the nothingness of the world and its transcendence. It can draw inspiration from Heidegger's comprehensive language about the human condition, which includes concepts such as anxiety, everydayness, authenticity, and resoluteness. However, it should not be considered complete or literal, but rather a symbolic language that captures key insights into the human condition.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the text suggests that a new language needs to be invented to express the experience of nihilism. This language should go beyond the limitations of philosophy and religion and be grounded in direct human experience. It should be symbolic, self-critical, and open to re-interpretation, allowing for a better understanding of the ineffable nature of nihilism.
