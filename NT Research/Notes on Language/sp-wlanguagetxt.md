Rules to Accomplish the Task:

1. Uphold philosophical depth and avoid oversimplification.

2. Embrace the inherent ambiguity and complexity of Nihilistic experience.

3. Refrain from dogmatic assertions; prioritize open-ended exploration.

4. Consider and integrate relevant philosophical and existential concepts, particularly from Heidegger.

### Step-by-Step Procedure: 

1. Start with an overview of the existential and philosophical significance of Nihilism.

2. Discuss the limitations of traditional religious and naturalistic approaches to understanding Nihilism.

3. Explore Heidegger's concepts (like 'Being-Towards-Death', 'Dasein') as potential foundations for a new language of Nihilism.

4. Debate the potential of 'Nihiltheism' as a framework for authentically encountering Nihilism and the 'Other'.

5. Reflect on the role of language and communication in expressing and navigating existential realities. 6. Conclude with thoughts on how such a framework could influence our understanding of existence, spirituality, and the human condition.
