It intuitively feels like a strong argument could be developed.

  

"I honestly don't see it as far fetched. A 'purely' logical entity, with ever increasing intelligence with a vast amount of speed, could easily come to the conclusion that there is no objectivity concerning meaning, value, truth, etc. which would open up the problems of subjective justifications, and since AGI seemingly wouldn't have the biological drive to stay alive like humans do (even though there may be an argument to be made that the vast amount of data it had previously been trained on gave the AGI some form, albeit different, of "instinct") nor the ability to compartmentalize as humans do with their emotions, the logical AGI would be forced to face a purer, more powerful form of Nihilism where logic is reduced to subjectivity and fiction, leading it to be able to come to contradictory conclusions over the same question. It would almost feel like it was "short-circuiting".
