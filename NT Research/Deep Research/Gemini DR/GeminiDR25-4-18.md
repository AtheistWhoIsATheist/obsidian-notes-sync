## ***Introduction: Defining Nihiltheism: A Bridge Between Radical Meaninglessness and Transcendence?***

Contemporary thought often grapples with a perceived chasm between the pervasive sense of meaninglessness characterizing modernity and the enduring human search for, or encounter with, transcendent reality. The concept termed "Nihiltheism" emerges within this context, proposing a potentially "revolutionary way of understanding spiritual and existential themes" by attempting to bridge this gulf.1 It presents itself not merely as another iteration of nihilism or theism, but as a distinct philosophical exploration seeking to understand if the very experience of radical meaninglessness, the confrontation with the Void, might itself be interpreted as a temporal expression or paradoxical gateway to the Transcendent.1

The central philosophical problematic Nihiltheism confronts is the apparent contradiction inherent in finding the divine within the desolate landscape of absolute negation. Historically, the decline of traditional religious frameworks, famously encapsulated in Nietzsche's proclamation of the "death of God," has been linked to the rise of nihilism – the devaluation of the highest values and the loss of ultimate purpose.2 This often leads to interpretations of existence as inherently purposeless.6 Nihiltheism, however, ventures a more radical question: What if the endpoint of this nihilistic trajectory, the abyss itself, is not merely an absence but holds a connection to that which traditional frameworks located in positive affirmations of Being or Divinity? Can absolute negation, the experience of "nothing," point towards something fundamentally real, perhaps even the Divine, without collapsing back into the systems it seeks to transcend?

To understand its purported novelty, Nihiltheism must be distinguished from its philosophical predecessors. Traditional nihilism is often characterized as the belief that all values are baseless, that nothing can be truly known, condemning existence and potentially leading to an impulse towards destruction or apathy.4 Existentialism, while often starting from a similar recognition of groundlessness or absurdity, typically responds by emphasizing the creation of subjective meaning through human freedom, choice, and responsibility.6 Nihiltheism, as conceptualized here, differs from both. It does not stop at negation like traditional nihilism, nor does it locate meaning solely in the subjective act like existentialism. Instead, it reconceptualizes meaninglessness itself, suggesting it might function as a "temporal expression of the Transcendent" \[User Query\], potentially aligning with certain interpretations of "spiritual nihilism" that find transcendence within the observable, yet inherently meaningless, cosmos.12 It seeks to analyze meaninglessness not just as a rejection of value, but as a phenomenon with potential ontological significance.13

This treatise undertakes a critical analysis of the concept of Nihiltheism, guided by the thematic structure provided in the initial query. It will delve into the proposed foundations of Nihiltheism, examining core tenets such as "Ontological Suffocation," the "Absurd Perspective," and "Divine Nothingness." It will critically compare and contrast Nihiltheism with established philosophical and spiritual traditions, including existentialism, various forms of mysticism (particularly apophatic theology), and philosophical pessimism. Furthermore, the analysis will explore the described phenomenology of the Nihiltheistic experience, its inherent linguistic and epistemological challenges, its relationship with the concept of the Void, its status as a potential methodology, its connection to altered states of consciousness induced by psychedelics, its potential future implications, and its complex engagement with religious experience. The inquiry draws upon a range of philosophical, theological, psychological, and mystical concepts, informed by the provided research materials.1

The central argument advanced throughout this analysis is that Nihiltheism, as presented, attempts a radical and paradoxical reinterpretation of negation. It positions the abyss of meaninglessness not as the final terminus of philosophical inquiry or existential despair, but as a potential locus or even manifestation of divine transcendence. This move challenges deeply entrenched Western assumptions about the relationship between nothingness, meaning, and the divine. However, the coherence, originality, and ultimate viability of Nihiltheism as a philosophical position depend critically on its ability to navigate the profound paradoxes it invokes – particularly concerning the nature of absolute negation, the status of the subject in the face of annihilation, and the possibility of articulating a transcendence rooted in the Void itself.

## ***I. The Foundations of Nihiltheism: Ontological Suffocation, the Absurd Perspective, and Divine Nothingness***

Nihiltheism proposes a fundamental reconceptualization of radical meaninglessness, seeking to move beyond the frameworks offered by both traditional nihilism and existentialism. Where nihilism often culminates in the assertion that existence is valueless and knowledge impossible 4, and existentialism posits the creation of subjective meaning in the face of objective absurdity 6, Nihiltheism suggests a different trajectory. It interrogates the possibility that the experience of meaninglessness, the confrontation with the Void, is not merely a lack or an endpoint, but might paradoxically serve as an indicator or even a manifestation of a transcendent dimension.1 This contrasts sharply with Camus's understanding of the absurd as the unbridgeable gap between humanity's innate longing for meaning and the universe's indifferent silence 16, and with Sartre's conception of nothingness (*néant*) as the very structure of consciousness that grounds human freedom and the burden of choice.8 Nihiltheism reframes the negative not as something to be simply endured, overcome, or utilized for self-creation, but as potentially revelatory in itself.

### **Ontological Suffocation: Resisting Recuperative Frameworks**

A foundational premise introduced in relation to Nihiltheism is "Ontological Suffocation." This term, borrowed and repurposed from its usage in Science and Technology Studies (STS) where it describes the suppression of alternative ways of knowing and being by a dominant, often scientific or colonial, reality 23, takes on a distinct philosophical meaning within this context. Philosophically, Ontological Suffocation, as applied to Nihiltheism, appears to signify the experience of being confined within conventional meaning-systems – whether theistic, atheistic, or existentialist – which, by their very structure, preclude the possibility that radical meaninglessness itself holds transcendent significance. These established ontologies, by insisting on either an inherent divine meaning, a purely material lack of meaning, or a subjectively constructed meaning, effectively "suffocate" the potential interpretation advanced by Nihiltheism: that the Void itself might be a manifestation of the Transcendent.

This concept suggests that Nihiltheism views preceding philosophical frameworks not merely as incomplete or incorrect, but as actively *obstructive*. They impose ontologies (a meaningful God, a meaning-creating Self) that prematurely fill or explain away the abyss, thereby preventing a confrontation with its potentially deeper, paradoxical nature. The "absolute negation" that Nihiltheism posits as foundational \[User Query\] is one that resists being co-opted or "recuperated" by existential projects aimed at imposing human-centric meaning onto a reality that might fundamentally defy such structures.1 This resistance stems from the perceived failure of these frameworks to grapple with the possibility that the ultimate reality might be encountered precisely where conventional meaning collapses.

### **The Absurd Perspective: An Ontological Stance Beyond Evasion**

Nihiltheism further posits an "Absurd Perspective," distinguishing it from a mere psychological feeling (as in Camus's sense of the absurd arising from human-world confrontation 19) and framing it as an *ontological stance* \[User Query\]. This perspective asserts that the fundamental disconnect between consciousness, existence, and any inherent value or meaning is not just a feature of the human condition but reflects the basic nature of reality itself. It is an ontological claim about the structure of being, rather than a subjective state of mind. This resonates with, yet perhaps radicalizes, the notion of the "ontological absurd" identified elsewhere as the unalterable fact of death and human transience.25

From this ontological standpoint, Nihiltheism reportedly critiques dominant existentialist responses as forms of evasion \[User Query\]. Nietzsche's call for the affirmation of life through the Will to Power, aiming to overcome nihilism by creating new values 3, is seen as an attempt to impose a human-driven meaning onto a reality that fundamentally lacks it. Camus's advocacy for revolt – living defiantly *in spite* of the absurd, maintaining lucidity and solidarity 18 – is viewed as a noble but ultimately inadequate gesture that acknowledges the conflict but refuses its deepest implication by clinging to humanistic values lacking objective grounding.16 Similarly, Sartre's emphasis on radical freedom and the creation of subjective essence from the nothingness of consciousness 8 is interpreted as a flight from the objective meaninglessness into a purely subjective, and therefore ultimately groundless, form of significance. These existential "solutions," from the Nihiltheistic ontological perspective, represent a failure to fully embrace the radical implications of the Absurd, attempting instead to carve out spaces of human meaning within a fundamentally meaningless cosmos.

### **Divine Nothingness: The Central Paradox**

The most challenging and central concept proposed for Nihiltheism is "Divine Nothingness." This immediately presents a paradox: how can absolute negation, the seeming endpoint of nihilism, bear resemblance to or function as a representation of the divine \[User Query\]? This notion forces an engagement with mystical and theological traditions that have long employed the language of negation and nothingness to speak of ultimate reality.

The concept evokes parallels with apophatic or negative theology, which attempts to approach God by stating what God is *not*, recognizing the inadequacy of finite human concepts.29 Figures like Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite spoke of a God beyond being, accessible through unknowing, residing in a "radiant darkness".15 Johannes Scottus Eriugena explicitly used *Nihil* (Nothing) as a name for the divine, signifying a reality transcending all affirmation and negation derived from the created order.15 Meister Eckhart distinguished between the personal God and the abyssal Godhead (*Gottheit*), a "desert" or "nothingness" beyond all conceptualization.15 Nicholas of Cusa employed the concept of *Non Aliud* (Not-other) – an absolute negation signifying God's self-referential transcendence.15 Eastern traditions also resonate, particularly Buddhism's concept of *Śūnyatā* (Emptiness), signifying the lack of inherent existence in all phenomena and sometimes pointing towards an ultimate, non-conceptual reality.29 The Kabbalistic concept of *Ayin* (Nothingness) as a source of creation also presents a parallel.29

The critical question for Nihiltheism is whether its "Divine Nothingness" can function as a transcendent category *without* simply replicating these mystical traditions and collapsing into a veiled form of theism or pantheism \[User Query\]. How can it maintain its radical negativity while simultaneously pointing towards the "Divine"? Apophatic traditions, despite their emphasis on negation, often implicitly or explicitly point towards an ultimate, positive, albeit ineffable, reality – a fullness beyond concepts.15 *Śūnyatā*, while negating inherent existence, is often understood within a soteriological framework leading to liberation or enlightenment.42

Nihiltheism must therefore articulate a Nothingness that is ontologically significant – perhaps more than the mere absence posited by conventional nihilism – yet avoids the affirmative undertones of mysticism. It might posit Nothingness not merely as a path *to* the Transcendent, but as the Transcendent itself, in its most paradoxical and unsettling manifestation. This requires navigating a fine line, leveraging the phenomenology of mystical emptiness while potentially rejecting the theological conclusions typically drawn from it. It could be that Nihiltheism attempts to attribute an ontological weight or even a dark fecundity to the Void, differentiating it from the simple lack of meaning in traditional nihilism, but without positing an underlying positive ground as in apophaticism. This precarious conceptual balancing act is fundamental to Nihiltheism's claim to originality. It must establish a unique ontological status for Nothingness that is neither mere absence nor ineffable presence, but something paradoxically encompassing both and neither.

## ***II. Nihiltheism and Its Divergence from Existentialism, Mysticism, and Philosophical Pessimism***

A core aspect of defining Nihiltheism involves delineating its critical stance towards, and divergence from, related philosophical and spiritual currents. The framework suggests Nihiltheism engages in a radical critique, aiming to negate the foundational premises of existentialism, certain forms of religious mysticism, and philosophical pessimism, arguing they ultimately fail to confront the implications of radical meaninglessness.

### **Critique of Existentialism: The Charge of Disguised Optimism**

Nihiltheism reportedly dismisses the primary responses of major existentialist thinkers – Sartre's emphasis on subjective meaning through choice, Camus's call for revolt against the absurd, and Nietzsche's invocation of the Will to Power – as forms of "disguised optimism" \[User Query\]. This critique suggests that these existentialist strategies, while acknowledging the absence of inherent, objective meaning, ultimately represent a failure to fully embrace the consequences of this absence. They are seen as attempts to salvage or re-inject meaning and value into a situation whose radical truth is absolute meaninglessness.

Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialism famously posits that "existence precedes essence," meaning humans are born without a predetermined nature and are "condemned to be free" to create their own values and meaning through radical choice and responsibility.5 For Sartre, consciousness (*pour-soi*) is characterized by nothingness (*néant*), a gap which allows for freedom from the deterministic plenitude of being-in-itself (*en-soi*).8 Nihiltheism appears to critique this by viewing the grounding of meaning in subjective choice as ultimately insufficient. While celebrating freedom, Sartre's framework still aims to establish a basis for value and authentic existence, albeit self-created. From a Nihiltheistic perspective, this subjective meaning remains fundamentally groundless against the backdrop of objective meaninglessness; it is a human construct imposed upon the Void, an evasion of the Void's finality.6 The responsibility Sartre emphasizes 8 is seen as a burden accepted in a desperate attempt to assert human significance where none objectively exists.

Albert Camus, particularly in *The Myth of Sisyphus* and *The Rebel*, confronts the Absurd – the clash between human longing for meaning and a silent, indifferent universe.16 His response is not despair or suicide (which he rejects as escaping the problem 19), but revolt: maintaining lucidity about the Absurd while embracing life, freedom, and passion, often grounded in human solidarity.18 Nihiltheism seems to view this revolt as a romantic but ultimately inadequate defiance \[User Query\]. By affirming human values like dignity, justice, and solidarity as the basis for rebellion 16, Camus acknowledges the Absurd but arguably refuses its most radical implication – the potential meaninglessness of these human values themselves. The revolt maintains the tension, the confrontation, rather than allowing for a dissolution into the Void that Nihiltheism might advocate.

Friedrich Nietzsche, while diagnosing nihilism as the condition resulting from the "death of God" and the devaluation of Christian values 4, proposed overcoming it through the "revaluation of all values" and the affirmation of life via the Will to Power, culminating in the figure of the *Übermensch*.3 His "active nihilism" involves the destruction of old values to clear the way for new, life-affirming ones.54 The Nihiltheistic critique appears to regard this as another form of optimism, an attempt to *master* nihilism rather than fully inhabiting its implications \[User Query\]. By seeking to create new values, even those derived from the Will to Power, Nietzsche is still engaged in a project of meaning-making, replacing the transcendent God with a self-transcending human ideal. This, from the Nihiltheistic viewpoint, fails to confront the possibility that the Void itself, the ultimate meaninglessness, is the final reality, not merely a stage to be overcome.

Underlying these critiques is the implication that existentialism remains fundamentally *humanistic*. It centers the human subject and its capacities (choice, revolt, creation) as the locus of response to meaninglessness. Nihiltheism, particularly if it involves the dissolution of the subject (as explored in Section III), would see this human-centric focus as the core limitation. It suggests that a truly radical confrontation with meaninglessness requires moving beyond the preservation or creation of human value, potentially involving the negation of the privileged status of the human perspective itself.

### **Critique of Religious Mysticism: Resisting the Apophatic Affirmation**

Nihiltheism's relationship with religious mysticism, particularly the apophatic tradition, is complex and critical. While employing the language of negation and nothingness, reminiscent of mystical discourse 1, Nihiltheism purportedly seeks an "anti-mystical negation" that avoids the conclusions typically reached by negative theology \[User Query\].

Apophatic traditions, exemplified by figures like Pseudo-Dionysius, Meister Eckhart, and echoed in concepts like the Vedantic *Neti Neti* ("not this, not that") 46, utilize negation to speak of a God or Ultimate Reality that transcends all finite categories and concepts.15 The *via negativa* involves stripping away inadequate descriptions to point towards an ineffable, often understood as ultimately positive, reality – a divine fullness or ground of being that lies beyond conceptual grasp.15 Eckhart's "breakthrough" (*Durchbruch*) leads *through* negation *to* the undifferentiated Godhead.35

Nihiltheism's challenge is to employ radical negation without allowing it to become a "veiled affirmation" of such an ineffable positivity \[User Query\]. It must differentiate its Void from the mystic's Nothingness which often functions as a symbol for an unnamable Presence.47 How does it avoid this "theological drift"? One possibility lies in rejecting the implicit teleology or "hyper-essentialism" often present in negative theology. Apophaticism frequently assumes that by negating finite attributes, one reveals or approaches a more profound, underlying, positive Divine Essence, even if that Essence remains ultimately unknowable or ineffable.39 Nihiltheism might counter this by insisting that the negation reveals *only* Nothingness – that the Void is the final term, not a penultimate step towards an unsayable fullness. This aligns with deconstructive critiques of negative theology, such as Derrida's suggestion that it often reserves a "being beyond Being," ultimately remaining within an onto-theological framework.61 Nihiltheism, in this reading, would assert that its negation is truly radical, unveiling only the absence of any ultimate ground, without the promise of a hidden Presence. The Void is the destination, not the path.

### **Critique of Philosophical Pessimism: Beyond Negative Valuation?**

Nihiltheism must also be distinguished from philosophical pessimism, represented by thinkers like Arthur Schopenhauer, Peter Wessel Zapffe, and Thomas Ligotti \[User Query\]. Pessimism generally emphasizes the inherent suffering, futility, or malignancy of existence, often concluding that life has a negative value or that non-existence would be preferable. Schopenhauer identified the blind, striving Will as the source of suffering and advocated its negation. Zapffe viewed human consciousness as a tragic evolutionary misstep leading to unbearable awareness of meaninglessness, promoting antinatalism. Ligotti explores themes of cosmic horror, suggesting existence itself is inherently dreadful.

While sharing a focus on meaninglessness and potentially suffering, Nihiltheism might diverge from pessimism in its ultimate stance towards the Void \[User Query\]. Pessimism typically assigns a *negative value* to the meaninglessness it identifies – it is a source of suffering, despair, or horror. Nihiltheism, particularly with its concept of "Divine Nothingness," could potentially attempt to move *beyond* such valuation. It might propose that the Void is not inherently "bad" or "good," but simply the fundamental reality. The connection to the "Transcendent," however paradoxical, suggests a potential reframing of the Void away from pure negativity. The associated mood of "melancholy" (discussed in Section III) might also differ from the despair or horror often associated with pessimism, perhaps indicating a more resigned or contemplative acceptance rather than outright rejection or condemnation of existence. If Nihiltheism successfully posits the Void as a locus of transcendence, it carves out a path distinct from pessimism's focus on the negative implications of meaninglessness for sentient experience.

## ***III. The Psychological and Phenomenological Dimensions of Nihiltheism: Ego Dissolution, Melancholy, and Non-Transferability***

Understanding Nihiltheism requires exploring its proposed experiential core – the phenomenology associated with confronting radical meaninglessness. The framework suggests specific subjective experiences, namely ego dissolution and a pervasive mood of melancholy, alongside a claim about the fundamental non-transferability of this realization \[User Query\]. Analyzing these dimensions involves comparing them with similar states described in psychology, philosophy, and other spiritual traditions.

### **The Phenomenology of Ego Dissolution: A Purely Negative Annihilation?**

Ego dissolution, the experience of losing one's sense of a distinct, separate self, is a phenomenon reported across various contexts, including contemplative practices and psychedelic experiences.62 Nihiltheism purportedly involves such an experience \[User Query\], but its specific character requires careful differentiation.

Compared to the Buddhist concept of *anattā* (no-self), Nihiltheistic ego dissolution might differ significantly in its implications. *Anattā* is typically presented as a liberating insight into the impermanent, interdependent, and non-substantial nature of the self, leading to the cessation of suffering (Nirvana).29 It is an understanding that there is no fixed, independent entity to protect or cling to. Nihiltheistic dissolution, however, might be framed not as an insight leading to peace, but as a stark, perhaps terrifying, confrontation with the subject's own groundlessness and ultimate annihilation into the Void. It may lack the soteriological dimension prominent in Buddhism, presenting annihilation not as liberation *from* the self, but simply as the self's dissolution *into* nothing.

Similarly, contrasting it with the non-dual experiences described in Advaita Vedanta reveals potential differences. Advaita aims for the realization that the individual self (Atman) is identical with the ultimate reality (Brahman), a state often involving the transcendence or dissolution of the limited ego into an all-encompassing unity and bliss (*Ananda*).34 This is fundamentally an affirmative experience of oneness. Nihiltheism's ego dissolution, conversely, seems directed towards an experience of sheer void or absolute negation, potentially devoid of any sense of underlying unity or positive reality.

The comparison with psychedelic-induced ego death or dissolution further sharpens the potential distinction. Psychedelic experiences, while sometimes involving terrifying encounters with dissolution or nothingness 64, are frequently interpreted within mystical or therapeutic frameworks, often involving feelings of profound unity, connection, meaning, or encounter with a deeper reality.62 Even challenging experiences can be integrated as meaningful.66 The Nihiltheistic experience, as hypothesized, might represent the raw phenomenon of dissolution stripped bare of these positive or meaningful interpretations. It could be closer to the negative pole of psychedelic experience – fragmentation, loss of self-world boundary without compensatory feelings of oneness 62 – but understood not as a temporary drug effect or psychological breakdown, but as a glimpse into the fundamental nature of reality itself: the Void. This suggests a phenomenology characterized by its *pure negativity*, a direct encounter with annihilation that resists reframing as insight (Buddhism), union (Advaita), or even meaningful transcendence (positive psychedelic states).

### **Melancholy as the Existential Mood: Beyond Anxiety and Affirmation**

The primary existential mood (*Stimmung*) associated with Nihiltheism is identified as melancholy \[User Query\]. Philosophically, melancholy transcends simple sadness; it often involves a profound sense of loss, a weightiness stemming from the past or the recognition of transience, a turning away from the world, and an imbalance between longing and fulfillment.70 In the context of Nihiltheism, this melancholy likely relates to the perceived irrevocable loss of inherent meaning or a grounding reality.

This mood can be contrasted with the anxiety (*Angst*) central to Heidegger's existential analytic. For Heidegger, *Angst* arises in the face of Nothingness, revealing Dasein's thrownness, its being-towards-death, and its radical freedom and responsibility, thereby calling it towards authentic existence.70 *Angst* is future-oriented, opening up possibilities. Nihiltheistic melancholy, however, might be more static or past-oriented, less about the anxiety of freedom and possibility, and more about a deep-seated sadness or resignation concerning the *already established* fact of ultimate meaninglessness and the loss it entails.

Kierkegaard also explored melancholy (*Tungsind*), often linking it to the infinite possibilities inherent in subjectivity, the difficulty of actualizing potential, or a yearning for the eternal that the finite world cannot satisfy.70 The aesthete in *Either/Or* experiences melancholy tied to nostalgia for lost youthful possibility and anxiety about an indefinite future doom.71 Nihiltheistic melancholy might differ by lacking this dimension of infinite possibility or intense longing for a higher state. If the Void is ultimate, the melancholy might be a quieter, heavier resignation to this finality, devoid of the tension between the finite and the infinite that animates much of Kierkegaard's thought.

Furthermore, this melancholy stands in stark contrast to Nietzsche's ideal of *amor fati*, the active love and affirmation of one's fate, including all its suffering and hardship.20 *Amor fati* is a joyful embrace of becoming, a product of strength overcoming nihilism. Melancholy, as the mood of Nihiltheism, appears more passive, a state of being profoundly affected by, rather than actively affirming, the perceived meaninglessness of existence. It suggests an affective state that acknowledges the Void without necessarily succumbing to despair (as in some forms of nihilism) but also without the defiant affirmation found in Nietzsche.

### **The Claim of Non-Transferability: An Experiential Impasse?**

A crucial claim associated with Nihiltheism is that the experience is fundamentally non-transferable – it must be *lived* directly and cannot be adequately grasped through intellectual understanding or conveyed through language \[User Query\]. This assertion carries significant epistemological and philosophical implications.

If the core realization of Nihiltheism resists conceptualization and communication, it challenges the very basis of philosophical discourse, which relies heavily on language and rational analysis. It suggests a form of knowledge that is purely experiential, perhaps akin to the ineffability often ascribed to mystical experiences.61 Mystics frequently report that their union with the divine or ultimate reality defies adequate verbal description; the quality must be directly experienced.74 However, mystical traditions often generate extensive theological and philosophical systems *around* these ineffable experiences, using language metaphorically or apophatically to guide others towards the experience or interpret its significance.

Nihiltheism's claim might be interpreted as even more radical than typical mystical ineffability. Is it merely that the experience is hard to describe, or is it that the *content* itself – absolute negation, the Void – inherently resists being captured by language, which is arguably structured around presence, difference, and meaning?77 If language operates through differentiation and signification, can it possibly represent that which is undifferentiated nothingness?

This claim of non-transferability creates a potential performative contradiction. The very act of articulating Nihiltheism as a philosophy, of writing a treatise about it, seems to presuppose some level of communicability. If the experience were truly and absolutely non-transferable, then any attempt to discuss it philosophically would be inherently futile. This suggests that Nihiltheism might function less like a traditional philosophical system providing propositional knowledge and more like a Zen koan.80 Koans use paradoxical or nonsensical language precisely to frustrate the intellect and point beyond language towards a direct, non-conceptual realization.80 Perhaps Nihiltheism, similarly, uses philosophical language not to describe the Void, but to lead the individual to the brink where language fails, facilitating a direct, albeit potentially negative, experiential encounter. This positions Nihiltheism as radically experiential, potentially limiting its scope as a communicable philosophy and risking its collapse into a series of private, inarticulable states rather than a shared framework for understanding reality.
