# Research Plan: Stages of Ego Death and Re-integration

## 1. Objectives
    *   Identify and describe distinct stages or phases commonly associated with "ego death" experiences.
    *   Focus on the sequence from initial resistance through dissolution, experience of non-self/unity/void, to re-integration of a (potentially transformed) self.
    *   Draw upon sources from psychology (especially transpersonal), psychedelic research, and mystical traditions.
    *   Connect these stages to relevant categories in the `typology_abyssal_encounters_v1.md` report.
    *   Leverage insights from all existing research files for broader context.

## 2. Key Questions
    *   What are the typical prodromal signs or initial phases leading to ego dissolution (e.g., anxiety, resistance)?
    *   How is the fragmentation or dissolution of self-constructs phenomenologically described?
    *   What role does surrender play in the process?
    *   What are the characteristics of the peak experience of non-self, unity, or void during ego death?
    *   How is the re-integration or re-emergence of a sense of self described? Is this new self typically transformed, and if so, how?
    *   Are there common models or maps of these stages in psychedelic research (e.g., Grof's work) or mystical literature (e.g., stages of contemplative practice)?
    *   How do these stages relate to, for example, "The Dissolving Void: Ego Death and Transcendent Unity" or "The Kenotic Void" categories from the typology?

## 3. Expected Deliverables
    *   A structured report titled `ego_death_sequences_v1.md` containing:
        *   An introduction to the concept of ego death and its experiential stages.
        *   A description of the identified stages/phases, with phenomenological details for each.
        *   Examples and supporting evidence from psychology, psychedelic research, and mystical traditions.
        *   Discussion of how these stages connect to the previously developed typology of abyssal encounters.
        *   A brief conclusion.
        *   Sources.

## 4. Workflow Selection
    *   Primary focus: Search-focused, with significant synthesis.
    *   Justification: This task requires gathering information on dynamic experiential processes from diverse fields and synthesizing it into a sequential model, linking it to prior typological work.

## 5. Initial Steps
    *   **Step 1 (COMPLETED):** Create this research plan and save it to `/workspace/docs/research_plan_ego_death_stages.md`.
    *   **Step 2:** Review the four specified existing research files (`/workspace/data/typology_abyssal_encounters_v1.md`, `/workspace/data/cross_traditional_ontology_insights_from_input_files.md`, `/workspace/data/groundless_ground_concepts_research.md`, `/workspace/data/creative_abyss_research.md`) to extract any explicit or implicit descriptions of stages related to ego death or profound self-transformation. Pay particular attention to the "Dissolving Void" category in the typology report.
    *   **Step 3:** Conduct targeted web searches for terms like:
        *   "stages of ego death"
        *   "ego dissolution process"
        *   "psychedelic therapy stages self-loss"
        *   "Grof model ego death"
        *   "mystical stages self-transcendence"
        *   "identity collapse re-integration psychology"
        *   "phenomenology of ego loss and rebirth"
        *   "ayahuasca experience stages"
        *   "psilocybin ego death phases"
        *   "dark night of the soul transformation stages" (as it can involve ego struggles)
    *   **Step 4:** Extract full content from relevant search results.
    *   **Step 5:** Analyze extracted content and the existing research files to identify common sequences, stage models, and phenomenological markers for each stage.
    *   **Step 6:** Develop a synthesized model of the stages of identity collapse and re-integration.
    *   **Step 7:** For each stage, describe its characteristics and provide examples, explicitly linking to the typology where appropriate.
    *   **Step 8:** Draft the report `ego_death_sequences_v1.md`.
    *   **Step 9:** Review and refine the report.
    *   **Step 10:** Call `task_done`.
