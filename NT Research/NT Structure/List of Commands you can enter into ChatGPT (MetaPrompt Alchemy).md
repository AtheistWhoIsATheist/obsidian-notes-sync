List of Commands you can enter into ChatGPT (MetaPrompt Alchemy)

  

LONG STORY SHORT: Copy the list of commands - ChatGPT will recognize the prompt as context for an Intuitive-Dynamic command structures (Create new words)

  

For example , you could add a prompt command called /PhoenixPrompt - This prompt rebirths itself like a Phoenix... Heads-up is that ChatGPT can do multi-commands but it can get iffy (I do about 3 at a time)

  

So what I'm doing is basically copying a list of commands as a prompt - and then having ChatGPT imagine up new commands --- give ChatGPT the whole prompt to enable the command interface (then customize it)
