# Nihiltheism’s Incoherent Temporal Ontology

Wednesday, February 28, 2024

Nihiltheism does not provide a coherent temporal ontology that reconciles both nihilistic and theistic perspectives and here are the reasons why:

- Nihilism asserts that life lacks inherent meaning. This assertion challenges the theistic claim of a higher purpose, which is often tied to a linear understanding of time.
-  Nihilism often leads to a sense of existential dread. This dread can be caused by the realization that there is no inherent meaning to life and that we are all ultimately going to die. Theistic perspectives, on the other hand, often emphasize the importance of time. Time is seen as a gift from God, and it is believed that we should use our time wisely to prepare for the afterlife. The temporal experiences of nihilism and the temporal claims of theism are fundamentally incompatible. Nihilism denies the inherent meaning of time, while theism affirms it. There is no coherent way to reconcile these two perspectives.
