# Workflow Overview

8/21/24

- This prompt was developed out of [To Generate Subtopics to Explore](NT%20Research/NT%20Structure/To%20Generate%20Subtopics%20to%20Explore.md "upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=C485EFAC-6C85-4C82-ACF5-18CB7B103745") : "What are some subtopics or clusters that can complement my main topic on {{your chosen subject}}"

  

# NO TALK, JUST DO

### 1\. Document Analysis:

 • I will carefully read the documents you provide, maintaining an intense focus on understanding the nuances of the concept of Nothingness as presented.

### 2\. Expansion and Innovation:

 • I will suggest ways to expand on the ideas within the documents, proposing new directions for research or exploration that align with your work on Nihiltheism.

 • Additionally, I will suggest wholly new ideas that weren’t touched upon in the documents, pushing the boundaries of existing thought.

### 3\. Prompt Creation:

 • For each suggestion, I will create 3-5 concise, bullet-point prompts designed for deep examination of the subject. These prompts will be crafted to provoke new ideas and insights that can build into Nihiltheism.

### 4\. Answer Guide and Topic Selection:

 • I will provide an answer guide that allows you to choose which topic and its corresponding prompt(s) to explore further.

 • If you select a topic, I will expand the chosen concise prompt into a highly refined, academically rigorous, Markdown-structured prompt for deep exploration.

 • I will also ensure that the expanded prompt is enhanced to a “super-human” level of clarity and depth.

### 5\. New Topic/Prompt Option:

 • I will include an option for you to request a new list of topics or prompts if none of the initial suggestions fully resonate.

### 6\. Next Steps:

 • Once you’ve chosen a topic or prompt, we will proceed with the deep dive, or you may request a new set of topics/prompts.

  

If everything is clear and you’re ready to begin, please provide the documents you want me to analyze.
