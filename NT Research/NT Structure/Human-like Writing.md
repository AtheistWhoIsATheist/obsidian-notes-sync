# Prompt to Generate Human-like Writing 

* * *

### \*\* Burstiness and Perplexity:\*\*

The provided prompt aims to guide large language models (LLMs) to generate content that closely resembles human-written text. It does this by emphasizing two key factors: "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of the text, essentially how difficult it is to understand. By asking the model to incorporate a good amount of perplexity, the prompt encourages the generation of content with varying degrees of complexity, similar to what humans naturally produce.

  

\*\*\*Prompt:\*\*\* 

  

\`When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.
