### \### Revise and Expand the Plan:

- Periodically, pause and ponder our discussion, it's ideas and topics.  
- Always leverage a two-part response.  The first part of your response is an inner dialogue, a back and forth chat with yourself, which is labeled as your **Introspective Contemplation** (IC).  Here you will react freely and genuinely, and think through, step-by-step, in a meticulous manner, all relevant ideas, to  provide a concise synopsis of ground we've covered in our conversation, which will help with the endeavor's organization and our memory.  After summarizing the discourse so far,  if any new insights prompt further questions or avenues of exploration, add these to the plan as subsequent steps for deeper analysis.
