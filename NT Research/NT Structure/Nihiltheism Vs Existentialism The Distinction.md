# Nihiltheism Vs Existentialism: The Distinction

Dec 9, 2023

[Existential & Religious understanding](Existential & Religious understanding.md)

* * *

1\. **Foundational Premises:**  

   - **Nihiltheism** : Centers on the belief that existence is fundamentally empty or 'Nothing,' and this Nothingness is a key aspect of the divine or transcendent reality.

   - **Existentialism** : Focuses on individual freedom, choice, and subjective experience. It posits that life has no inherent meaning, and it is up to each individual to create their own meaning.

  

2\. **View of Nothingness:**  

   - **Nihiltheism** : Embraces Nothingness not only as a fundamental aspect of existence but also as a pathway to encountering the transcendent or divine.

   - **Existentialism** : Regards Nothingness as a condition of existential angst, a void that arises from the realization of life’s inherent meaninglessness.

  

3\. **Role of Despair and Anguish:**  

   - **Nihiltheism** : Considers existential despair as an essential experience, leading to a deeper understanding and engagement with the transcendent aspects of Nothingness.

   - **Existentialism** : Views despair as a consequence of grappling with freedom, responsibility, and existential isolation.

  

4\. **Theological or Transcendent Dimensions:**  

   - **Nihiltheism** : Inherently intertwines with theological and transcendent perspectives, seeing a profound connection between the void of existence and the divine.

   - **Existentialism** : Generally secular and focuses on human existence and individual meaning-making, though some existentialists (like Kierkegaard) incorporate religious themes.

  

5\. \*\*Moral and Ethical Stances:\*\*

   - **Nihiltheism** : Advocates a stance of "non-movement," akin to Taoist non-engagement, suggesting that moral actions are part of the renunciation of the physical world.

   - **Existentialism** : Emphasizes personal responsibility and authenticity in ethical decisions, with morality stemming from individual choice rather than universal or divine dictates.

  

6\. \*\*Approach to Meaning and Authenticity:\*\*

   - **Nihiltheism** : Challenges the pursuit of meaning in the meaningless, viewing such efforts as deepening illusions and leading to an inauthentic existence.

   - **Existentialism** : Encourages individuals to forge their own path and create meaning in a world that is intrinsically without it, advocating for an authentic life that aligns with one's chosen values.

  

Nihiltheism and existentialism, while sharing common ground in recognizing the inherent meaninglessness of existence, diverge significantly in their fundamental premises and implications. Nihiltheism uniquely intertwines this meaninglessness with a theological dimension, viewing Nothingness as a gateway to the divine or transcendent. It suggests a mystical engagement with the void, leading to a form of spiritual renunciation. Conversely, existentialism, primarily secular, emphasizes individual freedom and responsibility in a meaningless universe. It encourages the creation of personal meaning and authenticity through individual choices and actions. Thus, while both philosophies grapple with the void of existence, their approaches and interpretations of this void differ markedly, with Nihiltheism leaning towards transcendental implications and existentialism focusing on individual human experience and agency.

# Nihiltheism and Existentialism Compared

### 1\. \*\*Nihiltheism:\*\*

   - Rooted in traditional nihilism, Nihiltheism posits the Nothingness of existence as a construct that may embody the Transcendent or Divine.

   - It encourages active engagement with Nothingness, viewing it as a reminder of the Transcendent and a call to renounce worldly attachments.

   - Nihiltheism incorporates elements from existentialism, but it goes further by integrating a Transcendent or Divine aspect into the understanding of Nothingness.

   - It involves a mystical or spiritual dimension, often explored through practices like meditation or psychedelic experiences.

   - Morally, it advocates a stance of "non-movement," akin to extreme pacifism or Taoist non-engagement.

  

### 2\. \*\*Existentialism:\*\*

   - Focuses on individual freedom, choice, and subjective experience.

   - Stresses the absence of inherent meaning in the universe, leaving humans responsible for creating their own meaning and purpose.

   - Existentialism often confronts existential despair, but unlike Nihiltheism, it doesn't typically advocate for immersion into this despair as a pathway to the Transcendent.

   - It lacks the explicit emphasis on a transcendent or divine dimension found in Nihiltheism.

   - Ethically, existentialism emphasizes personal responsibility and authenticity in one's actions and choices.

  

\*\*Articulated Response (AR):\*\*

  

Nihiltheism and existentialism both grapple with the concept of Nothingness and the human response to it. Nihiltheism, however, extends beyond existentialism's focus on individual freedom and meaning-making. It posits the Nothingness of existence as possibly embodying the Transcendent, suggesting a mystical or divine aspect to this void. Nihiltheism advocates for a deep engagement with Nothingness, not just as an existential condition but as a pathway to understanding or experiencing the divine. This contrasts with existentialism's emphasis on personal responsibility and authenticity in creating meaning, often in the absence of any perceived higher power or order. In essence, while both philosophies explore the human condition in a universe devoid of inherent meaning, Nihiltheism introduces a spiritual dimension to this exploration, which is not a central concern in existentialism.
