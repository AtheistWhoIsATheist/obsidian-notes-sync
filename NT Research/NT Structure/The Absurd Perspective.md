The **_"Absurd Perspective"_** is the idea that Nihilism recognizes the absence of values, and thus, all actions are ultimately reduced to absurdity, since humans are inherently compelled to make value judgments in a valueless universe.

- **_All human actions are driven by value judgments, but without inherent moral values, no non-arbitrary human action can be taken._** 
- With all possibilities deemed 'equivalent,' there is no right or wrong, up or down, and all possibilities collapse into meaninglessness. 
- Yet, humans continue to act in the world. [The Absurdity of Eternal Optimism:](The Absurdity of Eternal Optimism.md)
- This surrender to the Absurd Perspective is one possible response to the experience of Nihilism, which includes madness, suicide, and experiences of the Other.
