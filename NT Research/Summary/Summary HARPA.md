Nihiltheism, a philosophical concept that integrates elements of Nihilism with theistic perspectives, offers a rich field of inquiry for exploring the existential and metaphysical aspects of human experience. Let's delve into each of your proposed tasks to further unfold the layers of Nihiltheism.

1. **Historical and Philosophical Origins of Nihiltheism**:
    - Nihiltheism's roots can be traced through a lineage of philosophical thought that intertwines with Nihilism and theism. The concept draws on Nihilistic ideas, which emerged prominently in 19th-century Russia, emphasizing the lack of inherent meaning and value in existence. Simultaneously, it incorporates elements of theistic thought, exploring the possibility of a transcendent reality or divinity inherent in the Nothingness of existence. Key figures like Soren Kierkegaard, who grappled with the despair of existence and the leap of faith towards the divine, and Friedrich Nietzsche, with his proclamation of the death of God and the liberation of human potential, are crucial in this synthesis. The integration of Eastern philosophies, which often conceptualize Nothingness or emptiness as fundamental aspects of reality, also plays a significant role in shaping Nihiltheism.
2. **Time-Bound Existential Despair in Nihiltheism**:
    - Within Nihiltheism, existential despair is viewed as a temporal, yet profound, aspect of human existence. It transcends mere emotional turmoil, encapsulating a deep-seated recognition of life's inherent emptiness and the transient nature of human endeavors. This despair is not a defect to be cured but a fundamental experience that connects us with the stark reality of our existence, leading to a transformative engagement with Nothingness. It echoes the existential themes found in the works of thinkers like Martin Heidegger and William James, who explore the human condition as a constant negotiation between being and nothingness, presence and absence.
3. **Navigating 'Nothingness' and 'Existence'**:
    - The philosophical exploration of 'Nothingness' and 'Existence' has been a central theme throughout history. Ancient philosophers like Parmenides and later existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre have delved into this dichotomy. Sartre, particularly, in his "Being and Nothingness," investigates the tension between existence as a fact and the human craving for inherent meaning. This interplay offers critical insights for understanding Nihiltheism, which posits that the acknowledgment of Nothingness is not an end but a pathway to engaging with a higher transcendental reality.
4. **Interdisciplinary Approach to Nihiltheism**:
    - An interdisciplinary approach combining existential philosophy, theological perspectives, and empirical sciences offers a holistic view of Nihiltheism. This methodology allows for a multifaceted exploration of the concept, where existential philosophy provides a framework for understanding the human condition within the realm of Nothingness, theology introduces perspectives on the divine or transcendent aspect of Nothingness, and empirical sciences offer insights into the psychological and sociological dimensions of Nihiltheistic experiences.
5. **From Existential Terror to Transcendental Longing in Nihiltheism**:
    - Nihiltheism articulates a journey from existential terror, characterized by an acute awareness of life's futility, to a transcendental longing for something beyond the observable. This transformation involves embracing the terror of existence as a crucial step towards a deeper understanding or connection with a reality that transcends empirical understanding. It resonates with the mystical experiences described in various religious traditions, where despair and longing are often precursors to profound spiritual insights.
6. **Nihiltheism's Insights into the Human Condition**:
    - Nihiltheism offers innovative perspectives on the human existential dilemma, particularly in how it navigates the convergence of existential despair with transcendental hopes. It challenges traditional approaches to existential questions by suggesting that despair and the renunciation of worldly attachments can lead to a deeper engagement with the transcendental aspects of existence, thereby offering a unique lens through which to understand the human quest for significance.

In summary, Nihiltheism presents a nuanced and profound approach to understanding human existence. It challenges us to rethink traditional concepts of despair, meaning, and divinity, inviting a deeper engagement with the complexities of the human condition.
