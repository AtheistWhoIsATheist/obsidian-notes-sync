## The Preambles of A Philosophy of Transcendent Nothingness

Nihiltheism is a philosophy that embraces a traditional view of nihilism, along with the claim that the essential Nothingness of existence is seen as a construct, and possibly the embodiment of the Transcendent/Divine, i.e. 'God'. It's not just about understanding existential despair but deeply feeling and experiencing it. Nihiltheism encourages an active engagement with the Nothingness in our physical world, ascetic in nature, as a "reminder” of the Transcendent, and the process of renunciation of the world.

This philosophy connects with a wide range of philosophical and religious traditions, including existentialists like Soren Kierkegaard and Martin Heidegger, Christian mystics like Meister Eckhart and Miguel de Molinos, and Eastern philosophies like Buddhism, Vedanta, and Taoism, which all, in some way, accept or embrace a “Nothingness” to human existence.  Even figures like Emil Cioran and Paul Tillich, who may initially seem at odds with each other, share common ground under the lens of Nihiltheism.

  

## The Pursuit of and Participation with Temporal Nihility

Unlike philosophies offering ways to avoid existential despair, Nihiltheism suggests immersing oneself within it, while also acknowledging the impossibility of participating in this state of being for any extended period of time.  This is the same insight that is found throughout many thinkers in the history of philosophy and religion.  For example, William James’ “divided-self”,  Soren Kierkegaard’s “double-mindedness”, Martin Heidegger’s “always falling” into the they, Plato’s distain for the human body as it drags one, always, back down into the world and away from The Forms, Vivekananda’s fight of relinquishing of the ego, and even the “original sin” of Christianity.  Nihiltheism views the Nothingness of the physical world as an undeniable reality.
 
This all encompassing destroyer of worlds, this experiential realization of the complete lack of meaning, value, and purpose, including one's own subjectivity, reducing all human movement to absurdity. This experience of Nothingness has a clearing effect that leaves one alone, in deepest depths of anguish, despair, and doubt. And in this state, the resonance of a subtle, vague, yet persistent echo from what seen like both within and from beyond, pushing one to explore existential frameworks that possibly move) beyond the limitations of a purely naturalistic framework. This experience of worldly Nihilism, perceived as the meaninglessness within, or Nothingness of the world, pushes a questioning of whether such an 'all-encompassing' experience can be fully explained by a purely naturalistic framework, and wonders if it could signify something Divine.  


## The Transcendent: Encountering the Wholly Other

This is where psychedelics are noteworthy within Nihiltheism. Particular psychedelic medicines can trigger Transcendent experiences that align with its key tenets, such as an out of body release into an unimaginable, other-worldly, timeless realm, the death of the ego, a full renunciation of the human and any conception of the worldly, a oneness with everything, along with what can only be described as simultaneously both a _distinct encounter_ and a _complete oneness_ with an "Infinite Presence".  

When these entheogens are pursued 'properly', which include much philosophical contemplation, correct set and setting, along with a foundational intent to peak beyond the veil, possibly encountering the Infinite, will reveal an unimaginable realm of existence, that does, if nothing else, deepen the questioning of how a such an experience could be fully explained with wholly naturalistic worldview. 

The consequences of the entheogens, that are produced with an unimaginable force, reveal an incorporeal realm of Nothingness that can be described in a similar manner as many of those within the mystical traditions, as a “Full”or "Plentiful" Nothingness, Emptiness, or Void.  The experience is one that is _terrifyingly-beautiful_, completely other-worldly, yet leaves one perceiving this “space” as if one has been here before, a sense of familiarity, as if one has finally “come home", reminiscent of Plato's Theory of Recollection concerning the Eternal Forms. 


## The Return: Navigating the Tension 

While one may experience a fleeting connection to the Transcendent, an eventual retreat, from the recollective perception similar to Plato’s Forms, and a return to mundane reality and the Nothingness of the world, renewing our existential fears and doubts, consequently leaving one in the irresolvable state of pergatory, unable to make a leap from subjective illusion to affirming any objectivity to the experience.

Existing in the world for the Nihiltheist involves a state of being that is under constant reminder of life's fleeting nature and the physical world's insignificance. Morality is perceived uniquely in Nihiltheism, adopting a stance of "non-movement". In practice, this perspective may resemble mere pacifism or the Taoist philosophy of non-engagement with the world, often described as "doing nothing." 

However, in the extreme interpretation of moral values being considered nonexistent, Nihiltheism takes this moral inaction to its utmost extent.  The Nihiltheist does no harm, not in order to “do good” or “avoid evil”, but as a step in the renunciation of the physical world.


## Conclusion: The Nihiltheistic Paradox

Nihiltheism views any attempt to "move past" Nihilism as a desperate evasion of a seemingly fundamental existence, instead of a pursuit of, participation with, and a renunciation of the Nothingness of the world. There is a warning, or suggestion, that by trying to find meaning in the meaningless, by elevating the finite up to the equivalent of the Infinite, only deepens our illusions, allowing for the strength of an inauthentic state of being to reach delusory heights, disregarding the timeless insight of Plato of the crucial factor of examing existence, of philosophy, as a preparation for one’s inevitable death.

## **Transcendental Reflections on Nihiltheism: A Philosophical Odyssey into the Abyss of Nothingness**  

### **The Quintessence of Nihiltheism: Unveiling the Divine in Emptiness**  

Nihiltheism intricately weaves the fabric of traditional nihilistic perspective—life's inherent void—with a profound insight: this 'Nothingness' might be our portal to the Divine. Far from a mere cerebral endeavor, Nihiltheism demands a visceral, soul-stirring journey into existential despair. It beckons us to an ascetic embrace of the void that surrounds us, as a palpable signpost to the Transcendent, guiding us on our path of worldly detachment.  
  
In this philosophical vista, we find echoes of Soren Kierkegaard's and Martin Heidegger's existential ponderings, the mystical depths of Meister Eckhart and Miguel de Molinos, and the profound stillness in the Eastern traditions of Buddhism, Vedanta, and Taoism. All these paths, in their own unique ways, confront or welcome life's inherent void. Figures as diverse as Emil Cioran and Paul Tillich, though seemingly disparate, converge in the realm of Nihiltheism, finding common ground in the embrace of Nothingness.  
  

### **Embracing the Void: The Nihiltheistic Journey through Existential Despair**  

Nihiltheism stands in stark contrast to philosophies that shy away from existential despair, instead plunging its adherents into its depths. This perspective resonates with historical philosophical and religious insights, such as William James’ notion of the 'divided self', Kierkegaard's 'double-mindedness', Heidegger's concept of 'always falling', Plato's critique of the human body, Vivekananda's battle against ego, and the Christian idea of 'original sin'. Nihiltheism perceives the Nothingness of the physical realm not as an escapable anomaly but as an unyielding truth, ever-present yet elusive.  
  
This philosophical lens scrutinizes the engulfing nature of terrestrial nihilism, reducing all human endeavors to a cosmic joke, plunging the individual into a chasm of despair, doubt, and existential terror. Yet, within this abyss, there emerges a yearning to explore realms beyond the naturalistic, to question whether such profound emptiness might herald a divine revelation.  
  

### **Psychedelic Transcendence: Journey Beyond the Mundane**  

In the Nihiltheistic paradigm, psychedelics emerge as conduits to the Transcendent. When approached with philosophical rigor, the right mindset, and intention, these substances can usher in encounters with an 'Infinite Presence', transcending time and space. These experiences, mirroring the mystical, hint at a 'Full' or 'Plentiful' Nothingness, challenging the boundaries of a naturalistic worldview and inviting contemplation of the divine.  
  

### **The Pendulum of Existence: Oscillating Between the Transcendent and the Mundane**  

In the aftermath of transcendent experiences, Nihiltheists often find themselves in a liminal space—oscillating between a Platonic recollection of Forms and the stark reality of worldly Nothingness. This dynamic breeds an existential purgatory, a battleground between subjective illusion and the quest for objective truth.  
  
In Nihiltheism, morality assumes a novel form: 'non-movement', akin to Taoist principles of non-action. This philosophical stance transcends traditional ethical paradigms, embracing non-action not as a moral choice, but as a fundamental renunciation of the physical world.  
  

### **The Circular Endeavor: The Paradox of Nihiltheistic Enlightenment**  

Nihiltheism challenges the notion of transcending Nihilism, viewing such endeavors as escapist fantasies. It cautions against the seduction of ascribing meaning to the meaningless, suggesting that these attempts only fortify our delusions. In a continuous embrace with the Nothingness of existence, Nihiltheism positions philosophy as not just a cerebral exercise, but as a vital preparation for the inevitability of death, echoing the timeless wisdom of Plato. In its essence, Nihiltheism becomes a paradoxical guide to enlightenment, finding profound truth in the heart of emptiness.
