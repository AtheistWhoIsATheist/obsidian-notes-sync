# Summary Prompt

“I need a detailed summary of this note, such that one who isn't familiar with the issues discussed would understand. Don't put your response all in one message, as I'm sure it will be lengthy.  Make a plan to search through the note step by step, through each of the chapters (1. Nihilism Preface, 2. The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism, 3. The Uncanny illusion of Naturalism, 4.  The Startling Encounter with Nothingness, 5.  The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing) and do not skip any chapters.  You will return back to the text and follow up searching, in a cyclical manner, pulling out 4-5 new ideas, concepts, or entities that span an audience spectrum from someone who has never read philosophical works before, all the way up to the export who’s the intellectual authority figure in his particular specialty within philosophy. When you return to the text and cannot find any more key aspects, of the highest of levels, that the philosophical expert would find interesting,  then your task is complete.”_**
