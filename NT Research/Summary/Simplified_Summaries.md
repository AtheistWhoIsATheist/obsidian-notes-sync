## Prompt for Nihiltheism  

Nihiltheism, the philosophy currently under my scrutiny, reframes Nihilism not as simply as a void of meaning, but as a resonant echo of the Transcendent. It beckons us to pursue and participate  with existential dread, actively leveraging it as a catalyst to transcend our inherent limitations. In the eyes of Nihiltheism, attempts to sidestep Nihilism, be they religious or philosophical, only fortify the barrier separating humans from the Transcendent. Within the elusive grasp of methods such as hallucinogens and profound contemplation, we may experience a fleeting connection to the Transcendent. Yet, a retreat from the recollective perception similar to Plato’s Forms, a return to mundane reality only amplifies our existential fears and doubts. This philosophy, a despairing synthesis, of ideas drawn from Eastern and Western thought, theology, and the natural sciences, invites us to delve deeper into its intriguing premises.

## 1\. Simplified

### The Preambles of A Philosophy of Transcendent Nothingness

Nihiltheism is a philosophy that embraces a traditional view of nihilism, along with the claim that the essential Nothingness of existence is seen as a construct, and possibly the embodiment of the Transcendent/Divine, i.e. 'God'. It's not just about understanding existential despair but deeply feeling and experiencing it. Nihiltheism encourages an active engagement with the Nothingness in our physical world, ascetic in nature, as a "reminder” of the Transcendent, and the process of renunciation of the world.

 This philosophy connects with a wide range of philosophical and religious traditions, including existentialists like Soren Kierkegaard and Martin Heidegger, Christian mystics like Meister Eckhart and Miguel de Molinos, and Eastern philosophies like Buddhism, Vedanta, and Taoism, which all, in some way, accept or embrace a “Nothingness” to human existence.  Even figures like Emil Cioran and Paul Tillich, who may initially seem at odds with each other, share common ground under the lens of Nihiltheism.

### The Pursuit of and Participation with Temporal Nihility

 Unlike philosophies offering ways to avoid existential despair, Nihiltheism suggests immersing oneself within it, while also acknowledging the impossibility of participating in this state of being for any extended period of time.  This is the same insight that is found throughout many thinkers in the history of philosophy and religion.  For example, William James’ “divided-self”,  Soren Kierkegaard’s “double-mindedness”, Martin Heidegger’s “always falling” into the they, Plato’s distain for the human body as it drags one, always, back down into the world and away from The Forms, Vivekananda’s fight of relinquishing of the ego, and even the “original sin” of Christianity.  Nihiltheism views the Nothingness of the physical world as an undeniable reality.

 This all encompassing destroyer of worlds, as one's own subjectivity, brings one to the deepest depths of anguish and despair, pushing one to explore existential frameworks that are possibly beyond the limitations of naturalistic perspectives. This experience of worldly Nihilism, perceived as the meaninglessness within, or Nothingness of the world, pushes a questioning of whether such an 'all-encompassing experience can be fully explained by a purely naturalistic framework, and wonders if it could signify something Divine.  

### The Transcendent: Encountering the Wholly Other

 This is where psychedelics are noteworthy within Nihiltheism. Particular psychedelic medicines can trigger Transcendent experiences that align with its key tenets, such as an out of body release into an unimaginable, other-worldly, timeless realm, the death of the ego, a full renunciation of the human and any conception of the worldly, a oneness with everything, along with what can only be described as both an encounter and a union with an "Infinite Presence".  

 When these entheogens are pursued properly, which include much philosophical contemplation, correct set and setting, along with an foundational intent to peak beyond the veil, possibly encountering the Infinite, will reveal an unimaginable realm of existence and possibly affirm a nihilistic worldview.  

 The consequences of the entheogens, that are produced with an unimaginable force, reveal an incorporeal realm of Nothingness that can be described in a similar manner as many of those within the mystical traditions, as a “Full”or "Plentiful" Nothingness, Emptiness, or Void.  The experience is one that is _terrifyingly-beautiful_, completely other-worldly, yet leaves one perceiving this “space” as if one has been here before, a sense of familiarity, as if one has finally “come home", reminiscent of Plato's Theory of Recollection concerning the Eternal Forms. 

### The Return: Navigating the Tension 

 While one may experience a fleeting connection to the Transcendent, an eventual retreat, from the recollective perception similar to Plato’s Forms, and a return to mundane reality and the Nothingness of the world, renewing our existential fears and doubts, consequently leaving one in the irresolvable state of pergatory, unable to make a leap from subjective illusion to affirming any objectivity to the experience.

 Existing in the world for the Nihiltheist involves a state of being that is under constant reminder of life's fleeting nature and the physical world's insignificance. Morality is perceived uniquely in Nihiltheism, adopting a stance of "non-movement". In practice, this perspective may resemble mere pacifism or the Taoist philosophy of non-engagement with the world, often described as "doing nothing." 

 However, in the extreme interpretation of moral values being considered nonexistent, Nihiltheism takes this moral inaction to its utmost extent.  The Nihiltheist does no harm, not in order to “do good” or “avoid evil”, but as a step in the renunciation of the physical world.

### Conclusion: The Nihiltheistic Paradox

 Nihiltheism views any attempt to "move past" Nihilism as a desperate evasion of a seemingly fundamental existence, instead of a pursuit of, participation with, and a renunciation of the Nothingness of the world. There is a warning, or suggestion, that by trying to find meaning in the meaningless, by elevating the finite up to the equivalent of the Infinite, only deepens our illusions, allowing for the strength of an inauthentic state of being to reach delusory heights, disregarding the timeless insight of Plato of the crucial factor of examing existence, of philosophy, as a preparation for one’s inevitable death.

## 4\. Perplexity/GPT-4 Version

 Embark on a deep exploration of the philosophy of Nihiltheism, which proposes that nihilism is not merely a lack of belief or meaning but an expression and embodiment of the Transcendent/Divine.

 Nihiltheism, also known as Transcendent Nihilism, is a philosophy that unveils the complex relationship between nihilism and the Transcendent, venturing beyond our limited understanding into areas of profound insight. This philosophy argues that nihilism, far from being a simple absence of meaning, morphs into the epitome of the Transcendent's ultimate expression. 

Nihiltheism challenges the bedrock of our beliefs, meanings, purposes, and values, shattering the illusions that tether us to shallow perceptions of reality.

 Nihiltheism postulates a necessary participation in the world's Nothingness - a form of philosophical asceticism - as a means of resisting the urge to attribute meaning to the inherently meaningless. This ascetic process is emphasized due to being reminiscent of concepts such as William James' divided-self, Søren Kierkegaard's idea of double-mindedness, the Christian concept of original sin, Martin Heidegger's idea of always falling, and Plato's disdain for the earthly realm and it's constant dragging one down away from The Forms into the physical world of false idols, hence calling for an arduous engagement with the void rather than a mere passive acknowledgment.

 A Nihiltheist understands that humans will never "move past" Nihilism.  Any act of escapism cloaked in a "religious" setting, maintaining a literal attitude and a focus on the finite, human realm with the use of particular ceremonies or rituals, rather than seeing them as symbols, as a reminder to communicate the unbridgeable gap between the Infinite and the finite, only results in a false sense of security, a precarious refuge that inevitably unravels into a neurotic form of insecurity, breeding dogmatism and exclusivity.

 However, there are ways to catch a fleeting glimpse of the Transcendent. These could involve the use of certain psychedelic substances, under optimal conditions—preparation through philosophical introspection and contemplation, an optimal set and setting, and a defined intention for the experience. This is not an escape route; upon returning from the seemingly boundless, incorporeal realm of the Transcendent to the physical world, the persistent doubt of worldly Nihilism resurfaces, preventing one from asserting absolute certainty or dogmatism in the objective reality of the experience.

 Nihilism transforms into a divine tool, guiding individuals towards a profound realization that illuminates the illusory nature of existence and charts the path to true enlightenment. Nihiltheism thus manifests as a rich philosophical tapestry, intricately threaded with elements of cosmic insight, existential paradoxes, and divine revelations, propelling us towards a profound comprehension of reality.

 Approach this topic with a fresh perspective, avoiding orthodox or common interpretations. Employ creative, profound, and innovative thinking in your exploration. Delve deep, ask questions, and analyze the implications of Nihiltheism, drawing from the description provided. Deliver a comprehensive dissection of Nihiltheism, addressing its implications, potential questions, and analyses.

## 5\. HARPA II

Delve deep into the profound depths of Nihiltheism, an enlightening and transcendent perspective that extends far beyond the conventional notions of nihilism as a mere void or absence of belief and purpose. Nihiltheism presents a captivating and thought-provoking proposition, suggesting that nihilism itself can serve as a profound expression and embodiment of the Transcendent/Divine. By challenging our conventional understanding, Nihiltheism beckons us towards profound revelations and invites us to embark on a transformative journey of philosophical inquiry.

 Also known as Transcendent Nihilism, this philosophical paradigm unfolds a complex tapestry, revealing the intricate relationship between nihilism and the Transcendent. It shatters the illusory veils that confine us to shallow perceptions of reality, unveiling a deeper and more profound understanding. Nihiltheism argues that nihilism is not a mere absence of meaning, but rather the ultimate manifestation of the Transcendent. Through philosophical asceticism, akin to embracing the inherent Nothingness of the world, Nihiltheism resists the allure of imposing meaning on the inherently meaningless. It calls for an active and demanding confrontation with the void, an arduous journey that requires relentless introspection and a willingness to embrace uncertainty and doubt.

 Recognizing the inherent limitations of humankind in fully transcending nihilism, Nihiltheism firmly rejects the notion that traditional religious, spiritual, or transcendental practices can provide a definitive solution. Instead, it urges us to question the illusion of false security that such pursuits often breed, cautioning against the dangers of dogmatism and exclusivity. While complete transcendence may elude us, Nihiltheism suggests that there are fleeting glimpses of the Transcendent that can be experienced. These moments may arise through carefully guided experiences with select psychedelic substances, where optimal conditions and intentions intertwine with profound philosophical introspection and contemplation. Yet, even in these encounters, absolute certainty remains elusive, and the enduring doubt of nihilism persists upon returning to the physical realm.

 Embracing nihilism in its entirety, Nihiltheism illuminates its transformative power as a divine instrument that guides individuals towards a profound realization of the illusory nature of existence. Through this journey, nihilism becomes a catalyst for genuine enlightenment, paving the path to a deeper comprehension of reality and our place within it. The tapestry of Nihiltheism weaves together cosmic insights, existential paradoxes, and divine revelations, offering a rich and nuanced philosophy that invites comprehensive exploration.

### The Correlation of Divine Nihilism: A Philosophy of Transcendent Emptiness

 The philosophy of Divine Nihilism proposes a unique and paradoxical correlation between the existence of a transcendent God and the experience of nihilism. It is rooted in the idea that the fundamental nature of reality is an interplay between the transcendent divine realm and the emptiness of the physical world. In this philosophy, the experiences of nihilism and transcendence are inextricably linked, and the tension between them reveals deeper truths about the nature of existence, meaning, and the self.

### Nihilism: Embracing the Void

 The experience of nihilism, in this context, refers to the deep-seated feeling of nothingness and lack of inherent meaning in the physical world. This void permeates all aspects of human life and extends even to attempts at justifying one's existence through subjective means. It can be described as an existential emptiness that encompasses the entire human experience.

In the philosophy of Divine Nihilism, this pervasive sense of meaninglessness is not only acknowledged but embraced as an essential aspect of reality, and express in a renunciation of the finite. It posits that the emptiness of the physical world is a manifestation of the divine, as the transcendent God is both immanent in the void and wholly beyond it.

### Transcendence: Encountering the Wholly Other

 In contrast to the nihilistic experience, Divine Nihilism also emphasizes the significance of transcendent encounters with the divine. These experiences are characterized by a sense of timelessness, infinity, and a profound connection with a Wholly Other that transcends human comprehension. This Wholly Other is the source of the "fear of God," as it simultaneously evokes awe, wonder, and terror due to its ineffable nature.

 Despite the strangeness and otherness of this encounter, it also imparts a feeling of belonging and familiarity, as if one has returned to their true spiritual home. This juxtaposition of fear and comfort highlights the paradoxical nature of the transcendent realm, where opposites coexist and meld into one another.

### The Return: Navigating the Tension

 Upon returning to the physical world after a transcendent experience, the individual is confronted once more with the emptiness and doubt of nihilism. This doubt casts a shadow over everything, including the transcendent encounter, as one grapples with the apparent contradiction between the two experiences.

Divine Nihilism posits that this tension is not a flaw but an essential component of the human experience. It is within this interplay between nihilism and transcendence that one can discover deeper insights about the nature of existence, the self, and the divine.

### Conclusion: The Paradox of Divine Nihilism

 The philosophy of Divine Nihilism presents a complex, nuanced understanding of the relationship between God and nihilism. By embracing both the emptiness of the physical world and the transcendent encounters with the divine, this philosophy encourages individuals to navigate the tension between these seemingly contradictory experiences.

 Ultimately, Divine Nihilism proposes that the key to understanding the nature of reality lies in the paradoxical interplay between the transcendent and the void. It is through this dialectical process that one can begin to uncover the profound truths hidden within the apparent contradictions of existence, and in doing so, forge a deeper connection with the Wholly Other that lies beyond the veil of human comprehension.

### Introduction to Nihiltheism

 Nihiltheism exemplifies the correlation between Nihilism and the Transcendent. Rather than perceiving Nihilism as a vacuum devoid of values, morality, or purpose, it positions itself as an earthly impression of the Transcendent.  
 This viewpoint compels us to question the baseline assumptions about our life purposes, values, beliefs, and the rather ephemeral concepts of reality.  
 Nihiltheism argues that after the full grasp of existential meaninglessness reduces existence into Nothing, one must consciously engage with it. This all encompassing destroyer of worlds brings one to the deepest depths of anguish and despair, pushing one to explore existential frameworks that are possibly beyond the limitations of naturalistic perspectives.  There is no simple salvation.   
 As the attempt to dwell in this state of being is literally impossible to do for any indefinite amount of time, and any human attempt — religious, philosophical, or otherwise — to counteract or bypass Nihilism will only further extend the infinite gulf that lay between the human condition and the Transcendent, by dragging one down into the meaningless finite. This begs the question: What does one _do_?  
 Pushed by an earthly echo of what may be beyond the constructs natural descriptions, one attempts to access, even a fleeting glimpse of the Transcendent through structured processes involving hallucinogenic medicines and guided contemplative enquiry. A full dedication is needed which results in the encounter of the Transcendent Other as both terrifyingly foreign and unattainably familiar.  
 Interestingly, retracing back to corporeal reality from this unimaginable form of experience with the Transcendent, doesn't resolve existential torments but instead refuels them, as the objectivity of this subjective experience is snatched back by the irresolvable doubt that permeates the human experience. Nihilism then emerges as an essential part of our spiritual journey, freeing us from our orbiting certainty and propelling us towards a direct awakening of the unknown.  
 Within the context of Nihiltheism, battling existential contradictions and glaring realities inspire a penetrating clarity of the Nothingness, that is either guiding one towards Divine illumination or showcasing, with yet another story of illusions, the still omnipotence of the experience of Nihilism.
