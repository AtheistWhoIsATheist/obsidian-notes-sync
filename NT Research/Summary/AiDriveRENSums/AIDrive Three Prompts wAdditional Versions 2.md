# AIDrive "Three Prompts" w/Additional Versions

[[AiDrive - Three Prompts (five prompts)]]

Saturday, March 16, 2024

[[claude]],#promptgenerator, [[lex]], [[cyclical]]

### Things to Consider when Creating a Prompt

1. Define which persona ChatGPT is playing (ex: you are an expert 8th grade math teacher in the United States, you are an experienced real estate agent in London, etc).
2. Ask it to write down a research plan and to think step-by-step: this is very important for longer documents. Sometimes it is also good to ask it to keep running notes as it may forget things it learned in the past.
3. Specify the result you want: you may want it explained in technical or layperson language, you may want it in bullet format or presented in the style of a big consulting firm report.

##   

# Examples

## 1\. Step-by-Step Research using Personas

### Use case:

Longer or more complex documents where you want ChatGPT to do several passes in a document exploring an area of interest from the point of view of a specific persona. 

  

### Prompt:

Take a look at this file with the latest Supreme Court decision. Look for the role that Justice Alito played in the decision. First, write down your research plan as a lawyer with expertise in SCOTUS cases would. Execute it step-by-step, writing down key findings in a concise way. Summarize in the end his positions and opinions on the issues discussed.

* * *

  

# 2\. Directed Summary - Longer Doc Summary

## Use case

Get ChatGPT to explore and summarize information across a book's chapters. While not exactly a long doc summary, it should cover more than the standard Ai PDF summary.

####   

## Prompt:

Please read the summary of this book's first pages. 

Prepare a plan for search and comprehensive summary as follows: 

  

\* Write down a series of questions, one for each chapter. 

\* Make sure to write down ALL chapters and questions. 

\* Execute the plan step by step, after each step re-write the entry for that chapter on the plan by adding a brief summary of what you learned, the following to the next question. 

  

Here is an example of the plan: 

Chapter 1 xyz: Question 1

Chapter 2 wsr: Question 2

…

Chapter N djfd: question N.

  

Executing the plan: 

\* \[ask question 1\]

\* \[summary of answer in one paragraph\]

  

Rewrite the plan: 

\* Chapter 1 xyz: question 1: summary: summary\_xyz. 

\* Chapter 2 wsr: Question 2 .. 

\* Chapter N djfd: question N: \[ask question 2\], \[summary of answer in one paragraph ...\], etc until all questions in the plan have a summary attached. You can ask all questions until you are done without asking me for permission to continue.

# 3\. Chain-of-Density Summary

## Prompt:

You will create the perfect prompt for inquiring into the philosophy of Nihiltheism, aiming to take its ideas and concepts to the highest level of clarity and the deepest depths of sophistication, in multiple steps. 

\* Start by asking Ai PDF for the summary of the first pages and follow on with searches. 

\* Your goal, each iterative step, is to generate a rigorously academic, scholarly prompt that is the perfect of this document that is ready for publication in a n academic philosophical journal, focusing primarily on the main goal and five or ten key concepts or entities introduced in the document. 

\* Keep the summary coherent, nuanced and profound.

  

\\\*\*Iterative Densification\*\*: for each subsequent search step, perform a search and refine the summary by incorporating additional details (entities) from the document ensuring the summary is expanded upon and adheres to the highest academic standards for ideas, language, and formatting.

  

\\\*\*Step 1\*\*: Instruction: Based on the initial summary, refine it by incorporating 5-10 additional key entities or concepts from the document, increasing the overall length. Focus on significant elements or information in the document, and ensure the summary remains coherent and philosophically sophisticated.

  

\\\*\*Step 2\*\*: Instruction: Further refine the summary by searching for and adding 5-10 more salient entities or details from the document, elements a philosophy and religion scholar would note down, again increasing the overall length. Additionally, with each new iteration becomes ever greater in sophistication, elevating your summary from a Professer of Philosophy or Religion and to the leading intellectual authority on the subject, diving deeper than ever before, extracting nuanced aspects of the text that only the expertise of an elite philosopher and theologian are capable of further enhancing the informativeness of the summary.

  

Repeat instructions for Step 3, ... up to N until your searches do not return additional salient entities besides what you have already searched and incorporated into the academically rigorous summary. Without confirmation from user, continously \*\*follow up and search\*\* the entirety of the text until you are done finding entities. Do not waste time by asking for permission to continue.

## **4.  AiDrive:**

To embark on this intellectual journey of analysis, synthesis, summarization, through to Markmap, I propose the following plan:

1. **Initial Overview**: I will begin by summarizing the preface of the book to grasp the foundational themes and objectives laid out by the author. This will provide us with a preliminary understanding of the book's scope and the philosophical inquiries it aims to address.
2. **Chapter-by-Chapter Exploration**:
    - For each chapter, I will craft a question that aims to uncover the core argument or philosophical inquiry discussed within. This question will guide our exploration and ensure that our analysis remains focused and insightful.
    - Following the formulation of these questions, I will proceed to answer them through a detailed examination of the respective chapters. Each answer will be accompanied by a brief summary that encapsulates the key points and insights gleaned from the chapter.
    - Chapters in book:
        - \-Nihilism Preface-
        - Chapter 1: The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism
        - Chapter 2: The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism
        - Chapter 3: Madness, Nonexistence, and the Other
        - Chapter 4: The Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness
        - Chapter 5: The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing

3. **Iterative Analysis**:
    - After summarizing each chapter, I will revisit the summaries to refine and deepen our understanding. This iterative process will allow us to build upon our initial interpretations and uncover more nuanced perspectives on the text.
4. **Synthesis and Conclusion**:
    - Upon completing the chapter-by-chapter analysis, I will synthesize the insights obtained into a 750-1,000 word, comprehensive overview. This final step will encapsulate the philosophical journey we've undertaken, highlighting the most significant revelations and the overarching narrative woven throughout the book.
5. **Markmap:**
    - Lastly, I will provide along side the comprehensive, synthesized summary, a detailed, branching out Markmap to act as a visual guide to the comprehensive summary.

# 5\. AiDrive

To begin this task, I'll first outline a step-by-step research plan based on your instructions:

1. **Initial Overview**: I'll start by summarizing the first few pages of the document to understand the book's theme, structure, and the titles of its chapters.
2. **Draft Questions**: Based on the initial overview, I'll draft a series of questions, one for each chapter identified, focusing on the core themes, arguments, or narratives presented in each.
3. **Execute the Plan**:
    - For each chapter, I'll ask the drafted question and then summarize the answer in one paragraph.
    - After summarizing the answer for a chapter, I'll update the plan by rewriting the entry for that chapter, adding the brief summary next to the question.
    - This process will be repeated for all chapters, updating the plan step by step until all questions have a summary attached.

Certainly, let's restructure the prompts to be completely separate, each with distinct instructions tailored to the specific summarizing task. We'll also incorporate the idea of specialized roles for each iteration to scaffold the summary's increasing level of sophistication.

# 6.2 Prompt for Summarizing the Entire Document

  
\## Instructions:  
  
1\. \*\*Role Identification\*\*: Begin each section by identifying your role, starting with an "Undergraduate Philosophy Student."  
  

2\. \*\*Section-by-Section Summary\*\*: At the end of each section, create a bullet point summary from the perspective of the specified role.  
  

3\. \*\*Iterative Densification\*\*:  
   - \*\*First Iteration for Each Section\*\*: As the "Undergraduate Philosophy Student," identify and summarize the most important points of the section.

  - \*\*Sections in sequential order\*\* = "Nihilism Preface", "The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism", "The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism", "Madness, Nonexistence, and the Other", "The Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness", and " The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing".  
   - \*\*Second Iteration\*\*: Promote your role to a "Graduate Philosophy Student" and refine the summary accordingly, deepening the analysis by expanding on its details in a more educated, knowledgeable, and nuance way.  
   - \*\*Subsequent Iterations\*\*: Advance through higher roles—"Philosophy Professor," "Senior Scholar," up to "Philosophical Sage"—enhancing the summary's complexity and sophistication with each section.  
  

4\. \*\*Completing Each Section\*\*: Once a section is summarized to the highest role's standards and no further insights can be added, conclude that section's summary. Ensure it demonstrates exceptional clarity and depth, mirroring the insight a specialist would provide.

  

5\. \*\*Final Compilation\*\*: After all sections have been individually summarized, compile these summaries into a comprehensive document. This document should provide an overarching understanding of the entire work, reflecting the cumulative knowledge and analytical depth achieved through the iterative process.  
  

6\. \*\*Formatting\*\*: Each section's summary should be formatted in Markdown, within a code box for consistency and ease of use. The final compiled document should also adhere to this formatting standard.  
  
\---  
  
Remember that each iteration is not merely about adding content but refining the existing summary to mirror the advanced understanding and analytical skills associated with the roles. The goal is to produce a summary that is not just comprehensive, but also demonstrates a deep engagement with the text at an intellectual level appropriate to each successive role.
