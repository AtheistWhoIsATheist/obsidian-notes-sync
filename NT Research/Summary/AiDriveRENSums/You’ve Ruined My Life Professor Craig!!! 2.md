 "_You've ruined my life professor Craig:_ that's the title of the letter and that was written to you in our question-and-answer forum at reasonablefaith.org, Dr. Craig. Some, many in fact, are saying, including myself, this is the greatest letter in the question-and-answer forum of unreasonable faith. Now, there are some great ones in there, not to diminish any of them, but there's something about this one that is very compelling.  Rather than read the whole thing, we're going to kind of look at highlights here, because I want to encourage people to go to the website and look at this letter:  you've ruined my life professor Craig. Did this really strike you as a letter that was had a lot of compelling content oh it?

  

**\*\*Professor Craig\*\*:  Oh,**it really did Jan was the one who read it first and then forwarded it to me and said look at this letter from this fellow named Adam and it's a long letter but as I read it I just grew more and more wide-eyed to see how what I think is evident that God is really at work in this fellow's life and the degree of philosophical training that he has and his insights into the arguments I thought set him apart from and above many of the popular level sorts of non-theistic responses that we often get I want to say from the outset bill that many people who follow reasonable faith have looked into this writer and have found him to be genuine and that this Fake was not a sophisticated troll to use the vernacular of the internet that this wasn't a a fake because immediately there were some skeptics who said is fake this is too good to be true this reads like a movie script you know and a good idea now there there is a point there to all this we we do have to be careful yes the the internet contains a lot of disk information not just that information as well as good information right I have been suckered more than once by things on the internet that I thought were authentic and then found out later they were not yeah we get accused quite often of lying for Jesus as it's called there's even a website I think lying for Jesus and it tries to catch people who think that there's somehow justified to lie so there are many aspects to this letter but his love of philosophy and the fact that he was he considered himself an evangelical atheist evangelistic atheist but claiming the good word of rationalities rationality he says my beliefs were striding at best intolerant and at worst he thought he had the gun question all figured out he applied in college and to get an MA program at CSULA he got accepted at Cal State University Los Angeles yeah and but the real sticking point seemed to be your essay on the absurdity of life without God he said here you were telling me my life as a direct result of my worldview was worthless in every possible way well as an ambitious philosophy student I could not simply let you get away with this your objections to atheism needed answers and so he really wrestled with your paper and he went on he did come to Nihilism is unlivable the conclusion that nihilism is unlivable he quotes Christopher Hitchens but this letter is very detailed what do you think was his frustration what began to emerge as his frustration he didn't want to be a nihilist apparently no but I think he to be convinced that the arguments of the so-called new atheists who want to try to preserve objective meaning value and purpose in life were ultimately failures and I really appreciate it so much woody says in the paragraph that he says I need to say how disappointed I am in the New Atheists and moreover the professional philosophers who do not understand the moral argument for God's existence why can't they comprehend the ontology of values why is this so Why is this so difficult difficult and I this is something that has baffled me as well Kevin they the obviously wrong sort of responses to this argument where people think you're saying you can't know right from wrong without believing in God or the belief in God is necessary to live the moral life just clearly a misunderstanding of the argument people ought to know better and I I appreciate what he said days he goes on I'm sorry I just had to rant a little because it bothers me when philosophers who should know better don't comprehend the moral argument I can only imagine how frustrated you must feel further I hate all the nasty comments you get on YouTube people don't even understand how well-thought-out your views are so he said sorry I just wanted to say that you have at least one atheist on your side sir well that was very gratifying I I agree with almost everything you say think to hear yes 90% of the negative comments are sour grapes very petty and thoughtful people know it but it's just everywhere it's very lowbrow and he gets frustrated with that and I know a lot of non-believers who are frustrated with that as well because they're not interacting accurately he says philosophically I agree with almost everything you say not in a follower sense but in that I find what you say either convincingly to arrive by come to the same conclusion that you do with regards to particular ideas that I have reasoned through on my own he says but that said I'm still an atheist well how is that possible how could my favorite philosopher be a Christian I agree with almost everything he says yet I am an atheist he says well it seems that you make an extremely strong case for the rationality of an abstract notion of God I'm not sure what You dont teach the God his abstract he meant by that because you don't teach the God his abstract no I know he has that in scare quotes yeah the word abstract and I think what he means by that is God as a sort of philosophical conclusion but not as an experiential or existential reality in your life not something that changes your life and so we can't seem to get that make that step from the head to the heart I think perhaps yeah he says I'm an atheist who hates atheism yeah I want there to be a god yeah I just can't more than anything yet I cannot get myself to believe and bottom line Billy says what do you suggest that I do you know I mean yeah he's incest Kevin this is strange I know the answer is Christianity he knows it The existential dilemma but he said I can't get myself to believe it's truth so this is a I mean a real existential dilemma here he doesn't need more arguments I I think he's already I think got enough arguments to know that God exists and even that Christianity is true but there needs to be that existential engagement on adam's part with God as a real reality in his life he says PS do me one favor you never have time to respond please do not debate Lawrence Krauss anymore he says as with most people not trained in philosophy it's not even an argument in any sort of philosophical seei he doesn't need to say I am NOT going to teach professor Krauss in another dialogue because I I thought it was just Wrong nerves utterly unprofitable this hits so many wrong nerves especially among atheist they tell me my friends nothing makes them angrier than the fact that they are told that they are consigned to nihilism now the other thing that makes them angry is that you you can't be moral you know without a belief in God and we straighten that out right you know we do but this whole thing about don't consign me to to nihilism because I'm not an e list yeah he says yes you are or you should be you should near inconsistent with your worldview and in fact I argue that it's really impossible to live consistently and happily within the framework of an atheistic worldview so that if you want to be happy you're going to do what your friends do and Being consigned to atheism that is to live inconsistently you you make a leap of faith and affirm objective values meaning and purpose for your life even though you don't have any basis for it and as for being consigned to kneel ISM this is a claim that isn't emanating simply from Christians or Thea's this is what many atheists themselves say and I'm thinking of people like Nietzsche Russell Sartre and then on the contemporary scene people like Joel Marx Alex Rosenberg and others who have the courage of their convictions to say what atheism frankly leads to so this is not a sort of accusation that one can pin on theists this is an implication that many the use themselves recognized now when you began to answer him you said first CS Lewis of all Adam you kind of remind me of the same route that CS Lewis took yes in preparing for the CS Lewis Memorial conference last year at Westminster Abbey I read Lewis's biography by Alister McGrath and recalled some of Lewis's writings and it struck me how similar Adams experience is to see us Lewis as Lewis was a scientific naturalist for much of his life he really thought that all that exists is what's given to us by the Natural Sciences but he found that utterly dreadful and such a worldview unlivable and pointless meaningless he as a professor of literature loved fantasy and imagination and fiction and Seek Experiences of Sublime Beauty his dilemma was that everything that he thought was real left him empty and Hollow and everything that he loved his intellect told him was imaginary and so how could he come to terms with this and I think that Lewis's autobiography would be a real help to Adam and so that was one of the things that I recommended he do read Lewis is surprised by joy and see how Lewis made that gradual transition from naturalism to theism and then finally from theism to Christianity second thing you said is to seek experiences that put you in touch with the transcendent you need to escape the cloying bonds of naturalism by catching glimpses of a transcendent reality beyond the material world this will help to prepare your heart for belief in God so open yourself to experiences of sublime beauty now you suggest several Take a Sabbatical things here a bill I want to throw in okay one thing that I would encourage a person in Adams position and many Christians as well take a sabbatical from the internet and the online forums and the heat of all the debates because you know this community there and you feel compelled that you've you've got all these threads unanswered and these post unanswered and you can't leave them dangling you've got to go back and you can literally become distracted by the heat of all this coming at you it take a sabbatical from it you know I mean do you like Paul and stay away three years if you have to yeah this was something that Pascal recognized as well in talking to The Libertines of his day that the way in which we escaped dealing with these deep questions of meaning in Distractions life and the existence of God is by cluttering our lives with distractions and I think you're absolutely right Kevin I'm interacting with some people now who I think are close to receiving Christ who are real heavy into the forum's and debating and my my advice is okay you know I want you to receive Christ and and so on and then I don't want to see you on here for a year send me an email or a text but stay out of it per year as a means of discipleship now that's that's general but I just think it's a good principle yeah you know yeah you go what I was trying to highlight here was another lesson really comes out of Louis's life is to realize that things like beautiful music and art and other experiences where we grasp the Transcendent Reality beautiful put us in contact with a kind of transcendent reality beyond scientific naturalism scientific naturalism can give you a description of the sunset in of the refraction of the light rays through the atmosphere and the dust and the geology of the surrounding countryside and silver but it can't do anything to capture the beauty of the sunset and so if we can capture glimpses of this transcendent realm of beauty and value I think this will prepare our hearts for a transcendent reality like God you recommended some symphonies and some other things what did you recommend well I recommended divorce action New World Symphony which i think is just beautiful and then rimsky-korsakov's Scheherazade which has this violin that Recommended Music just weeps it is so gorgeous when this refrain comes on with the violin I find this kind of music just sublime but of course everyone has his own favorites but these were just some suggestions for adduser' and you being one on one with him yeah yeah very much so in in this you said also for him to read the Gospels yes go back to Jesus in the characterises right there's tremendous attraction in this man Jesus of Nazareth in the authenticity of his life such a courageous and bold man who faced his own death because of his radical personal claims and commitments and teachings there's real authenticity here and then there is wonderful wisdom as well he was a really smart guy who Reading the Gospels confounded the religious leaders of his day and I think reading the Gospels reading the life of Jesus can again really open one up to the truth of Christianity after that you said go ahead and supplement the power of that with some resources that bolster the historical grounds for the resurrection right one of the things that I noticed about Adams question was he showed a familiarity with philosophical arguments for theism but there was almost nothing in the letter that suggested that he had explored the historical credibility of the New Testament records of the life of Jesus and particularly the central miracle of the New Testament his resurrection from the dead and so I think Adam would do well to look into that it really is quite remarkable as I've said before that the central facts that undergird the inference to the Begin to pray daily resurrection of Jesus are accepted by the majority of historical Jesus scholars today whether they be evangelical non evangelical Christian Jewish or secular gave him two more bits of advice 1 number 5 embark on a spiritual experiment begin to pray daily attended church where the gospel is faithfully preached and you can be with Christians and get to know them and you kind of am I do I see you saying bill you're kind of sick go ahead and just put the ball in God's court yeah well give God a chance to write right it may sound funny for an agnostic to pray to God but I see no reason why an open agnostic cannot say God if you're there lead me to yourself show me the way and hope that that prayer will be answered and I think that this is the The Hound of Heaven way in which one begins to open oneself to this transcendent spiritual reality and to recognize your need of forgiveness and moral renovation by God the final bit of advice why right was to get a copy of Frances Thompson's poem the Hound of heaven I think that it describes so beautifully Adam himself someone who is running from God and God is like this relentless hound pursuing him after him no matter where he goes what he does this hound is on his tracks and will not let him go until he finally recognizes in God that here is all that I've been longing for and never realized it and although Frances Thompson's poem is very sophisticated literally it's it's in a sense archaic in its poetry if you take the time to read it and meditate on it I think it's just a beautiful poem about God's relentless pursuit of a lost soul until that person recognizes in God the fulfillment of human existence we'll follow up on this letter and you can get the entire transcript of the letter and dr.
