Dissertation Title: Nihiltheism: Reconceptualizing Nihilism as a Transcendent Expression

<br>

Abstract

<br>

This dissertation explores the novel conception of nihilism as a transcendent expression within the framework of Nihiltheism. By critically deconstructing traditional nihilistic and theistic philosophies, this study seeks to synthesize a new philosophical paradigm that reconciles the inherent meaninglessness posited by nihilism with the pursuit of transcendence typically associated with theism. Through a phenomenological synthesis of key philosophical texts, an in-depth analysis of the interrelations between nihilism and transcendence, and the development of a conceptual framework, this work aims to contribute significantly to contemporary philosophical discourse. The implications of this framework on our understanding of existence, meaning, and purpose are thoroughly examined, alongside a critical reflection on its strengths and limitations. Ultimately, this dissertation posits Nihiltheism as a viable and transformative philosophical stance that offers profound insights into the human condition.

<br>

1. Introduction

<br>

1.1 Background and Context

<br>

Nihilism, as a philosophical doctrine, asserts the absence of inherent meaning, purpose, or value in existence. Traditionally perceived as a bleak and pessimistic worldview, nihilism challenges the foundations of meaning-making systems, including religion, morality, and societal norms. On the other hand, theism, particularly in its monotheistic forms, posits the existence of a transcendent deity who imbues existence with purpose and meaning. The juxtaposition of nihilism and theism presents a profound philosophical tension: the assertion of inherent meaninglessness against the belief in a purposeful divine being.

<br>

Nihiltheism emerges as an attempt to bridge this dichotomy, proposing a synthesis where nihilistic recognition of inherent meaninglessness coexists with theistic pursuit of transcendence. This dissertation delves into this novel conception, aiming to reconceptualize nihilism not as a purely destructive force but as a foundation for transcendent expression and personal meaning-making within a theistic framework.

<br>

1.2 Research Question

<br>

How can nihilism be reconceptualized as a transcendent expression within the framework of Nihiltheism?

<br>

1.3 Objectives

<br>

 • To conduct a thorough phenomenological synthesis of key philosophical texts related to nihilism, existentialism, and transcendentalism.

 • To analyze and interpret the interrelations between nihilistic and transcendental thought.

<br>

1.4 Significance of the Study

<br>

This study contributes to the field of philosophy by offering a nuanced understanding of nihilism, traditionally viewed in isolation from transcendental pursuits. By proposing Nihiltheism, this dissertation provides a fresh perspective that accommodates the existential void while embracing the human inclination towards transcendence and meaning-making. This synthesis has potential implications for various philosophical disciplines, including ethics, metaphysics, and existential psychology.

<br>

2. Philosophical Inquiry

<br>

2.1 Synthesis

<br>

2.1.1 Analysis of Philosophical Texts

<br>

The phenomenological synthesis begins with a comprehensive analysis of seminal texts in nihilism, existentialism, and transcendentalism. Key works include Friedrich Nietzsche’s “Thus Spoke Zarathustra,” Jean-Paul Sartre’s “Being and Nothingness,” Søren Kierkegaard’s “Fear and Trembling,” and Immanuel Kant’s “Critique of Pure Reason.” These texts provide a foundational understanding of the concepts of meaning, existence, and transcendence.

Nihilism

: Nietzsche’s exploration of nihilism delves into the “death of God” and the ensuing crisis of values, highlighting the vacuum of meaning that emerges when traditional belief systems are deconstructed. Sartre’s existentialism further elaborates on the notion of “existence precedes essence,” emphasizing the absence of predetermined purpose and the imperative for individuals to create their own meaning.

Transcendentalism

: Kant’s transcendental philosophy focuses on the conditions of possible experience and the role of the transcendental in structuring human cognition. Kierkegaard, often associated with existentialism, introduces the concept of the “leap of faith,” navigating the tension between rational skepticism and the embrace of transcendent belief.

Existentialism

: Sartre and Kierkegaard’s works intersect with nihilistic themes, presenting a landscape where individuals confront the absurdity of existence and the responsibility of self-definition in a seemingly indifferent universe.

<br>

2.1.2 Identification of Key Themes and Concepts

<br>

Several recurring themes and concepts emerge from these texts:

 1. Meaninglessness and the Absence of Inherent Purpose: Central to nihilism is the assertion that existence lacks objective meaning, a theme prominently featured in Nietzsche and Sartre’s works.

 2. Transcendence and the Pursuit of Meaning: Despite the recognition of inherent meaninglessness, transcendentalism and certain existentialist perspectives advocate for the pursuit of personal or transcendent meaning through faith, creativity, or self-determination.

 3. The Role of the Individual: Both nihilism and transcendentalism place significant emphasis on the individual’s role in navigating and constructing meaning within their existential framework.

 4. Ethical Implications: The deconstruction of inherent meaning challenges traditional ethical systems, prompting the need for new moral frameworks that accommodate the absence of objective values.

 5. Existential Anxiety and Authenticity

: Confronting the void of meaning induces existential anxiety, which can be mitigated through authentic existence and personal engagement with transcendent ideals.

<br>

2.1.3 Connections Between Nihilistic Thought and Transcendental Experiences

<br>

The synthesis reveals that while nihilism and transcendentalism appear antithetical, there exists an underlying potential for their integration. The acknowledgment of inherent meaninglessness in nihilism can serve as a catalyst for transcendental pursuits, driving individuals to seek or construct their own forms of meaning and purpose. This interplay suggests that nihilism may not only deconstruct but also enable a form of transcendence rooted in personal and subjective experiences.

<br>

2.2 Analysis

<br>

2.2.1 Examination of Relationships Between Identified Themes and Concepts

<br>

The relationship between nihilism and transcendence is complex and multifaceted. Nihilism’s deconstruction of objective meaning does not preclude the human inclination towards transcendence; rather, it redefines it. In the absence of inherent purpose, transcendence becomes an individualistic and self-defined endeavor, shifting from seeking external validation to internal fulfillment.

<br>

Patterns Identified:

 • Duality of Destruction and Creation: Nihilism dismantles established meaning systems, creating a void that can be filled through transcendental pursuits.

 • Interdependence of Meaning and Transcendence: The pursuit of transcendence often arises as a response to the recognition of meaninglessness, highlighting their interdependent nature.

 • Existential Responsibility

: Both nihilism and transcendentalism emphasize the individual’s responsibility in defining their existence and ethical framework.

<br>

Contradictions Noted:

 • Objective vs. Subjective Meaning: Nihilism denies objective meaning, while transcendentalism often relies on an objective transcendent reality. Reconciling these requires a shift towards subjective interpretations of transcendence.

 • Despair vs. Hope

: Nihilism is frequently associated with despair due to the absence of inherent meaning, whereas transcendentalism embodies hope through the pursuit of higher purpose. Balancing these emotions is a critical challenge.

<br>

2.2.2 Support and Challenge to the Notion of Nihilism as a Transcendent Expression

<br>

The analysis reveals that nihilism can indeed support the notion of transcendence when reconceptualized as a foundation for personal meaning-making. By accepting the absence of inherent purpose, individuals are liberated to pursue their own forms of transcendence, unbound by traditional frameworks. However, this reconceptualization also challenges existing notions of transcendence that rely on objective or divinely ordained meanings, necessitating a more subjective and individualized approach.

<br>

2.3 Conceptual Framework

<br>

2.3.1 Proposal of a Novel Conceptual Framework: Nihiltheism

<br>

Nihiltheism is proposed as a conceptual framework that integrates nihilism and transcendence, redefining the role of the individual in constructing meaning within a theistic paradigm that acknowledges inherent meaninglessness.

<br>

Core Components:

 1. Acknowledgment of Inherent Meaninglessness: Accepting the nihilistic premise that existence lacks objective purpose or meaning.

 2. Transcendental Pursuit: Engaging in the pursuit of transcendence through personal, subjective experiences and belief systems.

 3. Subjective Meaning-Making: Emphasizing individual responsibility in creating and sustaining personal meanings and ethical frameworks.

 4. Integration of Theistic Elements

: Incorporating aspects of theism, such as belief in a higher power, as a subjective source of transcendence rather than an objective foundation of meaning. 5. Ethical Autonomy: Developing ethical systems that are derived from transcendent values while recognizing their subjective nature.

<br>

<br>

2.3.2 Addressing the Research Question

<br>

Nihiltheism addresses the research question by providing a framework where nihilism serves as the foundational acknowledgment of meaninglessness, thereby enabling transcendental pursuits that are self-defined and subjective. This synthesis allows for the coexistence of nihilistic and theistic elements, redefining transcendence not as an objective truth but as a personal journey towards meaning-making within an inherently meaningless existence.

<br>

2.3.3 Contribution to the Field of Philosophy

<br>

Nihiltheism offers a transformative approach that bridges the gap between nihilism and theism, presenting a cohesive philosophy that accommodates both the absence of inherent meaning and the human drive for transcendence. This framework challenges traditional dichotomies, fostering a more nuanced understanding of existence that is both critical and constructive. It opens new avenues for exploring ethical systems, existential psychology, and metaphysical inquiries within a synthesized philosophical paradigm.

<br>

2.4 Implications

<br>

2.4.1 Understanding of Existence

<br>

Nihiltheism reshapes our understanding of existence by positing that meaning is not inherent but can be constructed through transcendental pursuits. This perspective emphasizes the fluid and dynamic nature of existence, where individuals navigate and define their own purposes within an indifferent universe.

<br>

2.4.2 Meaning and Purpose

<br>

The framework suggests that meaning and purpose are not bestowed externally but are actively created by individuals through their engagement with transcendent ideals and personal values. This shifts the locus of meaning-making from external authorities to internal autonomy, fostering a more individualized and authentic sense of purpose.

<br>

2.4.3 Ethical Considerations

<br>

Nihiltheistic Ethics emerges as a moral system grounded in subjective transcendental values rather than objective or inherent purposes. This approach allows for ethical flexibility and adaptability, accommodating diverse belief systems and personal convictions while maintaining a structured framework for moral behavior.

<br>

2.4.4 Psychological Impact

<br>

Acknowledging the existential void and embracing transcendence as a personal journey can have profound psychological implications. Nihiltheism offers a pathway for individuals to cope with existential anxiety by fostering resilience and autonomy in meaning-making, potentially enhancing mental well-being and personal fulfillment.

<br>

2.5 Critical Reflection
