Detailed summary


## Introduction to the Document and Key Study
- The document "Mysticism, Psychedelics, and Nihiltheism" examines the relationship between mystical experiences, psychedelic substances, and nihiltheism through a critical analysis of eight sources, including empirical studies, theoretical commentaries, and journalistic accounts.
- The study by Griffiths et al. (2006) is a landmark double-blind study that demonstrated the ability of the psychedelic Psilocybin to reliably induce mystical-type experiences in a controlled laboratory setting, with 67% of participants rating their psilocybin session as among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant events of their lives.
- The findings of the study suggest that psilocybin can produce effects indistinguishable from spontaneously occurring mystical experiences, complete with durable increases in life satisfaction and prosocial attitudes, and raise questions about the nature of spirituality and whether it can be reduced to neurochemistry or if psilocybin is tapping into genuine metaphysical insights.
- The document approaches these discussions through the lens of nihiltheism, which assumes that all meaning-structures and values are ungrounded unless rigorously justified, and challenges the sources to confront hidden assumptions and theological residues that may underlie their discussions of psychedelic epiphanies.

## Nihiltheism as a Critical Framework
- The analysis places each source in conversation with existentialist thought and mystical/nihilist traditions, including the ideas of Søren Kierkegaard, Eckhart, Nishitani, Tillich, and Cioran, to expose performative contradictions and existential tensions, such as the tension between claims of newfound sacredness and the nihilistic idea of an ultimately groundless universe.
- The document aims to extend each source's insights by proposing new concepts or paradoxes that align with a radical nihiltheistic perspective, and to explore whether a "sacred nothingness" can be understood or lived, with ontological honesty and philosophical rigor being paramount throughout the analysis.
- The study by Griffiths et al. is subject to a nihiltheistic critique, which argues that the study carries hidden assumptions that are ripe for critique, and invites theologians and philosophers to grapple with the implications of the study's findings for our understanding of spirituality and the human experience.

## Critique of the Griffiths et al. Study's Assumptions
- The study on psychedelics and mystical experiences assumes that "meaningfulness" and "spiritual significance" are quantifiable outcomes, which implies an unstated teleology that increased meaning and prosocial behavior are desirable end-goals, a notion that nihiltheism questions and challenges.
- The research is based on an empiricist-humanist worldview that values psychological well-being and assumes meaning is positive, but it provides no ultimate justification for why a "mystical" feeling of unity should be lauded beyond subjective preference, and instead smuggles in a quasi-religious reverence for meaning and "the sacred".
- The study uses the Mystical Experience Questionnaire, which measures experiences with terms like "sacred", and by doing so, it may be covertly sanctifying the experience, and nihiltheistically, one might argue that the researchers have fallen prey to what Nietzsche called human "valuation", creating a new value, the "psychedelic sacred", while ignoring that from the universe's viewpoint, no experience is inherently sacred or profane.
- The findings of the study evoke a deep tension between the idea that an artificially induced mystical state can truly alleviate existential meaninglessness, and the possibility that it may only paper over the void, with participants feeling that their session was life-transforming and profoundly meaningful, but existentialists like Søren Kierkegaard or Albert Camus might challenge this, arguing that if the universe is absurd or God "silent", these drug-fueled epiphanies may be pleasant illusions rather than authentic leaps of faith.
- The study highlights a performative contradiction, where a scientific experiment produces unscientific convictions, such as participants' comments about experiencing the essence of the Universe or God's unconditional love, which nihiltheism would argue is a clash between methodology and outcome, and a failure of the study's neutrality, as it inclined volunteers to find grounded meaning, whereas nihiltheism insists that any such meaning must be interrogated.

## Conceptualizing Nihiltheistic Approaches to Psychedelics
- The livability of these newfound meanings also bears scrutiny, as it is reported that attitudes and behaviors improved, suggesting that the mystical beliefs "work" in practice, but nihiltheism would argue that usefulness is not a validation of truth, and that what "works" might still be a lie that people choose to believe, recalling William James's pragmatism versus nihilism's insistence that what "works" might still be a fiction.
- The concept of "laboratory-validated nihilism" is introduced, which suggests that psilocybin-induced unity can be interpreted as an encounter with the abyss of self, rather than proof of cosmic meaning, and this experience of no-self or nothingness can lead to long-term positive changes.
- A nihiltheistic model proposes a "Null Mysticism" approach, where the psychedelic experience is framed as a visceral realization of the groundlessness of all things, rather than a meeting with God, and this could potentially yield the same therapeutic benefits or even greater freedom.
- The work of Griffiths et al. is referenced, and their findings are re-read through a nihiltheistic lens, suggesting that the transformative power of psychedelic experiences may lie in the ego-death itself, rather than the specific content of the revelation.

## Michael Pollan's Article and Clergy Experiences
- Michael Pollan's article "This Is Your Priest on Drugs" is discussed, which explores the effects of Psilocybin on the spirituality of ordained clergy from different faiths, and finds that many participants emerged with renewed faith and became "evangelists for psychedics" after their guided trips.
- The study mentioned in Pollan's article, conducted by Johns Hopkins University/NYU, found that 79% of participants reported enhanced clerical effectiveness, enriched prayer life, and a deepened sense of the sacred in everyday life, and 96% ranked the psilocybin session among the top five most spiritually significant events of their lives.
- The idea of using psychedelics to induce mystical experiences in religious professionals is seen as both simple and radical, and the results of the study suggest that this approach can have a profound impact on the participants' spiritual lives and their sense of the sacred.
- The article discusses the potential of psychedelics, specifically psilocybin, to induce profound spiritual experiences, with researcher Matthew Johnson warning of the risk of researchers imposing their own spiritual beliefs on the study.
- The study in question had significant methodological limitations, including the lack of a placebo control and a self-selecting sample, which may have contributed to expectancy bias and led participants to report "sacred experiences" due to the suggestive language used in the questionnaire.
- The article's author, Pollan, situates the modern experiment in a larger historical context, noting that psychedelic substances have likely played a role in ancient religious rites, such as the Eleusinian mysteries and Native American spirituality, and that organized religions have long suppressed these practices.

## Methodological Limitations and Theological Bias in Research
- The convergence of modern science and indigenous traditions suggests that certain plants can mediate contact with "the divine," raising philosophical questions about the authenticity of chemically catalyzed religious experiences and the stability of the "faith" they produce.
- The article's underlying assumption is that experiences described as "sacred" or "mystical" have inherent value, particularly for revitalizing religion, and that chemically induced epiphanies could reverse the decline of organized religion, which is a kind of instrumental theology.
- A nihiltheistic perspective would challenge this assumption, questioning why reigniting religious participation is a desirable goal, and arguing that the goal of re-sacralizing society is just one arbitrary preference among others.
- The article is also criticized for its covert theological bias, with researchers and guides carrying a quasi-religious narrative into the lab, essentially prescribing the content of the epiphany, and fulfilling their own prophecy by having participants report universal or God-like encounters.
- Statistician Andrew Gelman is mentioned as one of the observers who pointed out the expectancy bias in the study, highlighting the need for a more neutral and secular approach to researching the effects of psychedelics.
- The emergence of psychedelic churches and the carving out of religious freedom for entheogen use by courts are seen as a loosening of the repression of these practices by organized religions, and a potential convergence of modern science and mystical traditions.

## Performative Contradictions in Religious and Psychedelic Experiences
- The article discusses Michael Pollan's piece, which suggests that psychedelics might save religion from irrelevance, a notion that is undergirded by a value judgment that religion is worth saving, a stance that nihiltheism would question as potentially clinging to old meaning structures by new means.
- Pollan's narrative includes voices like Rick Strassman, who expresses concerns about selection bias and confirmation bias in psychedelic research, highlighting that the desire for meaning can generate its own fulfillment, a notion that nihiltheism agrees with, as humans will grasp any opportunity to imbue life with significance.
- The article notes a performative contradiction in the clergy's role, as they preach that the divine is accessed through faith, scripture, and prayer, yet they themselves needed a drug to rekindle their faith, implying that the entire edifice of religious meaning is shaken if grace can be reduced to a pill.
- Nihiltheistic analysis questions whether the use of psychedelics to access the divine is a real door or just a convincing illusion, and whether the content of these mystical experiences is just the mind's projection, shaped by personal and cultural expectations.
- The scenario described by Pollan resonates with classic mystical accounts, such as those of Meister Eckhart, who spoke of the need to let go of images of God to encounter the Godhead, but nihiltheism highlights the tension between earned mysticism, achieved through years of ascetic discipline, and instant mysticism, achieved through sudden intoxication.
- The article also touches on the idea that these mystical experiences were not pure void or pure transcendence, but were colored by personal and cultural expectations, as evidenced by the fact that each cleric saw a version of their own tradition in the trip, suggesting that the content is just the mind's projection, a notion that nihiltheism underscores.
- The dialogue between existentialism and mysticism is also explored, with references to philosophers like Søren Kierkegaard, who compared the difference between authentic faith earned through the dread and despair of confronting nothingness, and a shortcut "leap" given as a gift, highlighting the tension between the depth of confrontation and the instant gratification offered by psychedelics.

## Nihiltheistic Analysis of Spiritual and Existential Tensions
- Overall, the article raises important questions about the nature of mystical experiences, the role of psychedelics in accessing the divine, and the implications of these experiences for our understanding of religious meaning and the human condition, all of which are central concerns of nihiltheism.
- The concept of Nihiltheism and Buddhist emptiness theory suggests that visions and experiences, even if subjective and profound, are ultimately empty of inherent reality and are just mind phenomena, which is echoed in Sartre's notion that humans create their own meaning in life.
- The use of Psilocybin by clergy, as discussed by Pollan, can lead to vivid and meaningful experiences, but it also raises questions about the long-term outcomes and the potential for a "comedown of meaning" when the drug wears off, leaving individuals to confront the possibility that their ordinary lives may seem mundane in comparison.
- A nihiltheistic extension of Pollan's idea is that psychedelics could be used to facilitate a confrontation with nothingness, guiding individuals through the death of their faith and potentially leading to a more authentic standpoint, as described by Zen's concept of Great Doubt or Nishitani's idea of going through nihility.
- This concept can be applied in an experimental spiritual retreat where the goal is not to "meet God" but to experience the abyss of divinity's absence and discover what truth emerges, which would be a true Nihiltheistic Rite, taking the mystical encounter as a profound existential unmasking.

## Critique of Sanders & Zijlmans' Secular Framework
- The idea of "performative theology" is also introduced, where a new theology can be formalized around the insight that all religious imagery can be induced and deconstructed, and a Nihiltheistic Theology would openly acknowledge that experiences may be manufactured by the mind, treating them as meaningful fiction without metaphysical assertions.
- This approach would be radically honest, allowing individuals to acknowledge the subjectivity of their experiences and avoid dogmatic teleology, as seen in the example of a priest saying, "I met Christ in a vision induced by Psilocybin, but I do not claim this was objectively real, it was real for me and it healed me."
- The nihiltheist approach would also encourage participants to embrace uncertainty during the trip, avoiding predetermined sacred narratives and allowing for the possibility of philosophical insight to arise from the mismatches between expectations and experiences, as seen in the paradox of expecting nothingness and experiencing a presence, or expecting God and experiencing emptiness.
- The concept of re-enchanting religion via chemistry, as explored in Pollan's account, must be pursued hand-in-hand with disenchantment, acknowledging that any perceived enlightenment might be a personal projection onto the void, as cautioned by nihiltheism.
- Future studies could investigate the comparison between the psychological outcomes of experiencing the "dark night" under psychedelics, which is an experience of divine absence, and experiences of divine presence, to inform both theology and psychotherapy in the evolving intersection of mysticism and mind.
- Psychologists James W. Sanders and Josjan Zijlmans argue in their critical commentary, "Moving Past Mysticism in Psychedelic Science," that describing psychedelic experiences with terms like "mystical" or "sacred" imports supernatural and non-empirical assumptions into scientific research, creating a black box that science cannot explain.
- The "mysticism framework," rooted in William James' characterization of mystical consciousness, has been useful in categorizing experiences and predicting therapeutic outcomes, but Sanders and Zijlmans caution that this framework should not be used as a final explanation, and instead, researchers should probe what "mystical" entails in psychological or neurobiological terms.
- The authors encourage a shift to a secular, demystified framework, using terms like "oceanic boundlessness" or "peak experience" and breaking them down into measurable components, such as changes in self-referential processing or emotional release, to provide a more informative explanation of psychedelic experiences.
- Sanders and Zijlmans warn of the risks of framing psychedelic therapy with mystical jargon, including the formation of unrealistic expectations, adoption of unscientific beliefs, and spiritual suggestibility in clinical settings, which could also enable charlatanism or guru-ism, and instead advocate for a "demystified model of the psychedelic state" that seeks rational explanations for the phenomenology.
- The authors Sanders & Zijlmans suggest that simply renaming mystical-sounding terms in the field of psychedelic science is not sufficient and that a deeper re-think is needed to avoid replacing one euphemism with another, essentially keeping the concept as a "magical black box" that cannot be analyzed.
- They advocate for a scientific approach to understanding mystical experiences, challenging the boundary between empirical knowledge and the transcendental unknown, and pushing for a full naturalization of what others deem numinous, but in doing so, they harbor some assumptions of their own, such as the idea that objectivity and empirical analysis are the only valid ways to know reality.
- The authors' stance can be seen as a positivist approach, valuing explanatory power and skepticism towards anything "supernatural", which is a value-laden perspective that could be considered a creed in itself, and a nihiltheistic critique might argue that this insistence on a secular framework is just as value-laden as a mystical one.

## Tensions Between Scientific and Mystical Paradigms
- Sanders & Zijlmans assume that experiences interpreted in supernatural terms are necessarily an obstacle to truth, but a nihiltheistic critique might consider whether they inadvertently create a new idol, the idol of the empirical, and refuse to consider that subjective ineffability could point to aspects of reality that elude quantification.
- The commentary does not entertain the idea that mystical discourse might gesture at real phenomenological insights, and by calling it a "black box", they imply that anything not immediately accessible to measurement should be discarded or rephrased, which is a performative contradiction if all meaning-structures are ungrounded, including the framework of scientific naturalism.
- A nihiltheistic critique can question the authors' assumption that a "secular vocabulary" will necessarily be more honest, and that stripping away the word "sacred" might just hide the existential import under clinical jargon, and that the drive to explain mystical experiences does not guarantee that we can remove their awe or potentially life-changing narrative quality.
- The authors' goal of maximizing therapeutic efficacy in a rational way might be based on a hidden value judgment that belief in the supernatural is inherently negative or inferior, and that the "mystical experience" construct might be pointing to something real, such as a predictable cluster of psychological events with profound personal meaning, which cannot be removed by simply explaining it away.
- Ultimately, the critique suggests that Sanders & Zijlmans operate as though science is exempt from the groundlessness that plagues religion, and that they may be blind to the quasi-theology of scientism, which is the belief that everything meaningful must already be within the current scientific paradigm or soon will be if we just apply the tools.
- The authors Sanders & Zijlmans argue that "nonempirical belief systems" should be mitigated in research, but nihiltheism suggests that people should be allowed to find their own meaning, even if it is unempirical, as long as it is acknowledged as a human construct.
- The approach of Sanders & Zijlmans is seen as too dualistic by some philosophers, such as Nishitani, who argue that Western science excludes the "abyss" of meaning or inner reality, leading to its own nihilism, and that mystical traditions were attempts to address existential voids that science alone may not satisfy.
- The authors' approach can be seen as continuing the disenchantment of the world, a process noted by Max Weber, which has benefits such as eliminating superstition, but also leaves a meaning vacuum that gave rise to nihilism in the first place.

## Philosophical Foundations of Secular Mysticism
- Sanders & Zijlmans wrestle with the concept of ineffability, decrying the labeling of something as "ineffable" as a conversation-stopper, yet mystics across cultures emphasize that a core feature of their experience is indeed beyond words, highlighting a tension between language and experience.
- The authors firmly take the side that nothing is truly ineffable, but this confidence in method echoes the dogmatism they critique in others, and nihiltheism sees a contradiction in their use of strongly normative language while criticizing others for dogmatism.
- There is a tension between the sacredness of science and the science of the sacred, as Sanders & Zijlmans stand for the former, but the subject matter of mystical experiences came into science because it was delivering results, and stripping the interpretation of these experiences as spiritually meaningful might reduce their efficacy.
- The authors acknowledge that mystical experiences have predictive validity for outcomes, but their strictly secular approach runs into existentialist insight that "unscientific" hope or belief can sometimes be life-saving, and nihiltheism would reconcile this by saying that groundless meanings can be knowingly adopted for their utility.
- The commentary by Sanders & Zijlmans falls on the side of cold truth, demystifying and explaining mystical experiences, rather than indulging mystical narratives, in order to maintain scientific integrity, but this approach may undercut the meaning that helps people change and highlights an existential tension between cold truth and warm meaning.
- Philosophers such as Viktor Frankl and Wittgenstein are referenced in the discussion, with Frankl arguing that humans are meaning-seeking creatures and Wittgenstein highlighting the limits of language in describing certain experiences, and Nishitani's philosophy is also mentioned as a counterpoint to the authors' approach.
- The philosophical nihilist Emil Cioran is referenced as someone who was fascinated by mystics, and his perspective is used to highlight the similarities between the pursuit of scientific purity and the ascetic impulse of monks, suggesting that science and mysticism may not be as different in structure as they seem.
- The concept of "Secular Mysticism" is proposed as a nihiltheistic middle path, where science could move through mysticism and translate its insights without the supernatural baggage, treating experiences like "oceanic boundlessness" as real phenomenological categories to be dissected and understood.
- This approach would involve breaking down "mystical experience" into components like perceptual decoupling, loss of egoic narrative, openness to awe, emotional catharsis, and felt sense of connectedness, which could be studied and linked to outcomes, such as reduced depression and rumination, thereby fulfilling the call for demystification.

## Ontological Shock and Existential Distress in Psychedelic Experiences
- A nihiltheistic perspective also invites a paradoxical "mysticism of nothingness", where the ultimate ineffable insight offered by psychedelics is that there is no ultimate truth, and patients can be helped to confront this void safely, emerging more free and able to build a new chosen meaning.
- The ideas of Nishitani, who said that true emptiness lies beyond personal nihilism, are referenced, suggesting that a therapy could be developed to use psychedelic experiences to help patients feel that meaning frameworks are illusory, and out of that crisis, build a new meaning, all without invoking the supernatural.
- Future research paths suggested include developing better measurement tools for the subjective qualities of psychedelic states and empirical studies to test interventions to mitigate expectancy bias, such as comparing outcomes in groups with different expectations about the effects of psychedelics, as proposed by Sanders & Zijlmans.
- The discussion on the benefits of mystical framing in psychedelic experiences suggests that if both groups, those with and without mystical priming, yield similar benefits, it would support the stance of Sanders and Zijlmans that mystical framing is not necessary, and a nihiltheist approach can still utilize illusions pragmatically while remaining aware of their nature.
- A study by Eirini K. Argyri and colleagues, titled "Navigating Groundlessness," explores the concept of "ontological shock" and existential distress following profound psychedelic experiences, where participants reported feeling disoriented and grappling with fundamental questions about reality, self, and meaning after their ordinary sense of reality was shattered.
- The study found that psychedelics can precipitate ontological shock, defined by Paul Tillich as the profound disorientation that occurs when one confronts the threat of non-being, leading to encounters with what felt like ultimate truths or terrifying voids, and coupling with core existential concerns like death, meaninglessness, isolation, and freedom/responsibility.
- The researchers note that this risk of ontological shock might be especially pronounced in secular contexts where people lack communal or religious frameworks to interpret the experience, leaving them "ungrounded" and potentially falling into nihilistic despair, as they struggle to integrate their encounter with what they perceived as God or eternity that doesn't fit their prior beliefs.
- However, the study also explores how individuals cope and integrate after such crises, using tools like journaling, philosophical study, spiritual frameworks, or finding support groups, such as adopting terms like "spiritual emergency" from Stanislav Grof, and turning to practices of gratitude and self-compassion to reground themselves in simple existence.
- The overall discussion emphasizes the importance of intellectual honesty in research, as championed by Sanders and Zijlmans, and the need for ontological honesty, which includes acknowledging the limits and psychological needs of science, to approach a more rigorous understanding of psychedelic experiences that neither blindly venerates them nor reductively dismisses the personal realities felt during them.
- The study by Argyri et al. explores the concept of ontological shock, where individuals experience a shattering of their reality, often as a result of psychedelic experiences, and highlights the importance of interpersonal support and community in helping them cope with these experiences.

## Cultural and Sociological Implications of Ontological Shock
- The researchers found that some participants were able to reconstruct meaning after their ontological shock, either by returning to a previous religion with a new perspective or by creating a personal synthesis of ideas to make sense of what happened, while others struggled with prolonged negative effects.
- The study emphasizes the need for more research on how cultural context, such as secular versus religious society, influences the fallout of ontological shock, and notes that understanding the complex interplay between ontological shock and mental health is crucial.
- The authors' approach is somewhat unique in that it doesn't have a motivational bias, but it does carry implicit values, such as the assumption that experiencing "groundlessness" is something that needs navigating, and that finding a way back to some sense of ground or stability is desirable.
- A nihiltheistic perspective, however, might question this assumption, suggesting that learning to permanently live in groundlessness could be the ultimate liberation, and that meaninglessness could be an accurate reflection of reality to be accepted rather than a problem to be solved.
- The study's framing of "coping" with ontological shock implies that meaninglessness is treated as a problem to be solved, rather than an opportunity for growth or liberation, and the authors' citation of Tillich suggests that confronting non-being is part of faith's evolution, but even Tillich believed in finding a new "ground of being".
- The researchers also note that traditional meaning structures, such as religion, can act as a buffer or support, and that adopting possibly unfounded frameworks can be acceptable, even beneficial, if they help individuals navigate existential chaos, a perspective that nihiltheism flags as a potentially conscious choice of comforting illusion.
- Overall, the study highlights the complex and nuanced nature of ontological shock, and the need for further research on the interplay between cultural context, mental health, and the search for meaning in the face of existential uncertainty.
- The authors of the study appear to view their approach as a humane practice, rather than an illusion, as they bridge objective research with subjective meaning-making by entertaining spiritual and philosophical frameworks as tools in a scientific journal.
- The study seems to endorse "meaning management" as a technique, which presupposes that some meaning, even if self-fabricated, is better than none, and this value stance can be seen as life-affirming, although a true nihiltheistic purist might argue that one should endure the lack of narrative without flinching.
- The concept of "existential distress" is treated as an injury that needs care, medicalizing a philosophical problem, and the study aligns with a therapeutic teleology, where mental well-being is the goal, which may be questioned by nihiltheism as it may view depression as a rational response to the world's absurdity rather than a disorder.

## Therapeutic Applications and Nihiltheistic Critiques
- The study assumes it is better to overcome nihilistic crises than to succumb, which is a sensible but value-based assumption, and it shows a bias toward life affirmation over pessimistic realism, as seen in the example of a participant using gratitude to cope and choosing a positive value like "life is a gift".
- The study connects to existentialism, as participants confronted classic existential concerns such as "death, meaninglessness, responsibility, and aloneness", which is where nihilism and mysticism meet, and the experiences of some participants can be compared to spiritual traditions like Zen, where guides and doctrines contextualize the void.
- The study notes that in secular societies with weakened communal meaning, individuals are more vulnerable when their belief system collapses, which is a sociological restatement of Nietzsche's "God is dead and we have killed him" scenario, and this observation is supported by scholars like Nishitani, who argues that encountering nihility is inevitable in modern life, but Westerners often lack a way through it.
- The findings of the study can be interpreted as the moment where a person realizes the contingency of their being, leading either to despair or to a search for a new Ultimate Concern, as suggested by Tillich, and this highlights the importance of finding a framework to contextualize the void, as mystics and spiritual traditions have done.
- The concept of "spiritual emergency" is mentioned as a way for people to reinterpret their experiences, highlighting the tension between sacredness and nothingness, with some individuals finding the divine beneath the horror, while others experience pure destabilization with no positive outcome.
- Different participants responded to their experiences in varying ways, with some, like "Fred", adopting a Camus-like gratitude and rebellion against absurdity, while others, like "Beth", needed a narrative or story to cope with their experiences, illustrating the range of responses on the existential spectrum from nihilistic depression to resilient meaning-making.
- The study reveals that people often struggle with the idea of absolute nothingness and will seek out anchors or meaning, even if it's an ad hoc one, with some individuals adopting seemingly contradictory stances, such as acknowledging the irreversibility of change while also holding onto the hope of overcoming it.
- The human psyche appears to be unable to sustainably confront the idea of nothingness, with most people requiring some form of support or community to avoid collapse, echoing Kierkegaard's idea that confronting despair often requires a relationship, whether with God or fellow humans.
- The concept of "existential safety nets" is proposed as a way to mitigate the harms of ontological shock, with potential approaches including the development of integration groups that allow for open discussion of nihilistic and spiritual interpretations, as well as "Guided Nihilism Therapy", which involves guiding individuals to confront and process the terror of groundlessness in a supportive environment.
- This therapeutic approach would involve encouraging individuals to emotionally process the idea of nothingness, rather than quickly reassuring them of meaning, and could also involve supporting creative meaning-making, such as empowering individuals to choose a meaning-framework consciously and adopt a provisional narrative to live by, as inspired by the ideas of philosophers like Nietzsche, Nishitani, and existentialists like Albert Camus, Cioran, and Sartre.

## The Role of Psychedelics in Religious and Spiritual Evolution
- The study suggests a future research path to examine the role of culture and belief in psychedelic experiences, comparing outcomes of users in secular vs religious countries, and those who prepare with a particular philosophy vs those who don’t, to determine if frameworks like Buddhism can lead to fewer crises when confronted with ego-death.
- Preliminary intuition indicates that frameworks with concepts for ego dissolution, such as Nirvana or union with God, might cushion the shock of ego-death, and research could verify this, posing the question of whether psychedelic therapy should deliberately borrow from religious or spiritual frameworks to help patients.
- The researchers Argyri et al. hint that people often informally use spiritual frameworks to cope with psychedelic experiences, and a clinical trial could test a secular integration program vs a spiritually-informed one to see differences, while acknowledging the warning by Sanders & Zijlmans that this might inculcate unempirical beliefs.
- Nihiltheism could resolve this issue by providing full transparency, telling patients that these frameworks are optional stories to help with integration, and none is proven true, allowing patients to use what resonates with them, effectively using an "as-if religion" therapeutically.
- The study by Argyri et al. underscores the importance of communal meaning-making, and one potential model is creating "psychedelic chaplains" or existential counselors trained to guide people through ontological collapse, who could be versed in nihiltheistic thought and help patients find values and meaning in a post-ego-death world.
- The work by Ko et al. conducted a systematic review of 12 clinical studies on psychedelic therapy, finding a significant association between the intensity of mystical experience and the degree of symptom reduction in 10 out of 12 studies, suggesting that mystical experience might be a common mechanism by which psychedelics facilitate healing, regardless of the specific illness.
- The mystical experience is defined by features like "oceanic boundlessness", ego-death, transcendence of time/space, and a sense of interconnectedness or sacredness, which have been closely linked to both symptom reduction and improved quality of life across diverse disorders.
- The researchers Ko et al. note that the mystical experience has been linked to better clinical outcomes in mental health treatments, and navigating groundlessness might become as integral to psychedelic therapy as inducing the mystical experience itself, highlighting the need for more nuanced investigation into the role of mystical experience in psychedelic therapy.
- The review by Ko et al. examines the relationship between mystical experiences and the therapeutic effects of psychedelics, finding that individuals who had profound unity experiences were more likely to stay sober and experience mood improvements in cases of depression and alcoholism.
- However, the review also highlights the limitations of the existing studies, including small sample sizes, lack of control groups, and demographic diversity, as well as the potential for expectancy to inflate the mystical experiences and outcomes due to the open-label design of many studies.

## Instrumentalization of Mystical Experiences in Therapy
- Ko et al. suggest that more research is needed to understand the nature of the mystical experience itself, including what predicts a strong mystical experience and how to maximize its positive effects while minimizing anxiety, and propose that therapy protocols could aim to facilitate such states through set and setting optimization and preparatory spiritual practices.
- The review embodies a utilitarian view of the transcendent, assuming that improving mental health is the paramount goal and that mystical experiences are valuable insofar as they contribute to that goal, which raises questions about the intrinsic versus instrumental value of mystical experiences and whether their instrumentalization strips them of any truth-claim and authenticity.
- The authors' approach is also based on certain assumptions, including the acceptance of the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) as a valid measure of mystical experiences, which defines mysticism in a broad and somewhat sanitized way, focusing on structural features rather than specific religious content, and the idea that it is acceptable to use possibly illusory experiences to achieve real-world outcomes, similar to the way a placebo works.
- From a nihiltheistic perspective, the review's instrumentalization of the mystical experience and its focus on psychological wellness as the primary goal could be seen as problematic, as it implies that the value of a mystical experience lies in its ability to produce a desired outcome rather than in its inherent truth or connection to ultimate reality, and that the experience itself may be reduced to a mere means to an end rather than being valued for its own sake.
- The concept of mystical experiences, as studied by Ko et al., is based on the intensity of the experience, rather than the interpretation or ontology of the experience, which can lead to vastly different existential understandings of the same experience.
- This approach assumes that the common phenomenology of the experience is what matters, not the underlying metaphysics, and that the feeling of meaning is therapeutic, regardless of the truth of that meaning, which aligns with humanistic psychology, as seen in Maslow's peak experiences.
- However, this approach has been criticized for potentially encouraging a new kind of spiritual hedonism or dependency, where the goal is to maximize the intensity of the experience, without considering the potential negative aspects, such as terror and challenge, which are often seen as integral to the mystical experience in mystical literature.
- Nihiltheism, a philosophical perspective, doubts whether a profound life-changing experience can be achieved without confronting the negative aspects, such as meaninglessness and fear of ego-death, and suggests that the therapeutic approach may be smoothing over these encounters with the void, rather than allowing for deeper transformation.
- The idea of prescribing a mystical experience as a form of therapy raises several contradictions and tensions, including the tension between the anti-utilitarian nature of mysticism and the utilitarian approach of therapy, where the mystical experience is being used as a dose-dependent effect to manage symptoms.
- This approach also raises questions about the performative contradiction of using a rational program to induce an experience that is often considered beyond rational grasp, and the potential intellectual hypocrisy of clinicians who may not share the patient's metaphysical optimism, which could lead to a secondary existential crisis.

## Therapeutic Nihilism and the Search for Meaning
- Furthermore, the treatment of mystical experience as an objective factor that can be measured and targeted raises tensions between the subjective and objective, as mystical experiences are wholly first-person and unique to each individual, which is reminiscent of the quantum physics observer paradox, where measuring the experience may change it.
- The work of researchers such as Argyri et al. is also relevant to this discussion, as they highlight the importance of integration and the potential clashes between new beliefs and reality, which can lead to further existential crises.
- Overall, the study of mystical experiences and their therapeutic potential raises complex questions about the nature of reality, the human experience, and the role of therapy in inducing and interpreting these experiences, which are not fully addressed by the current approach, and require a more nuanced and philosophical understanding of the underlying issues.
- The concept of using mystical experiences to cure patients raises the question of whether patients might manufacture or report a mystical experience under pressure, creating a kind of "placebo spirituality" or "forced mysticism" due to the expectancy confound, which is a potential bias noted by Ko et al. in their studies.
- This ambiguity of truth is a theme that nihiltheism explores, and it is possible that patients might be convincing themselves of a profound experience to fulfill a narrative that it will heal them, leaving the question of whether they are lying to themselves or if it is a self-fulfilling truth.
- Theoretical extensions of the concept of mystical experiences in therapy include the idea of "therapeutic nihilism", which suggests that embracing meaninglessness could be equally therapeutic, and that accepting the lack of inherent meaning in life could alleviate certain forms of suffering, such as existential anxiety.
- This approach is different from "mystical materialism", which aims to optimize mystical experiences through material means, such as tailored music, virtual reality, or brain stimulation, but nihiltheism cautions that this could risk cheapening the profound and turning it into a commodity.
- The idea of "therapeutic nihilism" could be explored in a psychedelic context, where inducing a state of peaceful nothingness could help individuals prone to anxiety from excessive need for control, and future research could try to measure outcomes such as "acceptance of uncertainty" or "comfort with groundlessness" as equally healing.
- The concept of "benign nullity" is also introduced, where a person could find their depression lifted by realizing that there is no ultimate meaning and that the present moment is enough, which aligns with some interpretations of Buddhist nirvana, and this could be a potential area of research in psychedelic therapy.
- Ultimately, the text suggests that a theoretical model bridging the gap between mystical experiences and secular terms could be developed, and that this could help to articulate how a mystical experience leads to change in a way that is both meaningful and measurable.

## Cole-Turner's Theological Engagement with Psychedelics
- The ACER model, developed by Watts and Luoma, suggests that psychedelics increase psychological flexibility, which can be integrated with mystical experiences to promote new perspectives and personal growth, allowing individuals to adapt and find new ways of thinking.
- By demystifying the mystical experience, it is possible to retain the benefits of psychedelics without endorsing the associated metaphysics, a concept that Sanders and Zijlmans would likely support, while also acknowledging the potential value of fostering a sense of the sacred as a metaphor to fortify one's commitment to personal change.
- Future therapeutic approaches may incorporate ritual and symbolic elements, without requiring literal belief, to tap into the human psychology's response to ritual significance, aligning with William James's pragmatism and the principles of nihiltheism, which allows for the use of ungrounded values in a conscious and intentional manner.
- The idea of self-authoring of mythos for therapeutic ends is proposed, where patients create their own personal sacred story from their psychedelic experience, aware that it is their own creation, to inspire and motivate them, and this approach is supported by Ko et al.'s review, which suggests that such therapies can be effective.
- Future research directions include exploring the predictors of mystical intensity, which may inadvertently reveal predictors of suggestibility or spiritual openness, and examining the differences in outcomes between individuals who idolize the experience and those who remain skeptical, with a nihiltheistic lens suggesting that a healthy dose of skepticism may protect against over-interpretation and allow for more sustainable benefits.
- The challenge of handling the existential energy unleashed by psychedelics in a responsible manner is highlighted, with C.G. Jung's warning that "summoning the gods" into the psyche can have both healing and destructive effects, and the need for clear-eyed and rigorous approaches to navigate this complex and potentially volatile territory is emphasized.
- The article "Psychedelic Mystical Experience: A New Agenda for Theology" by Ron Cole-Turner argues that the findings of contemporary psychedelic research demand engagement from scholars of religion and philosophy, building on the challenge issued by Huston Smith in 1964 to consider the religious import of drugs.
- Cole-Turner asserts that hundreds of studies since 2006 have confirmed that psychedelics reliably induce intense mystical states, which are now linked to therapeutic breakthroughs, and that the evidence is so robust that it can no longer be denied that drugs can trigger genuine mystical-type experiences.
- These experiences are not just curiosities, but appear to be the reason psychedelics can treat mental illness by catalyzing profound shifts in perspective and self, and are forcing changes in the war on drugs logic, regulations, and even religious communities' views on psychedelics.
- Some churches are referring to psychedelics as "sacraments" or paths to deeper spirituality, and clergy are training as "psychedelic chaplains" to guide sessions, while leaders from Judaism and mainstream Christianity churches have begun to speak out in favor of careful use of these substances for spiritual growth.
- Cole-Turner issues a call for theologians and religious scholars to explore the tough questions posed by these drug-induced mystical states, including questions about the nature of religious experience, the relationship between brain chemistry and spiritual insight, and the long-term cultural impact of millions having these experiences via therapy or guided use.

## Tensions Between Materialist and Spiritual Interpretations
- He suggests that these experiences could spark a religious revival, a new syncretism, or a crisis of authority in churches, and that they may challenge the philosophy of mind, particularly the question of whether spiritual states are reducible to brain states or if the brain is a conduit to some greater reality.
- Cole-Turner invokes Huston Smith's notion that if these experiences are life-transforming and deeply similar to classical mysticism, theologians must wrestle with their implications, and that dismissing them as "fake" because they were chemically induced would be willful ignorance.
- He also considers the possibility that psychedelics could be a new "Galileo's telescope" that allows exploration of inner spiritual realms empirically, and that this could lead to the emergence of new doctrines or heresies, highlighting the need for theologians to take these experiences seriously and explore their implications.
- The discussion around the psychedelic renaissance is not only about its medical benefits, but also about its implications for spirituality in a scientific age, inviting a dialogue between scientific and religious communities, as highlighted by Cole-Turner's stance, which is sympathetic to the significance of psychedelic mysticism.
- Cole-Turner assumes that drug-induced psychedelic experiences are genuinely significant for spirituality and should not be dismissed as mere hallucinations, instead believing in a continuity between spontaneous mysticism and psychedelic mysticism, following Huston Smith's assertion that they are phenomenologically indistinguishable.
- This perspective is rooted in a quasi-perennial philosophy view, which posits that there is a universal "mystical experience" that can be achieved through various means, including prayer, fasting, or Psilocybin, and that this experience has a positive impact, such as healing and spiritual growth, which is a notion that nihiltheism would question as it may be just a lucky convergence.
- The idea that psychedelics can induce intense mystical experiences and treat disorders because of these experiences implies a purposeful design, as if evolution or providence hid medicine in these plants that heals by spiritual revelation, which is reminiscent of a providential perspective, but nihiltheism would argue that this may not be the case.
- Cole-Turner also assumes that more widespread mystical experiences would be a net positive culturally, foreseeing a beneficial deepening of spirituality or an awakening if psychedelics are integrated wisely, which is a hopeful teleology of progress, similar to Teilhard de Chardin's idea of evolving consciousness.
- However, this perspective has a hidden bias, as it does not entertain the thought that these experiences might be deceptive or lead people astray, and traditional theology might caution that not all "visions" are divine, which is a concern that nihiltheism would also raise, questioning the assumption that these experiences are inherently valuable.
- Additionally, Cole-Turner assumes that religion's survival and evolution are desirable, and that theologians have an obligation to engage with the topic of psychedelics, implying that religion needs to adapt rather than fade, which is a pro-Enlightenment stance that values the advancement of knowledge and ignores taboo, but nihiltheism would be wary of this teleology, arguing that revitalizing religion is only a "good" if one assumes religion has value.

## Psychedelics and the Transformation of Religious Institutions
- The author discusses the concept of opposition to new ideas as outdated dogmatism, referencing Galileo, and notes that Cole-Turner has a bias in favor of scientific openness, which is evident in his stance on the topic of psychedelics and spirituality.
- A notable tension exists between materialist explanation and spiritual interpretation, with Cole-Turner acknowledging that a skeptic could argue that spiritual experiences induced by Psilocybin are biochemically generated illusions, while also inviting theologians to consider the possibility of genuine contact with a greater reality.
- Cole-Turner's approach risks secularizing the sacred by bringing religion to the lab, and he is aware of the potential contradiction between religious institutions' traditional views on intoxication and their growing acceptance of psychedelics as pathways to spiritual experience.
- The idea of a "psychedelic chaplain" in a conventional church may seem heretical to some, and Cole-Turner implies that this tension can be navigated, but it poses a deep challenge to traditional theology, particularly in regards to the concept of salvation and the role of substances in spiritual experience.
- The use of psychedelics in a religious context may lead to a more mystical and less dogmatic approach to spirituality, but it also risks undermining established meaning structures and leading to a kind of spiritual nihilism, where traditional symbols and narratives lose power and are replaced by individualistic and subjective experiences.
- Cole-Turner notes that some religious individuals find their psychedelic experiences to be compatible with their faith, but this can also lead to monistic or syncretic interpretations that may contradict orthodox views, potentially causing existential crises within religions.
- The author also highlights the subtle contradiction between the objective nature of scientific discoveries, such as those made by Galileo, and the subjective nature of mystical experiences induced by psychedelics, which may not be considered "facts" in the same way, and Cole-Turner's argument that the consistency and impact of these experiences make them a kind of fact about human spirituality.
- The concept of optimism presented by Cole-Turner intersects with various philosophical traditions, including existentialist theology, as seen in the work of Tillich, and mysticism, as represented by Eckhart, where the idea of encountering a "God above God" requires confronting the "God is dead" moment, which can be facilitated by psychedelic experiences.
- The use of psychedelics can induce a sense of ontological shock, where one's previous notions of God are revealed to be inadequate, and a wordless presence or unity beyond them is experienced, verifying Tillich's concept that true faith often arises after the old certainties break.
- Cole-Turner's call to integrate this new source of existential insight into theology is somewhat similar to Tillich's perspective, and it also resonates with Nishitani's perspective, who would likely say that if psychedelics are giving people a taste of sunyata, or nothingness that is fullness, Western theology should pay attention, but with caution to avoid misconstruing emptiness as just another experience.

## Nihiltheistic Theology and the Ground of Being
- The idea of considering the cultural impact of psychedelics aligns with the perspective of William James, who would likely delight in the data as evidence for his claim that mystical states have authority for the people who experience them, and Cole-Turner seems to be on the side of taking these experiences seriously as possibly genuine.
- A 21st-century nihiltheistic theology, as an extension of Cole-Turner's agenda, would acknowledge the ungroundedness of all religious symbols, yet still seek the ground of being in the ungrounded, and propose that God or Ultimate Reality is accessible through the breakdown of all meaning frameworks, which psychedelics can facilitate, similar to the goals of apophatic mystics.
- This nihiltheistic theology might assert that psychedelic experiences are not literally God speaking, but rather the brain's encounter with the Nothingness that is the ground of everything, and in that encounter, we find a freedom and creativity akin to the divine, reframing God as not a being, but the condition of meaning's possibility in meaninglessness, a concept that flirts with Tillich and Mahayana Buddhism.
- Practically, religious communities might develop rituals around psychedelics that emphasize discernment, teaching people to treat the vivid imagery generated by these experiences as symbols, rather than literal revelations, and to approach them as experiential parables, neither dismissing the experience nor fully literalizing it.
- The integration of psychedelics into religious practices could lead to a more mystical and less dogmatic approach, or it could result in individuals creating their own personal spiritualities outside of traditional institutions, with both possibilities likely occurring in different contexts.
- Future research in theology could explore questions such as developing a sacramental view of psychedelics that is ethically responsible, distinguishing between genuine spiritual insights and delusions during psychedelic experiences, and re-examining traditional religious texts in light of psychedelic phenomena.
- Theologians like Cole-Turner may re-read their traditions in the context of psychedelic experiences, potentially legitimizing modern psychedelic visions or normalizing ancient religious experiences as similar to psychedelic ones, which could be seen as subversive and implying that prophets' visions may have been naturally occurring.
- A nihiltheist scholar, on the other hand, might highlight the contingency of religious forms and the idea that doctrines are post-hoc interpretations of neuro-spiritual events, leading to a more existential faith that values the transformational process itself, which could be referred to as grace or self-actualization.
- Potential research paths in bridging theology and psychedelic science include qualitative studies of people who integrate psychedelic experiences into their existing faith, examining how they reinterpret their faith's tenets and whether they become more pluralistic, as well as studying individuals with no spiritual background who adopt spiritual outlooks after psychedelic therapy.
- Theology as an academic field would need to account for the lived changes resulting from psychedelic experiences, potentially expanding the definition of religiosity to include new forms, and a nihiltheistic framework could be developed to evaluate psychedelic spiritual claims based on their consistency, ethical fruits, and existential livability.

## Cavallarin & Van Eyghen's Analysis of Psychedelics and Religion
- Ultimately, the conversation between theology and psychedelic science, as heralded by Cole-Turner, could lead to a more existentially grounded spirituality that acknowledges the biochemical contingency of human experiences while reaching towards values and meanings that people choose to hold sacred, and a nihiltheistic metaphysics might suggest that reality has a malleable interface with consciousness, allowing for multiple descriptions of the "Thing-in-itself".
- The essay by Alberto Cavallarin and Hans van Eyghen, titled "Psychedelics and Religion – Compatibility and Complexity", explores the complex relationship between psychedelics and religion, noting that while there is a growing interest in psychedelics in science, therapy, and the humanities, the intersection with theology and philosophy of religion remains underexplored.
- The authors acknowledge the historical tension between psychedelics and institutional religion, citing how many pre-Christian and indigenous religions used psychoactive plants in spiritual contexts, but with the advent of Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism, the use of psychedelics was often repressed or frowned upon, with Christian leaders supporting the War on Drugs and other faiths having prohibitions against intoxication.
- Despite this historical tension, Cavallarin and Van Eyghen emphasize that psychedelic experiences have much in common with classical religious mysticism, as they can dissolve ordinary ego boundaries and yield feelings of interconnectedness with others, nature, and the cosmos, which are hallmarks of mystical experiences achieved through meditation, prayer, and fasting.
- The authors discuss the consequences of the democratization of mystical experiences through psychedelics, including the potential undermining of religious hierarchies, as individuals can now access these experiences without the need for a religious "middleman" or lifelong ascetic practice, and the promotion of more "horizontal" thinking, which can erode dogmatism and top-down authority.
- Cavallarin and Van Eyghen note that psychedelic mysticism seems to encourage broad-mindedness and tolerance, citing examples of contemporary Christians, Sufi Muslims, and Buddhists who find parallels between psychedelic and meditative experiences, and suggest that psychedelics could support values many religions espouse, such as communal approaches, environmental reverence, and introspection.
- However, the authors caution that psychedelics rarely leave religion unchanged, as users often become syncretic, open to mixing elements from various traditions, and tend towards a monistic outlook, which can challenge traditional doctrines and push religions towards more pluralistic or New Agey territory.
- The essay also highlights complexities beyond mysticism, noting that some scholars worry that focusing only on mystical unity in research overlooks other common psychedelic phenomena, such as encounters with seemingly autonomous entities, which raises new questions about the meaning of these experiences for our understanding of consciousness and the cosmos.
- The authors, Cavallarin & Van Eyghen, criticize the "psychedelic cure-all" mentality, stating that psychedelics are not magical panaceas, but rather increase neuroplasticity and can be misused, as seen in scenarios where individuals develop grandiose or messianic delusions after taking psychedelics.
- The Good Friday Experiment is cited as an example, where one participant developed a messianic delusion, highlighting the potential for psychedelic-induced revelations to lead to heterodox claims that mimic religious delusions, and emphasizing the importance of research into psychedelics for religion scholars.

## Complexities and Risks of Psychedelic Spiritual Integration
- The authors conclude that psychedelics can be a disruptive yet illuminating mirror for religion, revealing both convergence and potential divergence, and invite a nuanced view, where psychedelics can both undermine dogma and inspire new spiritual synthesis, requiring thoughtful engagement with these outcomes.
- The essay has an underlying assumption that religious experience is a fundamental human phenomenon that can occur with or without institutional frameworks, and the authors seem to value the mystical, universal aspects of religion, such as interconnectedness, tolerance, and direct experience, while implicitly critiquing the hierarchical, dogmatic aspects.
- The authors also assume that individual spiritual autonomy is valuable, as suggested by their phrasing "why ask a priest...when you can meet God from the comfort of your backyard", and imply a teleology of moral improvement, listing values like universalism, tolerance, environmentalism, and peace, which they suggest psychedelics can assist religions to move towards.
- Additionally, the authors assume that syncretism and openness are likely outcomes of psychedelic experiences, and view them as neutral or positive, rather than negative, and believe that "responsible use" of psychedelics is possible and compatible with religions if it fosters core values, taking an optimistic view that these experiences can be integrated without dissolving all religious structure.
- The authors' perspective is relativistic or pluralistic, assuming no one tradition has a monopoly on truth, and they do not moralize syncretism as "heresy", instead framing it as an inclination attributable to the similarity of experiences across traditions, and highlighting the importance of thoughtful engagement with these outcomes to fully understand their nature, meaning, and consequences.
- The authors of the document "Mysticism, Psychedelics, and Nihiltheism" emphasize the importance of context and mindset in determining the outcomes of psychedelic experiences, suggesting that with the right approach, individuals can achieve positive outcomes such as universal love, rather than negative ones like delusions.
- They acknowledge the potential risks of psychedelic experiences, including the development of a God complex or messiah delusion, but frame these as warnings rather than inevitabilities, implying that careful guidance and framing can mitigate these risks.
- The authors appear to have a subtle bias towards a humanistic vision of religion, prioritizing personal experience and ethical fruits over doctrinal purity, and suggest that religion may evolve with the use of psychedelics to become more communal and less hierarchical.
- A major tension identified by the authors is that psychedelic experiences can both affirm and subvert religion, deepening one's appreciation of their faith while also potentially leading to a more universal or pantheistic perspective that challenges orthodox tenets.
- The authors note that this tension can lead to existential crises for believers, who must navigate the conflict between loyalty to their tradition and the universality of their mystical insights, potentially leading to reinterpretation of their tradition, identity crises, or conflict with their community.

## Entity Encounters and Philosophical Implications
- The authors also allude to the risk of persecution, citing the historical example of Sufi mystics, and note that some psychedelic-influenced new religious movements can become dogmatic, highlighting the potential for psychedelics to create new hierarchies or forms of dogmatism.
- Additionally, the authors mention the risk of entity encounters, such as meeting "Machine elves" on DMT, which can complicate the narrative of unity and monism, potentially leading to a kind of neo-animism or "techno-pantheon" belief, and highlighting the need for monistic interpretations to account for these experiences.
- The authors' discussion of these tensions and contradictions suggests that the relationship between psychedelics and religion is complex and multifaceted, and that the use of psychedelics can both challenge and transform traditional religious beliefs and practices.
- The concept of mysticism and psychedelics raises questions about the nature of ultimate reality, with some experiences suggesting a unified, impersonal Oneness, while others involve encounters with entities or beings, such as machine elves or personal spirit guides, which can be seen as a tension between the experience of no-self/unity and the experience of the radically Other.
- The authors highlight the complexity of these experiences, which can lead to existential confusion and prompt individuals to either choose one interpretation or form a hybrid belief, such as the idea that all gods and beings are manifestations of the One, a common reconciliation in many spiritual traditions.
- The ideas presented in the text resonate with the philosophical perspectives of medieval mystic Eckhart, who preached the "spark of the soul" in each person, and Søren Kierkegaard, who emphasized the importance of suffering and earnest spiritual struggle, but might be critical of the use of psychedelics as a quick route to spiritual experience, questioning the sincerity and ethical development of individuals who rely on these substances.
- The text also references the nihilistic perspective of Cioran, who would likely view the use of psychedelics as a means to accelerate the revelation of the absurdity and syncretic nature of human spirituality, leading to a form of meta-nihilism, where all spiritual systems are seen as human constructs to be mixed and matched, with no privileged grip on truth.
- The authors suggest that the use of psychedelics can lead to a sense of syncretic nihiltheism, where individuals incorporate bits of many traditions into their spiritual practice, and that this phenomenon may be evidence of a transcendent reality plus human interpretative diversity model, where the divine is seen as a mirror reflecting whatever the individual brings to the experience.
- The text concludes by inviting consideration of the future of religion, possibly involving the rise of "psychedelic spirituality" as a distinct movement or the infusion of psychedelic experiences into existing religions, leading to new forms of spiritual expression and evolution.
- The authors suggest that future denominations or sub-groups may emerge that allow or even sacramentalize psychedelic use, potentially leading to a nihiltheist approach that encourages critical syncretism, which involves intentionally blending traditions while acknowledging that one is doing so to create meaning, not to assert an absolute.

## Syncretic Nihiltheism and Future Spiritual Frameworks
- This approach, referred to as Syncretic Nihiltheism, involves embracing multiple symbols and traditions while holding them lightly, recognizing that they are languages for the same unspeakable reality, and that none of them are ultimately true, instead pointing to an emptiness or fullness that justifies none of them completely.
- The authors also discuss the entity problem, where encounters with entities during psychedelic experiences could be treated as a new kind of phenomenological data, forcing an expansion of theory, and potentially leading to new philosophical perspectives, such as idealism or panpsychism, as argued by philosophers like Bernardo Kastrup.
- Future research could involve inter-subjective entity encounters, where multiple people undergo psychedelic experiences together and compare their experiences, which could challenge materialist assumptions if consistent results are obtained, and scholars like Cavallarin & Van Eyghen suggest that these experiences should be treated with caution to avoid birthing new cultish beliefs.
- The authors emphasize the need for a balanced approach, recognizing that psychedelics can transform religiosity in a liberalizing way, but also raising questions about preserving meaning and avoiding existential drift, and they suggest that nihiltheism can provide a framework for embracing the liberation from rigid meaning while urging mindful creation of new, flexible meanings.
- The authors propose potential paths for future research, including comparative theology, which could involve studying how different frameworks, such as Buddhist or Christianity, interpret psychedelic experiences, and ethics of psychedelic spirituality, which could involve ensuring that the undermining of hierarchy does not lead to anarchy or vulnerable people being misled by self-proclaimed shamans.
- The authors conclude that their piece maps a balanced view, recognizing the potential of psychedelics to transform religiosity, but also emphasizing the need for scholars of religion to be involved in order to add ethical and anthropological insight, and to ensure that the transformation of religiosity is done in a way that preserves meaning and avoids existential drift.
- The exploration of the intersection of mysticism, medicine, and meaning reveals a rapidly evolving discourse, with empirical research confirming that psychedelics can ignite experiences of profound meaningfulness, unity, and sacredness, but also destabilize individuals and expose the groundlessness of all beliefs.
- The use of psychedelics simultaneously uncovers the void beneath meaning, highlighting a central paradox, and a Nihiltheistic lens forces us to hold both truths: that people report encountering what they describe as God, ultimate unity, or transcendence, but these are mind-mediated phenomena whose interpretation is contingent and ungrounded in any verifiable absolutes.
- The examination of various sources reveals hidden assumptions and covert teleologies, including the implicit narrative of redemption that psychedelics will heal trauma, cure addiction, and rekindle spiritual fervor, which Nihiltheism warns can become new dogmas if left unexamined.
- Concerns are raised that researchers may impose their theological residues onto science, and that the mysticism construct may become a black box that evades critical scrutiny, prompting some to argue for a fully demystified approach, reducing these events to brain-based "peak experiences".

## Interdisciplinary Research and Ethical Considerations
- The engagement with existentialist and mystical traditions, including the works of Søren Kierkegaard, Meister Eckhart, Paul Tillich, Nishitani, Albert Camus, and Cioran, enriches the critique and highlights the complexities and ironies of direct experience, the authenticity of chemically induced conversion, and the parallels between grace and pharmacology.
- The concept of ontological shock, as described by Paul Tillich, is particularly relevant, as psychedelics can rip away one's finitudes, confronting individuals with the "threat of non-being" that can lead to new courage to be or to despair, and the insights into nihilism and emptiness by Nishitani highlight the potential for nihilistic collapse or a breakthrough into a more authentic mode of being.
- The examination of the experiences of participants who navigated the abyss often reveals a renewed appreciation for life's immediacy, reminiscent of Camus's Sisyphus finding joy in the very struggle, but also raises questions about the livability of new-found sacredness and the nothingness underlying it, and the potential for the radiance to fade, requiring integration or another "dose" of transcendence.
- The Nihiltheistic method is used to approach mystical and psychedelic experiences with ontological honesty, acknowledging that these experiences are subjectively real and significant, while also recognizing that their interpretation is a creative and ethical responsibility.
- This approach encourages individuals to maximize the growth from mystical states, such as empathy, purpose, and joy, without solidifying metaphysical assumptions, and to recognize the paradox that an experience can feel divinely significant while still being ungrounded.
- The concept of "Null Mysticism" is introduced, where the highest revelation is the embrace of nothingness, which can be a therapeutic insight that teaches resilience without false comfort, and "laboratory-validated nihilism" is proposed, which uses scientific means to induce states that reveal the constructed nature of meaning.
- The idea of "Secular Mysticism" and "mysticism of nothingness" is also explored as frameworks to study and integrate these phenomena without supernatural claims, and a nihiltheistic theology is suggested, which would see psychedelics as tools that highlight the ungrounded ground of faith, potentially revitalizing religion.
- Practical innovations, such as existential safety nets and the role of psychedelic chaplains or guides, are proposed to help individuals interpret their experiences in a way that fosters personal growth without delusion, and the importance of conscious framing and narrative is emphasized in shaping the outcome of these experiences.
- Future research paths are identified, including longitudinal studies on the long-term integration and worldview change of individuals who have had psychedelic mystical experiences, comparative frameworks that compare different interpretive sets and settings, and the dialogue between neuroscience and mysticism to differentiate between "unitary experience" and "entity encounter" patterns.
- The Nihiltheistic approach advocates for frameworks that are explicit about the "as if" nature of the narratives adopted, acknowledging that individuals choose to view an experience in a certain way for its beneficial effect, while being aware that other framings are possible, and this approach can help individuals choose their values more freely and cultivate a more open-hearted and pluralistic worldview.

## Conclusion and Future Directions
- The research on psychedelics and mysticism can be grounded in scientific data that correlates specific neural signatures with phenomenological experiences, such as the suppression of the default mode network with unity or temporal lobe activation with sensed presences, to refine mind-brain-reality models.
- Investigating the ethical and existential outcomes of psychedelic experiences is crucial, including changes in values and behavior, such as increased compassion, altruism, and a sense of purpose, which can be measured using new instruments or mixed-method approaches to gauge existential fulfillment or authenticity.
- To prevent the reification of psychedelic insights into harmful dogmas, risk mitigation strategies can be developed, such as studying cases of psychedelic-induced delusions, training facilitators to recognize warning signs, and gently helping individuals reframe their insights in a constructive manner.
- Interdisciplinary dialogues between neuroscientists, therapists, philosophers, and theologians can facilitate a deeper understanding of the nuances of meaning in psychedelic experiences, and encourage collaboration through symposia or edited volumes, such as "Sacredness and Void: Psychedelic Science meets Existential Philosophy".
- The guiding principle in this research should be radical openness and radical skepticism in balance, which is at the heart of Nihiltheism, allowing for the possibility that these experiences tap into aspects of consciousness or reality that challenge current paradigms, while being skeptical of any final claims to truth that emerge.
- Ultimately, the intersection of psychedelics, mysticism, and nihilism raises the ancient question of whether we can find meaning while knowing that we ourselves are the makers of meaning, and the truth may be that by projecting meaning onto the void, we create a meaning that is real enough to live by, leading to a more humble and flexible understanding of the sacred.
- The concept of Nihiltheism provides a unique perspective on mysticism and psychedelic experiences, allowing individuals to approach these experiences with a sense of groundlessness and uncertainty, yet still find meaning and significance in them.
- By embracing the radical insights of Nihiltheism, individuals can venture into mystic Frontiers Media with "eyes wide open," being lucid in their wonder and honest in their not-knowing, which can transform their experiences into authentic catalysts for human growth.
- Research has shown that Psilocybin, a psychedelic substance, can occasion mystical-type experiences that have substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance, with studies published on platforms such as PubMed and ResearchGate supporting this claim.
- Various publications, including The New Yorker and Frontiers, have explored the relationship between psychedelics, mystical experience, and therapeutic efficacy, highlighting the complex and multifaceted nature of this topic.
- The intersection of psychedelics and religion is also a complex and nuanced issue, with some studies suggesting that psychedelic experiences can lead to increased spiritual significance and personal meaning, while others highlight the potential risks and challenges associated with navigating ontological shock and existential distress following these experiences.
- Scholars and researchers, such as those cited in the provided links, are continuing to explore and discuss the implications of psychedelics and mysticism on human growth, spirituality, and our understanding of the world, with many calling for a more nuanced and informed approach to these topics.
