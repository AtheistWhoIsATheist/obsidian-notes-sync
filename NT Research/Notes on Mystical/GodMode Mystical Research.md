## THOUGHTS

I have identified several relevant sources from the Google search results. The next step is to compile a list of these key entities and then create a downloadable .txt file containing this list.

## REASONING

Compiling a list of key entities will help organize the information and make it easier to create the .txt file. By summarizing the key details of each source, I can ensure that the list is informative and useful.
