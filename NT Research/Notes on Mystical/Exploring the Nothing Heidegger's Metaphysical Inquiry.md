Martin Heidegger's essay "The Nothing" and Inaugural Lecture "What Is Metaphysics?"

Heidegger's essay and lecture discuss the concept of the nothing and its relationship to being.

The "nothing" is not a being, but rather the absence of being, and it is essential to the Being of beings.

Anxiety is a fundamental mode of human existence that reveals the nothing.

The nothing is a phenomenon that can be experienced directly, not just a concept.

It is not a matter of logic, but rather of the experience of the world.

The nothing is a mystery to be explored, not a problem to be solved.

A new approach to the question of the nothing is needed, one that is not bound by logic or intellect.

  

### The Concept of Nothing in Heidegger's Inaugural Lecture

Heidegger distinguishes the nothing from nothingness, which is a specific lack of being. Anxiety is a fundamental mood that reveals the nothing.

Anxiety is distinct from fear, as it arises from the prospect of nothingness.

Anxiety reveals the nothing by nihilating all beings as a whole.

Science's attempts to understand the nothing are often hindered by its own assumptions and methods.

The concept of the nothing is central to metaphysics, the study of the fundamental nature of reality.

The Question of the Nothing in Metaphysics

The nothing is encountered in anxiety as the groundless ground of Dasein.

It is the essential impossibility of determining it and brings Dasein before beings as such.

The nothing is the complete negation of the totality of beings.

It is not a transitory epiphenomenon of thinking and willing behavior.

The nothing is a source of unyielding antagonism and requires a deeper answer.

Scientific existence relates to beings in a distinctive way and holds itself out into the nothing.

Metaphysics and the Question of the Nothing

Metaphysics is the study of the fundamental nature of reality.

  

The question of the nothing is a fundamental question in metaphysics.

It has been the subject of much debate and speculation.

The question of the nothing is difficult to answer.

The concept of transcendence is related to the question of the nothing. Transcendence is essential to the study of metaphysics but difficult to understand. The concept of the finite is also related to the question of the nothing.
