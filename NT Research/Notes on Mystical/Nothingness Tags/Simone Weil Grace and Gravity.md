# Detailed Briefing: Simone Weil's "Gravity and Grace" – Key Themes and Concepts

This briefing document reviews the core philosophical and spiritual themes found in Simone Weil's "Gravity and Grace," a collection of her aphorisms, observations, and reflections. Compiled and introduced by Gustave Thibon, the text explores the human condition, the nature of good and evil, the role of suffering, the imperative of self-annihilation, and a critical perspective on social order. Weil's insights, often paradoxical and challenging, aim to guide individuals toward a profound and authentic connection with the divine, emphasizing detachment from worldly illusions and an embrace of spiritual reality.

## I. The Nature of the Self and the Imperative of "Decreation"

Weil posits the "Self" or "I" as the central obstacle to spiritual truth and union with God, presenting its destruction as the only truly free act a human can accomplish.

- **The Self as Illusion and Barrier:** The "Self" is described as "that shadow thrown by sin and error which stops the light of God and which we take for a being" \[New Source 2, 2, 3\]. It is rooted in human "wretchedness," and our natural state is seen as an "inverted" one, living in sin \[New Source 2, 4, 5\]. The "Self" acts as a "screen" preventing true contact with God and creation \[New Source 2, 8, 9\].
- **Imitation of God's Renunciation:** Weil advocates for "decreation," a process of "making something created pass into the uncreated" \[New Source 2, 7\]. This mirrors God's act of creation, where He "consented through love to cease to be everything so that we might be something." In turn, humans must "consent through love to cease to be anything so that God may become everything again" \[New Source 2, 6, 10, 18\]. All good in us is a "loan" from outside; anything "appropriated" by the "I" loses its value \[New Source 2, 12\].
- **Methods of Self-Destruction:Internal Destruction (Grace and Love):** This redemptive path involves refusing "violent revolt" against external pressures, leading to the "I"'s destruction from within \[New Source 2, 17\]. Key practices include:
- **Humility:** The "knowledge that we are nothing as human beings or as creatures" and "the refusal to exist outside God" \[New Source 2, 3, 19\].
- **Attention:** "Absolutely unmixed attention" is equated with prayer and is the "creative faculty in man." When "so full that the 'I' disappears," it leads to self-liberation \[New Source 2, 20, 21\].
- **Renunciation:** Giving up the past and future, as the "Self" is a "coagulation of past and future around a present which is always falling away" \[New Source 2, 22, 23\]. It also means accepting a "void" within oneself, a supernatural act allowing grace to enter \[New Source 2, 24, 25\].
- **Love:** Supernatural love is the ultimate force for internal destruction of the "Self." "Perfect joy excludes even the very feeling of joy, for in the soul filled by the object no corner is left for saying ‘I’" \[New Source 2, 26, 27\].
- **External Destruction (Affliction):** When the "I" is destroyed "from outside" by extreme suffering, it results in "quasi-infernal suffering," which is worse than voluntary decreation because the individual can no longer destroy it themselves \[New Source 2, 1, 28\]. This can lead to a "naked, vegetative egoism," reducing the being to a "hideous" state where survival is the only attachment \[New Source 2, 17, 29\]. This type of destruction is "irreparable" because it "prevents God from effecting the destruction himself and robs eternalizing love of its prey" \[New Source 2, 26\].

## II. The Profound Nature of Human Affliction

Weil views affliction as a unique and extreme form of suffering that is fundamental to human existence and spiritual growth, distinguishing it from mere pain.

- **Characteristics of Affliction:** Affliction is "an extreme degree of suffering that goes beyond the realm of pity," often eliciting "disgust, horror, and scorn" \[New Source 3, 1\]. It is inherently "bitter and unwelcome," placing a human being "beneath pity" \[New Source 3, 1\]. Its "unendurability" stems from its ability to arrest thought's natural flow, "lacerating" one's sense of time \[New Source 3, 4\].
- **Affliction and the "I":** Extreme affliction can destroy the "I" from outside, leading to "quasi-infernal suffering" and a "naked, vegetative egoism" \[New Source 3, 6, 9, 10\]. This leaves individuals in a state of "complete uprooting," losing their "clothing of character" \[New Source 3, 11\].
- **Affliction as God's Absence/Mercy:** Paradoxically, affliction is a manifestation of God's love. God "withdraws" from us so we can love Him, and this "absence of God" is the "mode of divine presence which corresponds to evil" \[New Source 3, 8, 12\]. Weil radically asserts that "Evil is the form which God’s mercy takes in this world" and that the world, "when completely empty of God, is God himself" \[New Source 3, 14, 15\]. The hardships we face are a "screen" to be "pierced through" to reconnect with the divine \[New Source 3, 12\].
- **Role in Purification and Knowledge:** Affliction is a crucial path to purification:
- **Detachment:** "Unconsoled affliction" is necessary for "total detachment," exposing the misery of attachment \[New Source 3, 16, 17\]. "Suffering that does not detach us is wasted suffering" \[New Source 3, 18\].
- **Knowledge of Misery:** It "opens to them the knowledge of human misery, knowledge which is the door of all wisdom" \[New Source 3, 19\]. It forces one to confront reality without illusion, recognizing what was previously thought impossible \[New Source 3, 20\].
- **Redemptive Suffering:** In a "perfect soul" emptied of self through love, affliction produces the "absence of God," known as "redemptive suffering" \[New Source 3, 7, 8\]. This is exemplified by Christ's cry on the cross, making "God present in extreme evil" \[New Source 3, 7, 22\].
- **Acceptance of the Void:** True deliverance from affliction requires accepting the "void" it creates, refusing "consolations" or "imagination" \[New Source 3, 27, 28\]. This acceptance is supernatural and allows grace to enter, for the "void is the supreme fullness" \[New Source 3, 29\].

## III. Radical Vision of Divine Mercy

Weil's concept of Divine Mercy is profound and often counter-intuitive, deeply linked to suffering, God's apparent absence, and the "decreation" of the self.

- **God's Self-Effacement and Withdrawal:** Creation itself is an act of divine mercy, as God "gave up being everything" to allow creatures to exist \[New Source 4, 6\]. This "absence of God" is a deliberate act of love, enabling free, supernatural love from humanity \[New Source 4, 5, 9, 10\]. The "complete absence of mercy here below" is paradoxically "evidence of divine mercy" \[New Source 4, 7\].
- **Evil as a Form of Divine Mercy:** Most strikingly, Weil asserts, "Evil is the form which the mercy of God takes in this world" \[New Source 4, 1\]. The dissatisfaction inherent in created things, their refusal to be ultimate ends, is God's "extreme mercy," preventing us from settling for anything less than God \[New Source 4, 1, 14\]. To "love God through evil as such" is a pure act of love \[New Source 4, 11\].
- **Grace and the "Void":** Grace is the means of escape from the "gravity" of the self, working by "decreating" us \[New Source 4, 2\]. Grace needs a "void" within the soul to enter, and "it is grace itself which makes this void" \[New Source 4, 16\]. All sins are attempts to "fill voids" \[New Source 4, 17\].
- **Suffering as an Instrument of Mercy:** Suffering, particularly "unconsoled affliction," is necessary for total detachment and is a means for the "self" to be "destroyed from without" \[New Source 4, 20, 25\]. For a perfected soul, this leads to "redemptive suffering," making "God present in extreme evil" \[New Source 4, 4, 22\]. Christianity, for Weil, offers not a "supernatural cure for suffering, but a supernatural use for it" \[New Source 4, 23\].
- **The Cross and Incarnation:** The "mystery of suffering and decreation" centers on the Incarnation \[New Source 4, 3\]. Christ's cry on the cross, "My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?" is the "real proof that Christianity is something divine," embodying an "abyss of love on both sides" \[New Source 4, 27\]. The Cross symbolizes the "infinite thickness of time and space" God traverses to reach the soul, and the soul must traverse to reach God, representing "infinite perfection \[as\] infinite weakness" \[New Source 4, 29, 9\].

## IV. Critique of Social Order and the "Great Beast"

Weil's perspective on social order is profoundly critical, viewing it as inherently flawed, prone to idolatry, and a potential impediment to individual spiritual development.

- **The Nature of Social Order:** The social order is "irreducibly that of the prince of this world," meaning it is inherently earthly and flawed, disconnected from the divine \[New Source 1, 7; New Source 5, The Great Beast, 165\]. The only duty regarding the social is to "try and limit the evil within it" \[New Source 1, 7\].
- **The "Great Beast" – Social Idolatry:** A central concept is Plato's "Great Beast," symbolizing the collective soul or totalitarian city \[New Source 1, 9\]. This collective is the _only_ object of idolatry and the _only_ "ersatz" (substitute) for God \[New Source 1, 12, 13; New Source 5, The Great Beast, 164\]. Adoring it means conforming to the "prejudices and reactions of the multitude at the expense of one's personal search for truth and goodness" \[New Source 1, 10; New Source 5, The Great Beast, 164\]. This idolatry, whether conservative or revolutionary, "tends to stifle and replace true mystical tradition" \[New Source 1, 14\].
- **Historical Examples:Rome:** Described as "the Great Beast of atheism and materialism, adoring nothing but itself" \[New Source 1, 15, 16; New Source 5, The Great Beast, 166\].
- **Israel:** Viewed as the "Great Beast of religion" \[New Source 1, 15, 16; New Source 5, The Great Beast, 166\]. Weil believed its God, though immaterial, was conceived as a "temporal sovereign akin to an Emperor," leading to a "collective, national, and carnal religion rather than a personal, spiritual one" \[New Source 1, 21, 22\]. She links the "curse of Israel" to historical atrocities like the Inquisition, and to capitalism and totalitarianism \[New Source 1, 23, 24; New Source 5, Israel, 159\].
- **Marxism:** Criticized as containing the "essence of Plato's 'Great Beast'" and a "very degraded and completely warped view" of a wrong union of contraries, leading to "the imperialism of the working class" \[New Source 1, 11, 15, 25, 26; New Source 5, The Great Beast, 167\]. She dismisses the Marxist belief in progress as contrary to scientific principles like the law of entropy \[New Source 1, 27; New Source 5, Social Harmony, 174\].
- **The Church:** Even the Catholic Church is critiqued as a social body due to its historical ties to Jewish and Roman sources, its organization, hierarchy, and certain historical events (e.g., the Inquisition), viewing these as forms of "social idolatry," albeit of a "higher order" \[New Source 1, 7, 28, 29; New Source 5, introduction, xxx\]. However, she maintained belief in the Church's "divine presence" and an "incorruptible core of truth" \[New Source 1, 28, 29; New Source 5, introduction, xxxvii\].
- **Social Influence: "Food and Poison":** Social influence can provide "food" (inner equipment for human life, roots, traditions, culture) or "poison" (robbing liberty and taking God's place) \[New Source 1, 8, 17; New Source 5, introduction, xxxvi\]. These "relative and mixed blessings" are "metaxu," bridges to God that can become idols if not treated as intermediaries \[New Source 1, 18-20; New Source 5, Metaxu, 146\].
- **The Individual and the Social:** For Weil, "The self and the social are the two great idols" \[New Source 1, 30; New Source 5, introduction, xxxviii; New Source 5, The Great Beast, 169\]. Natural man is a slave, controlled by "alien wills" \[New Source 1, 31\]. Dependence (slave or master) debases the spirit, leading to "servility or tyranny" \[New Source 1, 32, 33; New Source 5, The Social Imprint, 154\]. True dignity under compulsion lies in seeing the "chief as a thing," recognizing "every man is a slave of necessity, but a conscious slave is superior" \[New Source 1, 35; New Source 5, The Social Imprint, 157\].
- **Limiting Social Evil and Achieving Balance:** Since social order is inherently flawed, a "supernatural soul" must "ceaselessly try to restore balance by siding with the defeated and oppressed" \[New Source 1, 36; New Source 5, introduction, xvi-xvii\]. Social order is an "equilibrium of forces." If unbalanced, one must "add weight to the lighter side," even using "evil" to achieve equilibrium, requiring a clear "conception of equilibrium" and a readiness to "change sides like Justice—that fugitive from the camp of conquerors" \[New Source 1, 37, 38; New Source 5, Social Harmony, 171\].
- **Legitimacy and the Past:** A well-ordered society has a state with "only negative action, like a rudder maintaining equilibrium" \[New Source 1, 39; New Source 5, Social Harmony, 172\]. Legitimacy, embodied in laws and supreme power, is the "supernatural element in society," representing "continuity, permanence, and unchanging principles" that compel men to "wish for 'exactly that which is'" \[New Source 1, 40, 41; New Source 5, Social Harmony, 172-173\]. Uprootedness (break in legitimacy) leads to an obsession with "progress," which directs finality toward an imagined future instead of the eternal \[New Source 1, 41, 42\]. Renewal comes from the "past," which is "the most perfect image of eternal, supernatural reality" because it is real, beyond our reach, and can draw us upwards \[New Source 1, 43; New Source 5, Social Harmony, 175\].
- **Manual Work:** Weil sees manual work as a "mysticism of work" \[New Source 1, 44; New Source 5, The Mysticism of Work, 178\]. It's a profound way to experience the "absurdity of earthly life" where effort is for existence ("to work in order to eat, to eat in order to work") \[New Source 1, 45, 46\]. The "slave" labors with "no good...except mere existence" \[New Source 1, 46\]. This "effort without finality" is "terrible—or the most beautiful thing of all—if it is finality without an end" \[New Source 1, 47\]. Workers, "having nothing superfluous of which they have to strip themselves," are uniquely positioned for direct connection with God due to the absence of earthly finality \[New Source 1, 46\].

## V. Key Concepts and Underlying Principles

- **Gravity vs. Grace:** "All the natural movements of the soul are controlled by laws analogous to those of physical gravity. Grace is the only exception" \[New Source 5, Gravity and Grace, 1\]. Gravity pulls us down, towards self-assertion, while grace (divine intervention) enables ascent.
- **Void and Compensation:** Humans constantly try to "fill voids" to escape suffering or the recognition of their own nothingness \[New Source 5, Void and Compensation, 5; New Source 5, To Accept the Void, 10\]. True spiritual progress requires "to endure the void" and "accept death," as grace "fills empty spaces but it can only enter where there is a void to receive it, and it is grace itself which makes this void" \[New Source 5, To Accept the Void, 10, 11\].
- **Detachment:** Essential for spiritual growth, requiring "unconsoled affliction" and a refusal of "consolations" \[New Source 5, Detachment, 12\]. It means "to empty desire, finality of all content, to desire in the void, to desire without any wishes" \[New Source 5, Detachment, 13\].
- **Attention and Will:** Weil emphasizes attention over will in spiritual matters. "Absolutely unmixed attention is prayer" and is the "creative faculty in man" \[New Source 5, Attention and Will, 117\]. The will is for "servile tasks," while attention, when "so full that the 'I' disappears," leads to self-liberation and reception of grace \[New Source 5, Attention and Will, 117, 118\].
- **Contradiction:** "The contradictions the mind comes up against—these are the only realities: they are the criterion of the real" \[New Source 5, Contradiction, 98\]. Human life is inherently contradictory, reflecting our nature as "being God and infinitely other than God" \[New Source 5, The Impossible, 95\]. "Contradiction experienced to the very depths of the being tears us heart and soul: it is the cross" \[New Source 5, Contradiction, 98\].
- **The Cross:** The ultimate symbol of divine love, self-emptying, and the intersection of the finite and infinite. Christ's crucifixion represents "the existence of perfect justice without any admixture of appearance," making "God present in extreme evil" through "redemptive suffering" \[New Source 5, The Cross, 89, 90\].
- **Truth and Reality:** True reality is only perceptible through "total detachment" from the "Self" \[New Source 5, Detachment, 14\]. "To love truth means to endure the void and, as a result, to accept death" \[New Source 5, To Accept the Void, 11\]. "A test of what is real is that it is hard and rough" \[New Source 5, Illusions, 53\].
- **Evil:** "Evil is limitless but it is not infinite" \[New Source 5, Evil, 69\]. It is "monotonous, barren, boring," and "imaginary" compared to the "always new, marvellous, intoxicating" real good \[New Source 5, Evil, 69-70\]. "Evil is the form which the mercy of God takes in this world" \[New Source 5, Evil, 69; New Source 5, Metaxu, 145\].

Weil's "Gravity and Grace" presents a coherent and challenging spiritual philosophy, urging individuals to confront their inherent limitations, embrace suffering as a path to purification, and ultimately, to dissolve the self in order to experience true reality and union with a God who is both infinitely present and infinitely absent
