1. **Growth of Inclination for Solitude**: "The love of solitude...cannot be considered otherwise than as an acquired taste; it must come as the result of experience and reflection... In middle age, it is not so difficult, while to the aged, solitude seems the natural element"​​.
2. **Leopardi's Solitude**: "On Leopardi: He wandered silently about the neighboring forests, seeking solitude not only for the sake of solitude but also perhaps for the suggestions, at once soothing and rebellious, which solitude always whispers to him who courts her truly"​​.
3. **Solitary Walks and Isolation**: "Nothing should detract attention from these phenomena of absolute isolation: a fearfully lucid intuition will reveal the entire drama of man's finite nature facing the infinite nothingness of the world. Solitary walks are propitious to an intense process of interiorization"​​.
4. **Need of Solitude as a Sign of Spirit**: "He often feels a need of solitude, which for him is a vital necessity -- sometimes like breathing, at other times like sleeping. The fact that he feels this vital necessity more than other men is also a sign that he has a deeper nature"​​.
5. **Isolation and the Sense of Nothingness**: "We are so isolated from everything! But isn't everything equally inaccessible to us? The deepest and most organic death is death in solitude, when even light becomes a principle of death. In such moments you will be severed from life, from love, smiles, friends and even from death"​​.
