# Descriptions of Mystical Experiences:

9/4/23 [[mystical]]

## Some Different Types-

### 1\. Numinous Experience: 

A numinous experience refers to a profound encounter with the divine or sacred. It involves a deep sense of awe, reverence, and humility in the presence of something greater than oneself. During a numinous experience, individuals may feel a strong connection to a higher power or a spiritual realm. This encounter often leaves individuals with a lasting impression of the divine and a deep sense of respect and reverence for it. 

  

### 2\. Unitive Experience: 

The unitive experience involves a sense of oneness or unity with all things. It is characterized by the dissolution of boundaries between the self and the external world. During this experience, individuals may feel a profound interconnectedness with nature, other people, or the entire universe. They perceive themselves as an integral part of a larger whole, experiencing a deep understanding of the interconnectivity and interdependence of all existence. This sense of unity often brings about feelings of love, compassion, and a profound recognition of the inherent value and sacredness of all life_._  The individual perceives a personal connection with a sacred other, but _the sense of self remains distinct from the divine presence._

  

### 3. Transcendent Experience: 

A transcendent mystical experience entails surpassing or transcending one's ordinary sense of self and entering into a state of expanded consciousness. It involves a profound shift in one's perception of reality and a sense of connection to a greater cosmic reality. _During a transcendent experience, individuals may feel a sense of timelessness, egolessness (ego death), and a deep connection to a universal or Divine essence._ These experiences often result in transformative insights and a profound shift in one's perspective on life and reality. They can bring about a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness and spiritual nature of existence. 

(Distinction between “Unitive” and “Transcendent”) = In transcendent experiences, _the distinction between the self and the transcendent dissolves, creating a sense of unity with the Divine, while the Unitive experience the sense of ‘self’ stays in tact as a “meeting with”, rather than a “oneness with”._
