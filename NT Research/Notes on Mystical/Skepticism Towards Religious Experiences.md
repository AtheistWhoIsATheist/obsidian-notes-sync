# Skepticism Towards Religious Experiences

[[2024-1-19]] 

- This revolves around the lack of justification that subjectivity has, except when it doesn’t, and can ‘justify’ all the most important aspects that literally shape the entirety of human existence, i.e. meaning, value, and purpose.

## Mem

Cultural skepticism or dismissal towards mystical experiences can take many forms, often influenced by the dominant scientific, religious, or philosophical paradigms of a society. Here are a few examples:

  

1\. **Scientific Materialism** : In cultures heavily influenced by scientific materialism, mystical experiences are often dismissed as hallucinations, delusions, or the result of chemical imbalances in the brain. They're seen as anomalies to be explained away, rather than meaningful experiences to be explored.

  

2\. **Religious Orthodoxy** : In some religious contexts, mystical experiences that don't align with established doctrines or traditions may be dismissed as heresy, delusion, or even demonic influence. This can be seen in various historical and contemporary instances where individuals claiming direct, personal experiences of the divine have been met with skepticism or outright hostility.

  

3\. **Secular Skepticism** : In secular or atheistic cultures, mystical experiences might be dismissed as wishful thinking, self-deception, or the result of psychological needs for meaning and comfort. They're often seen as irrational or unscientific, and thus not worthy of serious consideration.

  

4\. **Commercialization and Trivialization** : In some modern cultures, mystical experiences have been commercialized and trivialized, turned into commodities to be bought and sold. This can lead to a dismissal of their depth and significance, reducing them to mere entertainment or escapism.

  

5\. **Pathologization** : In some medical and psychological contexts, mystical experiences are pathologized, seen as symptoms of mental illness rather than potentially transformative experiences. This can lead to a dismissal of their potential value and a focus on eliminating or controlling them.

  

These are just a few examples, and the reality is often more complex, with multiple factors at play. _It's also worth noting that there are many counter-examples, where mystical experiences are valued and respected, even in cultures where skepticism is common._ (my emphasis)
