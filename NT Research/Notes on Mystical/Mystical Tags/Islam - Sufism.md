 • “The Conference of the Birds” by Farid ud-Din Attar: An allegorical poem that tells the story of birds’ quest for a king, symbolizing the soul’s quest for God. It delves into themes of self-surrender and the discovery of divine truth beyond the physical world.

 • “Futuh al-Ghaib” (Revelations of the Unseen) by Abdul Qadir Gilani: A collection of 78 discourses, offering insights into the spiritual path, the nature of God, and the soul’s journey towards union with the Divine, including the concept of dying before death as a metaphor for spiritual awakening.
