## Last Thing Before Bed

<br>

## Write Down What I Did for the Day

- [[Integrated Analytical Agent Frameworks]]
- [https://chat.openai.com/share/c5e544c7-3c6f-4dc4-8ccb-0e2000683a8b](https://chat.openai.com/share/c5e544c7-3c6f-4dc4-8ccb-0e2000683a8b)
- Formally write out this prompt structure tomorrow. 
    - "Two Part message (ended up being three), wait to respond:
        - 1st Psrt: " This is a two part message, \*\*do NOT RESPOND until after I sent the second part. Do you understand?Step.by step, in a iterative methodology, create & develop ten perfect prompts for deep dive philosophical exploration & analysis into Nihiltheism, including and building off the "Perfect Prompt Method (PPM) criteria : [[Prompts/Prompt Generators-Enhancers/PPM/PPM]]
        - Step 2:  Enter [[Integrated Analytical Agent Frameworks]], ending with:  "If you understand so far, just say "yes". If you have a question, ask me now. If not, wait for the third and final message before responding."
        - Step 3 (send any relevant document with this step) Remember, these prompts are to be perfectly structured and written for a deep dive of philosophy, and particularly Nihiltheism. To reiterate, I need ten perfect prompts that meet the PPM criteria and include the four agent descriptions that are individually delimited by triple quotes in my previous message. The prompts need a \*\*call to action++, or in other words need to be deployable. So, if I feel that an answer or response to an inquiry of mine is not being satisfactorily met, I can deploy one of these Agents to help dive deeper into the specific issue. 
    - Out of the initial ten prompts, I will choose one, and this is the one we will begin our arduous task of iteratively enhancing and perfecting. Any questions? If not, let's begin with your initial ten prompts. Remember, these prompts are for deep dive exploration and analysts into Nihiltheism and its philosophical implications."

- [ ] **[[Psilocybin & Mystical/Transcendent Experiences]] Do these prompts!**

## Ideas in Progress  

### I Need to Keep Pursuing

- [x] Bard’s [[Philosopher's Laboratory]]Build [[Reversed Engineered Prompt Builder]]using, [[NT Research/Definitions/Key Concepts of Nihiltheism]], [[Simple\_Sum\_NT]], [[Simplified Summary 2]], [[Nihiltheism Q&A]]. For context to build a “\*Nihiltheistic Prompt Library\*”. [[Prompts/Superprompt/Fine-Tuned Prompt Enhancer]], [[Prompts/Prompt Generators-Enhancers/PPM/PPM]]Ex. Of 'Reverse Engineering' 
- [x]  **[[Philosophical Analyst w/ Lists of Use Cases]],** Lex’s “100” ways to explore and develop based off REN.
    - Maybe try grouping similar/overlapping themes from the 100 'use cases' and see if this gets a decent response. 
- [ ] [[314quotes]] [[anthology]] 

<br>

- [ ] [[MEMORYGPT]] 

<br>

- [ ] [AiAgent.app](https://AiAgent.app "https://AiAgent.app") with [[🌳 ToT Prompt Structure]]structured prompts

<br>

- [ ] LEX’s [[Strangely Human Questions]]

<br>

- Get Ai to tell me something I _don't_ 'know', not what I do know. And further, to stop asking for what it is that I don't even know what I'm looking for. Chasing ghosts over here.
    - the guy who claim a sort of strange mystical experience of ‘Nothingness’.
    - [[How to use AI for Philosophy]] [[2024-1-1]]  [[now2024-1-1]]
- Criticism of Nihiltheism as a ‘contradiction’?  The ‘thing’ that you used (your consciousness) in order to make this criticism is a contradiction. [[Nihiltheism Q&A]]

### 2024-01-11

-  Nietzsche's criticisms of "pity" and slave mentality values must have been because of his attempt to build up the strong man that could live in the face of Nihilism. His philosophy, in the area of his attempt to move past nihilism, is nothing more than a _illusory pep talk._

- [x] Use "BookToPrompt" GPT, whether specifically for 'Language', another topic, or NT in general⁠.
    - Produced [[Nihilism_Language_SP]] and [Journal314 First Prompt](NT%20Research/Notes%20on%20Mystical/Mystical%20Tags/Journal314%20First%20Prompt.md "upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=3068E7F3-3166-4FB7-B545-758F8FC7CF1D")
- [ ] [[Strangely Human Questions]]
- [ ] Have them write out more on Nihiltheism in the form of summarizing, outlining, ask Ai to develop on ideas, ask Ai to expand on already given ideas, focus on 'Language' development.
- [ ] Read Jnana Yoga and take Quotes
- [ ] Combine Prompts. Ex: [[Prompts/Prompt Generators-Enhancers/Quartzite Ai/Super Philosophical Analyst]]
- [ ] Turn [[Brief Prompt Enhancer]] into concise ending for all prompts.
