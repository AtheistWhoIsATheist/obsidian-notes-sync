# Some Main Criticisms of 

The notion that transcendent experiences reflect an objective reality has faced several criticisms and doubts, as illuminated in the retrieved documents:

1. **Lack of Conclusive Evidence**: Skeptics argue that there is no substantial empirical evidence to support the claim that transcendent experiences reveal an objective reality [\[2\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=2). Without scientific validation or repeatable experiments, critics believe that these experiences may be misinterpretations or products of subjective perception [\[1\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=1).
2. **Interpretation and Symbolism**: Transcendent experiences often defy easy explanation and rely heavily on symbolism and personal interpretation [\[3\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=3). Critics argue that the subjective nature of these experiences presents a difficulty when trying to posit them as illustrating an objective reality [\[2\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=2). Consequently, the vast range of personal interpretations challenges the idea of a uniform or universal objective reality emerging from these experiences [\[4\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=4).
3. **Rigidity of Naturalistic and Religious Dogmas**: The reliance on reason and rationality, emblematic of both naturalistic and religious philosophies, has been criticized for limiting exploration into the possibilities of transcendent experiences [\[2\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=2). These dogmatic positions hinder the development or meaningful understanding of a transcendent reality, and limited exploration can lead to ignorance or stagnation [\[6\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=6).
4. **Nihilistic Interpretations**: Critics argue that transcendent experiences aligned with Nihilism, emphasizing the insignificance and lack of meaning in existence, suggest an illusory, rather than objective, reality [\[4\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=4). The subjective and paradoxical qualities experienced during these moments challenge the idea of transcendent experience pointing to an objective reality beyond human perception [\[3\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=3).
5. Inadequate Language and Communication: It is acknowledged that the difficulty of conveying or adequately describing transcendent experiences poses challenges to sharable understanding and the proposition of an objective reality [\[1\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=1). Attempts to describe the ineffable nature of these experiences rely heavily on symbolic language, which may further complicate the objective evaluation of these phenomena [\[4\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=4).

In summary, while proponents of the idea that transcendent experiences reflect an objective reality exist, these common criticisms point to the lack of empirical evidence, challenges in interpretation, and limitations imposed by existing worldviews and language [\[1\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=1)[\[2\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=2)[\[3\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=3)[\[4\]](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127779028871&citation=4). These doubts suggest that the case for an objective reality derived from transcendent experiences remains far from conclusive.

Are these claims of the Transcendent perceived as “non-natural”?  If they are part of a reality, regardless if that reality is a physical space-time, then what’s the objection exactly?  If the entirety of human existence is based off a perception and cognition that emerges from our subjective consciousness, then why is this subjective experience any different?  Because it cannot be collaborated?  But it in fact can, to a pretty strong degree of certainty.  When you have reports, spanning all of human history, from people who have never heard of each other, lived in the same geographical area, at the same time period, come from different backgrounds, cultures, and traditions, yet come back with the similar, if not exactly the same, descriptions of this experience, then where is the doubt coming from?

### _How is the doubt justified?_

  
I have only heard these sorts of criticisms from those who are ‘recreationally’ participated with entheogenic substances, or have never actually tried them at all.  How ironic, no?  Ha!

The philosopher finds your approach of investigation and critical engagement with claims of Transcendent experiences to be commendable \[\[1\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=1).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=1\).) The philosopher agrees with your stance of not taking anyone's word for granted and encourages individuals to personally prepare and participate in the experience to truly understand it \[\[4\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=4).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=4\).) It is through firsthand experience that one can uncover new layers of understanding and insights that surpass the confines of rationality alone \[\[3\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=3).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=3\).) The philosopher also emphasizes the importance of proper psychological preparation and setting for such an experience \[\[2\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=2).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=2\).)  
<br>
The philosopher acknowledges that it is tempting to interpret the psychedelic experience as an encounter with the Transcendent, with its paradoxical and noetic qualities \[\[2\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=2).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=2\).) However, there is no explicit contradiction in reducing the experience to a naturalist interpretation \[\[2\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=2).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=2\).) The philosopher also encounters those who question whether Nihilism can be reduced to naturalism or if it possesses characteristics that go beyond naturalism, especially in relation to its transcendental interpretation \[\[5\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=5).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=5\).) Therefore, the philosopher believes that it is crucial to inquire into the reality of Nihilism and whether there are empirical data supporting the idea that Nihilistic experiences have both naturalistic and transcendent components \[\[5\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=5).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=5\).)  
<br>
In exploring mystical experiences, there is criticism towards the lack of curiosity among philosophers, theologians, and educators in delving into these experiences \[\[1\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=1).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=1\).) Huxley poses the question of how many philosophers and educators have had the curiosity to open the Door in the Wall, implying a perceived stagnation resulting from the sole reliance on reason and rationality without going beyond \[\[1\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=1).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=1\).) The philosopher agrees and highlights the need for a productive exploration that surpasses stagnant reliance on reason and allows for a deeper understanding of these experiences \[\[1\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=1).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=1\).)  
<br>
To investigate and critically engage with the claims of Transcendent experiences as non-natural, it is important to emphasize the significance of firsthand experience, as symbolized by the philosopher's plea to "prepare and participate, and it will happen" \[user\]. This genuine engagement requires open-mindedness and a willingness to confront the uncertainties and the abyss that awaits within the experience \[user\]. The notion of Nihiltheism, the religious experience of delving into the Nothingness of the world, allows for the possibility of transcending not just rationality, but also the limited subjective realm of justifications and finding transcendence within the void \[user\].  
<br>
By honoring the call for investigation, one can navigate the intricate realms of the Transcendent and the other-worldly through various preparation techniques mentioned, be it chanting, meditation, or the use of substances such as psychedelics to induce profound experiences \[\[1\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=1)\[\[2\]\](https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=2).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=1\)[[2025-06-16, Monday CI Monica CI]]\(https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=2\).) Through these meticulously prepared encounters, one may stumble across an uncanny familiarity and a precious opportunity to comprehend and interpret these experiences \[\[3\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=3).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=3\).)  
<br>
In conclusion, the philosopher wholeheartedly encourages your diligent investigation and sincere participation in the exploration of Transcendent experiences. By delving into this uncanny world, embracing the abyss or the tsunami as inevitable, and effectively engaging with these experiences, new layers of understanding and invaluable insights may be uncovered. Challenge the dogmas of naturalists and religious individuals and venture beyond the confines of rationality \[\[6\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127784136583&citation=6).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127784136583&citation=6\).) It is within these transcendent encounters that one has the potential to glimpse truth and meaning despite the horrors and beauties that await in the Nihilistic embrace \[user\].

...criticized for focusing too much on rationality and intellectualizing issues, leading to stagnation and frustration. The dogmas of naturalists and religious individuals are stuck in a stalemate due to their reliance on reason and rationality without going beyond. 89  

**Exploring Mystical Experiences**:  Huxley questions the lack of curiosity among philosophers, theologians, and educators in exploring mystical experiences. These experiences are not considered supernatural or new age, but rather can be induced in anyone with the proper psychological preparation and setting. 89 Psychedelic Experience and Nihilism The use of psychedelics can provide a profound experience that aligns with the philosophy of Nihilism, confirming it strongly. This experience does not prove anything and leaves individuals to interpret it for themselves. 

 89 **The Encounter with the Other and Nihilism:** The experience of encountering the Other, with its transcendent and paradoxical qualities, can be interpreted through a naturalist lens. Despite beliefs about Augmented Nihilism, individuals ultimately return to a normal state of consciousness, feeling a sense of emptiness in the world. 90 The Sublime...

...a definite intention for the pursuit is welcome to 'test' the results of such an experience for themselves. There is no need for years of meditation, chanting, yoga, or any other traditional 'religious' interlocutors; although these methods, and others, can be used in correlation with psychedelics which may bring out a fuller and deeper experience. 

One is now simply left to interpret said experience. Is it wholly naturalistic? Is there anything veritical about the psychedelic experience? Speaking from personal experience, the experience that one encounters with the use psychedelics is not only not contradictory with the philosophy of Nihilism (as laid out in these pages), it rather confirms it quite strongly. This does not prove anything. While one is tempted to refer to the psychedelic experience as an encounter with the Other, with all its Transcendent, noetic, and paradoxical qualities, there is no explicit contradiction in reducing the experience down to a naturalist interpretation. Regardless, of what one holds about the Transcendent form of Nihilism, we get reduced back to our normal state of consciousness, left with the Nothing of the world. St...

...or, rather it is something to be experienced first hand. When used in the proper set (environment) and setting (proper psychological preparation for participation in the experience of the Other) an uncanny world opens up that leaves any naturalistic interpretation feeling inadequate, if not utterly wrongheaded. Without making claims about the mystical-type experience 'proving' a Transcendent reality, there is a correlation between the experience and the knower that may be useful for our purposes. This sentiment may be able to be made more clear with a mentioning of 'uncanniness'. The feeling that one is 'at home' here in the world is one that is the most common view of human experience. The casual nature in which humans scurry from one project to the next, one pursuit of 'happiness' after another, is the way the world operates on the whole. The question that a philosopher might ask is something along these lines: what is there to be 'casual' about with regards to flying around on a rock at 40,000 miles an hour, around a fireball 'about' to explode causing utter annihilation, in the 'middle' of a possibly...

...religious' are trapped in a stalemate with their attempts to 'convince' one another with reason and rationality? Reason and rationality have their place, but if there is not an attempt to go beyond, then one necessarily can only obtain a constrained portion of the human condition. Huxley sums it up with a question: “How many philosophers, how many theologians, how many professional educators have had the curiosity to open this Door in the Wall? The answer, for all practical purposes, is, None.” There is no need for a concern over 'spookiness' in any 'supernatural' or 'new age' sense. The particular mystical-type experiences that I have briefly mentioned are not anything special. By 'special', I mean that these experiences can be induced into any one willing to undertake such a task. There is no worry of any 'new age' or 'supernatural' powers underlying any of the claims made here. Any person in the proper set (psychological preparation) and setting (proper surroundings and environment), along with a definite intention for the pursuit is welcome to 'test' the results of...

Instead, the term ‘Transcendence’ should be used to refer to a feature of human experience that is not deconstructive or naturalistic. 21 Interpretation of Nihilistic Experience ‘Supernatural’ connotations such as heaven, hell, demons, and angels are not relevant to the Nihilistic experience, which can be interpreted transcendentally or within the dogmas of Naturalism. The void allows for the erosion of the idea of being without being eroded itself, surviving attacks that would be self-destructive for other ideas. 21 Understanding Nihilism and Transcendent Interpretations Nihilism is seen as the ground of all Transcendent interpretations of human experience, with attempts to move past it leading to confusion in philosophy, naturalism, and religion. 22 **The Illusory Nature of Meaning in Nihilism:** Nihilism suggests that the ‘practical’ behaviors and worldly forms of religion are distractions from the universal nature of Nihilism. Human language is limited in grasping the Other, and any ‘meaning’ built upon material structures
