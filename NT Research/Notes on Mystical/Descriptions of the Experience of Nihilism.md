# DESCRIPTIONS OF THE EXPERIENCE OF NIHILISM

**6/28/24**
* * *

# ME:

We may also express Nihilism in the form of a question: first, put into your mind the most meaningful ‘thing’ of your existence, whether this is family, a project, a cause, a nation, or even ‘oneself’. Now, can you imagine what you hold to be most meaningful, the thing that makes your existence come across as a real possibility, as holding the complete opposite value? Of such a nature as to be completely worthless, as utterly void of all meaning? I have yet to meet a person with even a slight indication of what this question is referring to. To answer in the affirmative is to have experienced a deconstructive-terror that runs through one’s entire being. There is a vanishing of any ground that was once placed under the feet of your existence. Trap door open. Falling commence. Why am I still falling? This can’t go on forever. Ah, and it does not. You will perish. You will leave. You are Nothing. If this does not effect your perspective, then you are the definition of worthless. The experience of you, and your lack, or incapability, of comprehending the human situation is enough to make me hang myself with a dirty sock.

# HEIDEGGER:

"In particular, that in the face of which one has anxiety is not encountered as something definite with which one can concern oneself; the threatening does not come from what is ready-to-hand or present-at-hand, but rather from the fact that neither of these ‘says’ anything any longer. Environmental entities no longer have any involvement. _**The world in which I exist has sunk into insignificance**_ (my emphasis); and the world which is thus disclosed is one in which entities can be freed only in the character of having no involvement. Anxiety is anxious in the face of the nothing of the world (my emphasis); but this does not mean that in anxiety we experience something like the absence of what is present-at-hand with-the-world. The present-at-hand must be encountered in just such a way that it does not have any involvement whatsoever, but can show itself in an empty mercilessness." Heidegger

# NIETZSCHE

One way in which Nietzsche speaks of Nihilism comes from a term he referred to as the ‘Absurd Valuation’. He puts his description in the mouth of his Zarathustra: "What is your greatest experience? It is the hour of the great contempt. The hour in which even your happiness becomes repulsive to you, and even your reason and virtue. The hour when you say: "What good is my happiness! It is poverty and dirt and wretched contentment. But my happiness should justify existence itself! The hour when you say: "What good is my reason! does it long for knowledge as the lion for his food? It is poverty and dirt and wretched contentment!" The hour when you say: "What good are my virtues?! As yet they have not made me rage with passion. How weary I am of my good and evil! It is all poverty and dirt and wretched contentment!"

# JAMES

William James puts it this way: "Conceive yourself, if possible, suddenly stripped of all the emotion with which your world now inspires you, and try to imagine it AS IT EXISTS, purely by itself, without your favorable or unfavorable, hopeful or apprehensive comment. It will be almost impossible for you to realize such a condition of negativity and deadness."

# SWAMI VIVEKANANDA

 Swami Vivekananda’s words speak to this: 

 "In one form or another, we are all in it. It is a most difficult and intricate state of things to understand. It has been preached in every country, taught everywhere, but only believed in by a few, because until we get the experiences ourselves we cannot believe in it (my emphasis). What does it show? Something very terrible. For it is all futile. Time, the avenger of everything, comes, and nothing is left. He swallows up the saint and the sinner, the king and the peasant, the beautiful and the ugly; he leaves nothing. Everything is rushing towards that one goal, destruction. Our knowledge, our arts, our sciences, everything is rushing towards it. None can stem the tide, none can hold it back for a minute. We may try to forget it, in the same way that persons in a plague-stricken city try to create oblivion by drinking, dancing, and other vain attempts, and so becoming paralyzed. So we are trying to forget, trying to create oblivion by all sorts of sense-pleasures."
