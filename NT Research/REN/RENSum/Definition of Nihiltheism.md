# Definition of Nihiltheism

8/19/24

* * *

  

Nihiltheism is a complex philosophical stance that seeks to navigate the intersection between nihilism and theism, incorporating elements of existentialism, absurdism, and mysticism. It acknowledges the apparent meaninglessness of existence while simultaneously exploring the possibility of transcendent meaning or divine absence. This paradoxical approach draws from various philosophical and religious traditions, creating a rich tapestry of thought that challenges conventional understanding of both nihilism and theism.

### \*Mystical Atheism\*

- Meister Eckhart's concept of the "Godhead beyond God" informs Nihiltheism's exploration of transcendence beyond traditional theistic conceptions.
- Simone Weil's writings on divine absence and affliction contribute to Nihiltheism's understanding of the experience of meaninglessness as potentially spiritually significant. \*Buddhist Philosophy\*
- **Nagarjuna's** concept of sunyata (emptiness) aligns with Nihiltheism's recognition of the lack of inherent meaning or essence in phenomena.
- Zen koan practice, which often involves paradoxical statements, informs Nihiltheism's comfort with logical contradictions in pursuit of deeper truth. 

### \*Existential Theism\*

- Søren Kierkegaard's "leap of faith" and concept of subjective truth inform Nihiltheism's approach to personal meaning-making in the face of objective meaninglessness.
- Paul Tillich's idea of "God above God" contributes to Nihiltheism's exploration of divinity beyond traditional theistic conceptions. 

### \*Phenomenology\*

- Martin Heidegger's concepts of "Being-towards-death" and "thrownness" inform Nihiltheism's approach to authenticity and the human condition.
- Emmanuel Levinas' ethics of the Other contributes to Nihiltheism's exploration of meaning through interpersonal relationships and responsibility. 

### \*Postmodern Thought\*

- **Jacques Derrida's** deconstruction informs Nihiltheism’s critique of fixed meanings and binary oppositions.
- **Jean-François Lyotard’s** incredulity towards metanarratives aligns with Nihiltheism’s skepticism of overarching explanatory frameworks. \*Process Philosophy\*
- **Alfred North Whitehead's** concept of God as both primordial and consequent nature informs Nihiltheism’s dynamic view of divinity and meaning.
- **Charles Hartshorne's** panentheism contributes to Nihiltheism’s exploration of divine immanence within a seemingly meaningless universe. \*Transpersonal Psychology\*
- **Ken Wilber's** integral theory informs Nihiltheism’s attempt to synthesize diverse perspectives on meaning and transcendence.
- **Stanislav Grof's** research on non-ordinary states of consciousness contributes to Nihiltheism’s exploration of transcendent experiences within a materialist framework. \*Quantum Mysticism\*
- **David Bohm's** implicate order theory informs Nihiltheism’s consideration of hidden dimensions of reality beyond apparent meaninglessness.
- **Fritjof Capra's** "Tao of Physics" contributes to Nihiltheism’s exploration of parallels between modern physics and mystical traditions. \*Secular Spirituality\*
- **Sam Harris's** writings on spirituality without religion inform Nihiltheism’s approach to transcendent experiences within a naturalistic worldview.
- **André Comte-Sponville’s** concept of "atheist spirituality" contributes to Nihiltheism’s exploration of meaning and wonder without traditional theistic beliefs.

  

## Synthesizing these diverse influences, Nihiltheism emerges as a philosophical approach that:

- Acknowledges the lack of inherent meaning in the universe while remaining open to the possibility of created or discovered meaning.
- Explores the tension between the experience of meaninglessness and the human drive for significance.
- Investigates the nature of transcendence and divinity beyond traditional theistic conceptions.
- Embraces paradox and contradiction as potentially revelatory of deeper truths.
- Emphasizes direct, lived experience over abstract reasoning in the pursuit of understanding.
- Seeks authenticity through confronting the reality of death and the apparent absurdity of existence.
- Remains open to mystical or non-ordinary experiences while maintaining a critical, questioning stance.
- Recognizes the interconnectedness of all phenomena while acknowledging the potential ultimate groundlessness of reality.
- Explores ethical frameworks based on interpersonal responsibility rather than divine command or objective moral facts.
- Aims to cultivate a sense of wonder and engagement with life, even in the face of apparent cosmic indifference.

Nihiltheism is an unorthodox philosophical stance that merges the existential desolation of Nihilism with the profound recognition of a higher, transcendent reality. It acknowledges the stark absurdity of existence, the dissolution of conventional values, and the ultimate insignificance of all entities, while simultaneously positing that these very realizations are reverberations of a divine, ineffable truth. This philosophy suggests that the experience of Nothingness is not merely a void but a gateway to understanding the transcendent, revealing a higher state of being where the dissolution of the ego-self leads to mystical unity with the divine.

# Non-Movement, Value, & Nihiltheism

The idea of the Transcendent being revealed through Nihilism, combined with the claim of Non-Movement is not contradictory at all, only within an out dated western view is there an issue. If we are all one, the self or ego is an illusion, then there is no saving, there is no helping, there is no hurting, there's only non-movement. This idea is not only not contradictory, it's rather robustly coherent, as the "ambiguity" which is a stupid word, of values, makes more sense under this view. The idea of guilt, like Heidegger an Kierkegaard state, isn't about the other, it's about not paying attention to the self or true self1. And since we're all one and the and the same thing, then no wonder we turn to the true Self, or attempt to discover if there is a true self, because there is no way you can change the ego attached to another physical body, as you can't stop your own ego inside your flesh body. would also not only
