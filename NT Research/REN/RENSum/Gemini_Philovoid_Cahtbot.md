# The Religious Experience of Nihilism

This work presents an interpretation of Nihilism not as a mere intellectual stance of meaninglessness but as a profound, often terrifying, and ultimately religious experience. It is a work of questions rather than answers, aiming to move beyond the misguided "everyday" definitions of nihilism to explore it as a potential, albeit perilous, path to Transcendental Reality. This exploration is paradoxical, fighting a battle between "smug confidence and complete humility," as it seeks to articulate an experience that is fundamentally ineffable. The ideas expressed are not original but are a coalescence of insights from a diverse array of thinkers—saints, philosophers, mystics, and suicides—whose words converge on a singular, universal experience. As Emil Cioran states, "existence is plagiarism," and in this spirit, this synthesis does not claim authorship but acts as a messenger for a unified voice that speaks across time and culture, asserting that "There are no heroes here."

### **Part I: The Abyssal Experience and the Collapse of Meaning**

The philosophical landscape of Nihilism is bifurcated. There is the common, worldly nihilism that proceeds from the Abyss, where **"God is nothing and the world is all,"** a faith placed in transient things that end in nothing. In stark contrast stands a religious "Nihilism" that proceeds from abundance, where **"to him, in the end, the world is nothing, and God is all"** (Fr. Seraphim Rose). This latter form, a profound spiritual disorder requiring spiritual means to overcome, is the focus of this inquiry.

#### The Nature of the Experience

This religious Nihilism is not an intellectual concept to be debated but a direct, abyssal experience—a "sudden revelation of life's meaninglessness" that shatters the foundation of existence. It is not a mental illness but a spiritual crisis, as described by Herman Tønnessen in his graphic depiction of a man who, in a moment of "inverted serendipity," suddenly sees himself as "an upholstered pile of bones and knuckles" and his life as a "ludicrously brief interlude between embryo and corpse." This confrontation permeates him with "dread and anguish, with ‘ontological despair’ and ‘existential frustration.’"

This experience is consistently characterized by several core elements:

- **Anxiety and Dread**: Soren Kierkegaard defines anxiety as **"freedom's possibility,"** an absolutely formative force that **"consumes all finite ends, discovers all their deceptions."** Martin Heidegger describes it as a state where the world "has sunk into insignificance" and one is anxious in the face of the "nothing of the world." This is not fear of a specific object but a "feeling of cosmic panic" (Peter Zapffe) that reveals the "uncanny" nature of existence.
- **The Revelation of Nothingness**: This is not a mere absence but a potent, palpable void. It is, in the words of Fr. Seraphim Rose, "the nothingness out of which God has called each man into being, and back to which man seems to fall when he denies God." It is a state of "negativity and deadness" (William James) where all finite things are "annihilated in the presence of the infinite" (Blaise Pascal).
- **The Absurd Perspective**: Friedrich Nietzsche termed this the **"hour of the great contempt,"** where even one's happiness, reason, and virtue become repulsive. It is the realization that one is forced to make value judgments in a valueless universe, rendering every action, concern, or judgment baseless and absurd. All possibilities become equivalent, and all endeavors futile.

#### The Primacy of Direct Experience

Intellectual notions of Nihilism are dismissed as "stillborn." The experience must be lived. As Swami Vivekananda states, it "has been preached in every country, taught everywhere, but only believed in by a few, because until we get the experiences ourselves we cannot believe in it." This direct experience can be triggered by various confrontations with finitude and meaninglessness:

- **The Terror of Mortality**: Pascal highlights the inescapable reality that "death, which threatens us every moment, must infallibly place us within a few years under the dreadful necessity of being for ever either annihilated or unhappy." This recognition of our "malignantly useless being" (Thomas Ligotti) makes consciousness the "parent of all horrors."
- **The Abyss of "Deep Time"**: The human mind is not built to handle the vastness of time, which reveals the utter erasure of past lives and civilizations. Will Durant speaks of a "thousand varieties of man...[who] left no more to posterity than a few flints and scratches." This perspective exposes the transitoriness of all human works and the eventual heat-death of the universe itself, which Ligotti terms "nothing in motion."
- **Boredom and Vanity**: Arthur Schopenhauer identifies boredom as "direct proof that existence has no real value in itself; for what is boredom but the feeling of the emptiness of life?" This is echoed by countless spiritual figures, from Buddha's lament—**"Oh worldly men! how fatally deluded!"**—to the declarations of Ecclesiastes and St. John of the Cross that all created things are, in comparison to God, "perfect darkness" and "nothing."

### **Part II: The Uncanny Illusion of the World and the Inauthentic Life**

From the nihilistic experience emerges a radical revaluation of the world. It is seen as a "low, dark, filthy cell" (Vivekananda), a "sad farce" (St. Theresa of Avila), and a "horrible nightmare" whose pleasures are "only vanity" (Pascal). The truly wise, as Thomas à Kempis asserts, are those who count "all earthly things as dung."

#### The "Unthinking" and the Mechanisms of Evasion

The vast majority of humanity, however, avoids this realization through a complex system of evasion and self-deception. Ernest Becker terms this "lie therapy, whether religious or secular," which is "overwhelmingly the normative state of the human race." People are protected from reality by several mechanisms:

- **Distraction and Diversion**: Pascal observed that all human unhappiness comes from the inability "to stay quietly in their own chamber." Men seek the "bustle which averts these thoughts of ours, and amuses us," from gambling and hunting to war and high office, to avoid reflecting on their "nothingness, his forlornness, his insufficiency."
- **Cultural Routines**: Becker notes that "cultural routine" and "the craziness of these activities is exactly that of the human condition. They are 'right' for us because the alternative is natural desperation. The daily madness of these jobs is a repeated vaccination: against the madness of the asylum."
- **Idolatry of the Finite**: People retreat into a "superficial-selfish interpretation of the religious languages," family relations, and worldly pleasures. This includes the idolatry of scientism, where a formal description of "how" is mistaken for an answer to "why," and academic philosophy, which becomes a "fancy Sudoku puzzle" that masks inner torments.

#### The Divided Self and the Fall into the World

The fundamental human condition is one of internal schism. This has been described as the "divided self" (William James), "double-mindedness" (Kierkegaard), and the internal struggle between two wills, "one carnal, the other spiritual" (St. Augustine). Man is simultaneously "worm and god" (Becker), a paradox that explains why even the most profound insights are fleeting and why ideals are rarely lived. Martin Heidegger describes this as an ontological state of "always falling back into the 'they'," a plunging into the "groundlessness and nullity of inauthentic everydayness." This falling nature is the source of existential "guilt"—not a moral failing, but the state of not living up to one's authentic "True-Self."

### **Part III: The Perilous Crossroads: Madness, Suicide, or Faith**

The terrifying insight of nihilism places the individual at a crossroads with three potential outcomes:

#### 1. Madness

Multiple thinkers suggest that a full, unmitigated apprehension of the human condition would lead to insanity. Becker states, **"I believe that those who speculate that a full apprehension of man’s condition would drive him insane are right, quite literally right."** Pascal concurs: "Men are so necessarily mad, that not to be mad would amount to another form of madness." The philosopher, in daring to look at the terror of creation, is often perceived by the world as mad, "unaware that he is possessed by god" (Plato).

#### 2. Rational Suicide

If reason is pursued to its most ruthless conclusion without a leap into faith, suicide can appear as the only logical response. This is exemplified by the "experiment in nihilism" of **Mitchell Heisman**, who sought to live out the implications of a purely naturalistic worldview. His methodology was **"honesty to the point of absurdity; honesty without mercy...to will death through truth and truth through death."** His suicide suggests that a life of "active unbelief" may culminate in "rational self-destruction." A distinction is made between this "Nihilistic suicide"—a potential release into the Divine after the world has already died—and a "worldly suicide," which is a flight from the loss of a finite idol, a despair over something earthly. Peter Zapffe goes so far as to call the modern "saving" of the suicidal a "hair-raising misapprehension of the nature of existence."

#### 3. The Leap of Faith

The horrors of nihilism, according to Evelyn Underhill, can "only be escaped by the exercise of faith." This, however, is not a simple intellectual assent but a radical, paradoxical commitment.

- **It is the Courage of Despair**: Paul Tillich argues that one cannot liberate oneself from the grip of meaninglessness. The only valid answer is one that accepts this state as its precondition: **"namely that the acceptance of despair is in itself faith. In this situation the meaning of life is reduced to despair about the meaning of life."**
- **It is Beyond Morality**: For Kierkegaard, "the opposite of sin is not virtue but faith." Faith is a leap beyond the ethical, beyond human conceptions of good and evil, into a direct, absolute relationship with the Absolute.
- **It is Trust in the Irrational**: It is a trust in "man's innate but strictly irrational instinct for that Real 'above all reason, beyond all thought'" (Underhill).

### **Part IV: The Mystical Path: Purgation and Transcendence**

For those who take the path of faith, the response to the crisis of nihilism is a rigorous spiritual discipline involving **renunciation** of the world and the **annihilation** of the self. This is the Purgative Way, a painful but necessary stripping away of all that is not God.

#### The Dark Night of the Soul

This process is often described as a "Dark Night of the Soul" (St. John of the Cross), a spiritual martyrdom of "horrible desolations and inward torments" (St. Molinos). It involves a contempt for all created things, recognizing them as "nothing," and a willing acceptance of suffering, dryness, and trouble as the "real spiritual cross." The goal is the death of the self, the ego, the "I, Me, Mine," which is the "opaque veil that hides the Face of God" (A.W. Tozer).

#### Nothingness as the Gateway to God

The central paradox of this path is that the ultimate reality, God, is found in and through the very Nothingness that initiated the crisis.

- Emile Cioran states: **"The initial revelation of any monastery: everything is nothing. Thus begin all mysticisms. It is less than one step from nothing to God, for God is the positive expression of nothingness."** He further declares, "Without God, everything is nothingness. But God is the supreme nothingness!"
- Meister Eckhart concurs: "Only he knows God who recognizes that all creatures are nothingness."
- Thomas Merton describes the sacred attitude as one that "penetrates into that darkness and that nothingness, realizing that the mercy of God has transformed our nothingness into His temple."

#### Direct Encounters with the Other

While traditional asceticism is one path, the texts also point to more direct, empirical methods of encountering this Transcendent reality, opening a "Door in the Wall" that academic philosophy and theology largely ignore.

- **The Psychedelic Experience**: The use of psychedelics, specifically **psilocybin**, is presented as a way to induce a mystical experience that can "irreconcilably disrupt" one's worldview. Aldous Huxley describes this as encountering the _Mysterium tremendum_, a "pressure of reality greater than a mind...could possibly bear," which is at once of "intenser beauty, deeper significance" and terrifying to the point of panic. Houston Smith describes his experience as being ushered into a world that was "strange, weird, uncanny, significant, and terrifying beyond belief."
- **Music**: The music of **Johann Sebastian Bach**, particularly his organ works, is identified as another powerful medium for this encounter. Cioran claims, "Listening to Bach, one sees God come into being. His music generates divinity." Heisman found in Bach an external "holistic-mind order" to counter his own "material self-consistency."

However, a crucial caveat is introduced by Paul Tillich: **"The experience of meaninglessness is more radical than mysticism. Therefore it transcends the mystical experience."** The mystical state, while a blow to naturalism, is often fleeting. The individual is inevitably dropped back into the world, where irresolvable doubt and the "sublime melancholy of our lot" (Martin Buber) reassert themselves. The unbridgeable gap between the finite and the Infinite remains.

### **Part V: Towards a Language of Nihilism**

The ineffable nature of the nihilistic and mystical experience poses a profound challenge to language. The experience is fundamentally **"non-transferable."** As St. Therese of Lisieux writes of her spiritual darkness, "I wish I could express what I feel, but it is beyond me. One must have passed through this dark tunnel to understand its blackness." Clichés and "idle talk" are dismissed as useless evasions.

This necessitates the development of a **"new language of Nihilism"**—a symbolic, self-critical language that can navigate the experience without resorting to dead myths or sterile naturalism. The proposed term for this endeavor is **"Nihiltheism."** The groundwork for this language is found in the philosophy of **Martin Heidegger**, whose analysis in _Being and Time_ provides an introductory "map."

Heidegger's concepts allow for a non-naturalistic interpretation of the human condition:

- **Being-Towards-Death**: This concept encapsulates the authentic response to finitude. It consists of **anxiety** in a **moment of vision**, a **call of conscience** that seems to come "from me and beyond me" and causes the world to "drop out" into insignificance. This allows one to escape "everydayness" and turn inward to discover one's **True-Self**.

This "atheistic" language is shown to parallel the "theistic" language of mystics. Heidegger's analysis of the world sinking into insignificance is functionally identical to Thomas Merton's call to penetrate our "inner emptiness" where God has hidden His light. A nihilistic language would aim to reconcile such superficial disparities, recognizing that both describe the same core experience. Heidegger himself admitted this structure was "fantastical" and resisted both biological and traditional theological explanations, seeking to keep the mystery of the "Why?" open. Such a language would not rescue one from Nothingness but bring one "face to face" with the nightmare of existence, wherein its "positive" content is revealed.

In sum, the collected texts articulate a radical reinterpretation of nihilism as the central spiritual crisis of the human condition. It is a terrifying and destructive force that shatters the inauthentic self and all finite attachments. Yet, it is precisely within this abyss of meaninglessness—this confrontation with Nothingness—that a path to Transcendence is forged. This journey, whether undertaken through ascetic discipline, psychedelic exploration, or profound philosophical despair, requires the annihilation of the self and a courageous faith that embraces ultimate uncertainty. The final, paradoxical truth toward which this experience points is one where the greatest polarities collapse: **Nihilism is God. God is Nothing.**
