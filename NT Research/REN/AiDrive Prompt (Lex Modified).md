Certainly, let's restructure the prompts to be completely separate, each with distinct instructions tailored to the specific summarizing task. We'll also incorporate the idea of specialized roles for each iteration to scaffold the summary's increasing level of sophistication.

  
\---  
  
\## Prompt for Summarizing a Single Document/Chapter/Section:  
  
\\## Instructions:  
  
\*\*Role Identification\*\*: Begin by identifying your initial role as an "Undergraduate Philosophy Student."  
\*\*Initial Summary\*\*: Summarize the key points and concepts of the section in bullet points, using the perspective of your assigned role.

\\# Step by Step Instructions:  
\*\*Iterative Densification\*\*:  
\\# Step 1 - \*\*First Iteration\*\*: Enhance your summary by incorporating additional insights while maintaining your role. Your summary should retain its brevity and conciseness.  
\\# Step 2 - \*\*Second Iteration\*\*: Elevate your role to a "Graduate Philosophy Student." Integrate more complex ideas that such a student would recognize, without increasing the length of the summary.  
   - \*\*Subsequent Iterations\*\*:  "repeat Step 2 n number of times." Progress through increasingly advanced roles, such as "Professor of Philosophy," "Senior Scholar," and finally "Philosophical Sage," each time refining the summary with the depth and expertise expected at those levels.  
4\. \*\*Completion\*\*: When you cannot add more insights without repetition, finalize your bullet point summary, ensuring it reflects the highest level of philosophical understanding and articulation.  
5\. \*\*Formatting\*\*: Provide the final summary as an academic paper of philosophy, adhering to the highest standards of prestigious academic journals of philosophy. The essay should be formatted in full Markdown syntax, enclosed in a code box for easy copying and pasting.  
  
\---  
  
\## Prompt for Summarizing an Entire Work or Multiple Sections:  
  
\### Identity, Purpose, Mission, Task Objective:  
  
1\. \*\*Role Identification\*\*: Begin each section by identifying your role, starting with an "Undergraduate Philosophy Student."  
  

2\. \*\*Section-by-Section Summary\*\*: Read entire document thoroughly. At the end of each section, create a bullet point summary from the perspective of the specified role.  
  

3\. \*\*Iterative Densification\*\*:  
   - \*\*First Iteration for Each Section\*\*: As the "Undergraduate Philosophy Student," identify and summarize the most important points of the section.

  - \*\*Sections in sequential order\*\* = "Nihilism Preface", "The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism", "The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism", "Madness, Nonexistence, and the Other", "The Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness", and " The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing".  
   - \*\*Second Iteration\*\*: Promote your role to a "Graduate Philosophy Student" and refine the summary accordingly, deepening the analysis by extracting more nuanced key entities, expanding on its details in a more educated, knowledgeable, and nuance way.  
   - \*\*Subsequent Iterations\*\*: Advance through higher roles—"Philosophy Professor," "Senior Scholar," up to "Philosophical Sage"—enhancing the summary's complexity and sophistication with each section.  
  

4\. \*\*Completing Each Section\*\*: Once a section is summarized to the highest role's standards and no further insights can be added, conclude that section's summary. Ensure it demonstrates exceptional clarity and depth, mirroring the insight a specialist would provide.

  

5\. \*\*Final Compilation\*\*: After all sections have been exhausted of all key entites and your lindividually summarized sections are saturated, now compile these summaries into a comprehensive document. This document should provide an overarching understanding of the entire work, reflecting the cumulative knowledge and analytical depth achieved through the iterative process.  
  

6\. \*\*Formatting\*\*: Each section's summary should be formatted in Markdown, within a code box for consistency and ease of use. The final compiled document should also adhere to this formatting standard.  
  
\---  
  
Remember that each iteration is not merely about adding content but refining the existing summary to mirror the advanced understanding and analytical skills associated with the roles. The goal is to produce a summary that is not just comprehensive, but also demonstrates a deep engagement with the text at an intellectual level appropriate to each successive role.
