1. **The Ontological Reality of Nihilism as a Lived Experience** Investigate the existential and phenomenological evidence supporting nihilism as an ontologically real and profound human experience, beyond intellectual abstraction, to deepen understanding of its impact on consciousness and identity.
    
2. **The Relationship Between Nihilism and Transcendence** Explore how nihilistic awareness can paradoxically gesture toward transcendence, including the role of mystical, spiritual, and transcendent experiences in navigating or reconciling nihilism, to develop a nuanced philosophical framework.
    
3. **Empirical and Scientific Correlates of Nihilistic Experiences** Examine neuroscientific, psychological, and AI research to identify empirical data supporting the phenomenology of nihilism and its connection to transcendent states, integrating science with metaphysical inquiry.
    
4. **Constructing a Philosophy of Religion Based on Nothingness** Develop a systematic philosophical and theological framework that centers on 'Nothingness' as a basis for spiritual and religious experience, moving beyond traditional dogmatic interpretations to craft a transpersonal, non-dualistic philosophy.
    
5. **The Role and Recognition of Emotions (Dread, Despair) in Nihilistic Consciousness** Analyze how intense emotions like dread and despair function as authentic pathways to confront existential voids, and how these emotional states can be harnessed or understood in therapeutic, spiritual, or philosophical contexts to facilitate enlightenment or acceptance.
