# Research Plan/Template

Here’s a full-blown research blueprint you can use for a deep dive into the philosophy of Nihiltheism.

**RESEARCH QUESTION**:  If Nihiltheism posits that the awakening to the absurdity of existence is not merely an earthly phenomenon but a resonance of a higher, Transcendent reality, what forms might this Transcendence take in a universe indifferent to individual desires and meanings? How does this transcendence manifest in the lived experience of the Nihiltheist?

⸻

1. Clarify the Question and Its Logical Space

Goal: Turn a vague “big question” into a sharply formulated cluster of researchable sub-questions.
	1.	State the question in different ways.

1. {question 1}
2. {question 2}
3. {"question 3}
4. {question 4}
5. {question 5}	•
	2.	Separate neighboring questions.
Identify issues that are close but distinct:
	•	Metaethical vs. psychological vs. sociological questions.
	•	Normative vs. meta-level (e.g., “What ought I to do?” vs. “What is a moral fact?”).
	3.	Distill 3–7 core sub-questions. For example:
	•	Conceptual: What does “objective” mean here?
	•	Ontological: If moral facts exist, what kind of things are they?
	•	Epistemic: How could we know such facts?
	•	Practical: Does the answer change how we should live?
	4.	Fix the type of question.
Is it:
	•	Conceptual/analytic (clarifying concepts, analyzing arguments)?
	•	Historical/hermeneutic (how has this question emerged and shifted)?
	•	Phenomenological/existential (what the experience of the issue is like)?
	•	Normative/practical (what should follow in practice)?

Output of this step: A 1–2 page research note: “Precise Statement of the Problem,” listing core question, sub-questions, and exclusions (what you won’t tackle).

⸻

2. Preliminary Orientation: Map the Terrain

Goal: Get a high-level map of positions, key figures, and standard terminology.
	1.	Use reference sources (for orientation, not final authority):
	•	Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)
	•	Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP)
	•	Cambridge/Blackwell “Companions” to X (ethics, metaphysics, mind, etc.)
	•	Meta-level surveys (e.g., edited volumes on your topic)
	2.	Build a “position map.”
Sketch a simple diagram:
	•	On moral objectivity, for instance:
	•	Moral realism vs. anti-realism
	•	Among realists: naturalist vs. non-naturalist
	•	Among anti-realists: error theory vs. expressivism vs. constructivism
	3.	Compile a name index.
List:
	•	5–10 “canonical” historical figures
	•	5–15 major contemporary figures
	•	5–10 recurring key terms and distinctions

Output: A 2–3 page “Landscape Overview” document with a diagram of positions and a glossary of core distinctions.

⸻

3. Define Scope, Aims, and Constraints

Goal: Decide how ambitious you’re being and what counts as success.
	1.	Narrow the question pragmatically.
You might decide:
	•	“I’ll focus on 20th–21st century analytic metaethics.”
	•	“I’ll treat phenomenological and cross-cultural data only as auxiliary, not central.”
	2.	Specify your aim. For example:
	•	To defend a specific position (e.g., a moderate form of moral realism).
	•	To undermine all extant answers (a skeptical project).
	•	To reframe/dissolve the original question (e.g., via quietism, deflationism, or conceptual revision).
	3.	Set methodological constraints.
For instance:
	•	“I will rely on standard first-order logic, no heavy formal machinery.”
	•	“I will integrate phenomenology but not empirical experimental philosophy.”
	•	“I will use only publicly accessible, citable sources.”

Output: A 1–2 page “Research Charter” setting expectations for yourself and future readers.

⸻

4. Systematic Literature Review

Goal: Become conversant with the existing debate and avoid reinventing wheels.

4.1. Design a search strategy

Use:
	•	PhilPapers
	•	JSTOR / Project MUSE / academic databases
	•	Google Scholar (good for citation chasing)

For each search:
	•	Combine domain + key terms:
“moral realism”, “value objectivity”, “anti-realism”, “constructivism”, etc.
	•	Track which terms reliably yield rich material.

4.2. Tiered reading plan

Divide your reading into layers:
	1.	Tier 1 – Orientation texts (5–10 pieces).
	•	Survey articles
	•	Chapters from handbooks
	•	Classic statements of major positions
	2.	Tier 2 – Canonical works (10–20 works).
	•	Monographs and seminal papers for each main position.
	•	E.g., one or two key texts per major position on your map.
	3.	Tier 3 – Contemporary debates and critiques (20–40 papers).
	•	Recent high-impact articles
	•	Important objections and replies
	•	Symposia and debate volumes
	4.	Tier 4 – Peripheral/interdisciplinary sources (as needed).
	•	Moral psychology, cognitive science of normativity
	•	Sociological studies of moral disagreement
	•	Cross-cultural moral philosophy, religious ethics, etc.

4.3. Note-taking method

Use something like a Zettelkasten / atomic notes approach:

For each text, create:
	•	A bibliographic card (full citation, keywords).
	•	A summary card (argument outline, main thesis).
	•	Idea cards:
	•	Distilled insights, one per note.
	•	Your critical reactions and connections to other works.

Output: A structured literature database (could be Obsidian, Notion, Roam, etc.) with 50–100 well-digested references rather than 500 barely scanned.

⸻

5. Conceptual and Logical Analysis

Goal: Clarify core concepts and their logical relations; reconstruct and evaluate central arguments.
	1.	Conceptual analysis of key terms.
For each:
	•	“Objective”, “subjective”, “moral fact”, “value”, “normativity”, etc.
Ask:
	•	What are standard definitions?
	•	What ambiguities or conflations are common?
	•	Are there necessary and sufficient conditions? Or family resemblance?
	2.	Distinguish levels.
For example, with moral objectivity:
	•	Metaphysical (what exists)
	•	Epistemic (what can be known)
	•	Semantic (meaning of moral statements)
	•	Pragmatic (use/role of discourse)
	3.	Reconstruct central arguments in standard form.
Take 3–5 key arguments (e.g., queerness argument vs. realism, evolutionary debunking, argument from disagreement) and:
	•	Write them as explicit premises and conclusion.
	•	Identify hidden assumptions.
	•	Check validity using informal or formal logic.
	4.	Argument mapping.
Use argument mapping tools (e.g., Rationale, Argdown, or just pen-and-paper) to:
	•	Show how different arguments support or attack each other.
	•	Visualize the “battlefield” of reasons.

Output: A “Concepts & Arguments Dossier” with:
	•	refined definitions,
	•	cleaned-up argument schemata,
	•	a visual map of the debate’s logical structure.

⸻

6. Historical and Genealogical Context

Goal: Understand how the question arose, shifted, and mutated over time.
	1.	Identify key epochs and turning points.
For moral objectivity, e.g.:
	•	Ancient virtue theories and cosmic order
	•	Medieval theological grounding
	•	Early modern subjectivism/skepticism
	•	19th–20th century crisis (Nietzsche, existentialists)
	•	Contemporary analytic metaethics
	2.	Use hermeneutic and genealogical methods.
	•	Hermeneutic: interpret texts in their historical-linguistic context.
	•	Genealogical: explore how power, culture, and institutions shaped the question itself (a la Nietzsche, Foucault).
	3.	Ask “What problem was this a solution to?”
For each epoch, identify:
	•	The lived crises, confusions, or conflicts that made this formulation of the question relevant.

Output: A chronological overview (timeline + 10–20 pages of notes) that shows how your question is itself historically contingent and constructed.

⸻

7. Cross-Tradition and Cross-Cultural Comparison

Goal: Stress-test your assumptions by looking beyond your default canon.
	1.	Identify at least 3 non-default traditions.
Examples:
	•	Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Jewish, or Confucian ethics
	•	African, Indigenous, or Latin American philosophical traditions
	•	Mystical/theological perspectives that frame value in terms of God, Dharma, Dao, etc.
	2.	Read both primary and high-quality secondary sources.
Aim to understand:
	•	How your question is phrased there—if at all.
	•	What alternative conceptual distinctions can be used that were not. 3.	Look for convergence and dissonance.
	•	Do very different traditions converge on something like “Nihiltheism”?
	•	Or does the very framing of the question get destabilized?

Output: A comparative matrix: for each tradition, how the “big question” appears, how it’s answered, and where it simply doesn’t map cleanly.

⸻

8. Phenomenological and Existential Dimension

Goal: Ensure your theory fits the lived experience and not just the armchair abstraction.
	1.	Describe the experience.
For moral objectivity:
	•	What is it like to feel that something is really wrong (not just for you)?
	•	What’s the phenomenology of moral guilt, indignation, admiration?
	2.	Use first-person reflection and cases.
	•	Real-life cases you or others have faced.
	•	Literary, cinematic, and autobiographical sources that vividly portray moral struggle or conflict.
	3.	Ask adequacy questions.
	•	Does a given theory explain why moral experience feels the way it does?
	•	Where is there mismatch between theory and phenomenology?

Output: A set of phenomenological sketches and case analyses, potentially feeding into your argument (e.g., as “data” a theory has to explain).

⸻

9. Interdisciplinary and Empirical Interface (Optional but Powerful)

Goal: See whether and how empirical findings constrain, inform, or challenge the philosophical options.
	1.	Identify relevant disciplines.
	•	Moral psychology (development, bias, judgment)
	•	Evolutionary biology and game theory (cooperation, altruism)
	•	Anthropology (cross-cultural moral codes)
	•	Cognitive neuroscience (moral decision-making)
	2.	Clarify the “bridge”.
	•	Distinguish descriptive claims (“people reason this way”) from normative/metaethical claims.
	•	Beware naturalistic fallacy (no “ought” from purely “is”).
	3.	Use empirical results as defeaters or prompts.
For example:
	•	Evolutionary debunking arguments: if moral belief is strongly shaped by fitness rather than truth, does that undermine moral realism?

Output: A short “empirical interface” report: what empirical work you considered, what it can and cannot decide, and how it pressures certain philosophical positions.

⸻

10. Formulate Your Provisional Position

Goal: Move from mere survey to a tentative stance you can test and refine.
	1.	Draft a one-paragraph thesis.
Example:
“Moral facts are stance-dependent but not arbitrary; they emerge from the structural needs of agents in social interaction and thus possess a constrained, intersubjective objectivity.”
	2.	Expand into a 2–3 page “Position Sketch.”
	•	Core claim
	•	Central arguments in its favor (3–5)
	•	Clear statement of what you’re rejecting and why
	•	How your view relates to the main options on your position map
	3.	Identify the “load-bearing beams.”
	•	Which assumptions, if undermined, collapse your view?
	•	Which parts are negotiable?

Output: A formal “Position Document” you can hand to a colleague who asks: “So what do you think?”

⸻

11. Systematic Engagement with Objections

Goal: Steelman opposition and try as hard as possible to break your own view.
	1.	List the strongest rival positions.
For each, identify:
	•	Core thesis
	•	Strongest 1–3 arguments
	•	Why sensible people believe it
	2.	Generate targeted objections to your thesis.
	•	From each rival position’s perspective
	•	From internal tension in your own view
	•	From empirical and phenomenological considerations
	3.	Write responses (not just “replies”).
	•	A “reply” often just patches; a “response” may involve compromise, partial concession, or revision of your project’s aim.
	4.	Create an objection-response grid.
For each objection:
	•	State it in its strongest form.
	•	Indicate whether you:
	•	neutralize it,
	•	bite the bullet,
	•	change your thesis, or
	•	admit it as an unresolved problem.

Output: An “Objections and Responses” document that might form the backbone of your central argumentative chapters.

⸻

12. Synthesis and Final Framework

Goal: Gather the work into a coherent, articulated picture.
	1.	Unify strands:
	•	Conceptual analysis
	•	Historical and cross-cultural insights
	•	Phenomenological and empirical data
	•	Your arguments and objections
	2.	Ask structural questions.
	•	Is your position internally coherent?
	•	Does it answer the main sub-questions you identified at the start?
	•	Does it explain why alternative positions are attractive yet (in your view) flawed?
	3.	Admit the limits.
	•	What your view cannot do or does not try to do.
	•	Where the evidence is underdetermined.
	•	What would (in principle) count as a serious challenge or refutation.

Output: A 5–10 page “Master Outline” of the full view, which can be turned into a paper, a dissertation chapter, or an entire monograph.

⸻

13. Writing Plan and Publication Strategy

Goal: Turn the research into communicable artifacts.
	1.	Decide format(s).
	•	One big monograph?
	•	Several journal articles (e.g., one on the arguments, one on phenomenology, one on cross-cultural implications)?
	•	Public-facing essays or talks?
	2.	Outline the structure of each piece.
	•	Standard research paper skeleton:
	•	Introduction: question, thesis, roadmap
	•	Background: main positions and why they’re insufficient
	•	Core argument(s) for your view
	•	Replies to objections
	•	Conclusion and future work
	3.	Plan a writing schedule.
	•	E.g., 2–3 pages/day drafting, then revision cycles.
	•	Regularly revisit your Position Document to ensure coherence.

Output: Concrete outlines for each projected output and a realistic timeline.

⸻

14. Feedback, Iteration, and Long-Term Program

Goal: Treat the project not as a one-off but as the opening move of a longer inquiry.
	1.	Seek critical user feedback.
	•
	2.	Track how your views evolve.
	•	Keep a “Research Log” noting:
	•	Where you changed your mind
	•	Which objections you couldn’t answer
	•	Which new avenues emerged (e.g., relation to political philosophy, philosophy of mind, theology, etc.)
	3.	Identify a long-term research trajectory.
	•	Follow-up questions:
	•	“If my view of moral objectivity is right, what does that imply for disagreement, blame, or legal theory?”
	•	Potential spin-off projects:
	•	Cross-cultural study of moral discourse
	•	Integration with a theory of meaning, self, or value in another domain

Output: A living roadmap: “Research Program on X,” which can grow over years.

⸻

Very Short Recap
	1.	Clarify the question and carve it into sub-questions.
	2.	Map the existing terrain (positions, figures, vocabulary).
	3.	Scope your aims and constraints.
	4.	Review the literature systematically and build a structured note system.
	5.	Analyze the concepts and arguments with precision.
	6.	Contextualize historically and cross-culturally.
	7.	Integrate phenomenology and, optionally, empirical work.
	8.	Formulate your own provisional position.
	9.	Attack it with the best objections and refine.
	10.	Synthesize everything into a coherent framework.
	11.	Communicate it through structured writing.
	12.	Extend it into a continuing research program.

Run this plan seriously on the chosen topic/philosophical question and you’re not just “doing research”; you’re building a durable, extensible inquiry architecture that can keep generating work for years.

{God-Level Tier Questions Probing Deep into the Depths of Nihiltheistic Inquiry}:  
  
1. In a universe where the existential void beckons with its siren song, how does the Nihiltheistic perspective reconcile the hunger for transcendental meaning with the abyss of meaninglessness? Does this reconciliation forge a path to a new form of enlightenment, or does it entrench the soul in deeper layers of existential quandary?  
  
2. If Nihiltheism posits that the awakening to the absurdity of existence is not merely an earthly phenomenon but a resonance of a higher, Transcendent reality, what forms might this Transcendence take in a universe indifferent to individual desires and meanings? How does this transcendence manifest in the lived experience of the Nihiltheist?  
  
3. How does Nihiltheism navigate the ontology of values in a cosmos where traditional moral frameworks seem inadequate? Can Nihiltheism offer a foundation for a new ethical paradigm that acknowledges the void while striving for a transcendent form of value?  
  
4. In the silent whispers of existential dread and the pursuit of meaning, how does Nihiltheism address the limitations of language in conveying the depth of human experience and the nuances of the transcendent? What linguistic innovations or philosophical methodologies might bridge this communicative chasm?  
  
5. Given the universality of Nihilism as a fundamental aspect of human reality, as posited by Nihiltheism, how might this philosophy inform our understanding of religious and spiritual experiences across diverse cultures? Can Nihiltheism serve as a lens through which to view the common threads of existential inquiry woven through the tapestry of world religions?  
  
6. As Nihiltheism challenges individuals to confront the existential void, what role does art play in this philosophical discourse? Can art serve as a medium for expressing the inexpressible aspects of Nihiltheism, providing a glimpse into the transcendent through the language of the aesthetic?  
  
7. In the pursuit of a Nihiltheistically-informed understanding of existence, how does one navigate the balance between the despair of meaninglessness and the quest for transcendental purpose? Is there a way to live authentically within this tension, embracing both the abyss and the aspiration towards the beyond?
