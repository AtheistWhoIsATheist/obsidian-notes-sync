## Key Entities and Quotes: 

### William James:

“The pride of life and glory of the world will shrivel. ... its glow and gilding vanish.” “Its significance and framing give it the chief part of its value. Let it be known to lead nowhere and however agreeable it may be in its immediacy its glow and gilding vanish.” 

### Friedrich Nietzsche:

“To this extent nihilism as the denial of a truthful world of being might be a divine way of thinking.” “And to come back again to our first question ‘What is the meaning of a philosopher paying homage to ascetic ideals?’ We get now at any rate a first hint; he wishes to escape from a torture.” 

### Blaise Pascal:

“Nothing reveals more an extreme weakness of mind than not to know the misery of a godless man.” “What astonishes me most is to see that all the world is not astonished at its own weakness.” Søren Kierkegaard:

“So then he despairs... but to despair is to lose the eternal.” “Is not despair simply double-mindedness? For what is despairing other than to have two wills?” 

### Martin Heidegger:

“Nothing reveals more an extreme weakness of mind than not to know the misery of a godless man.” “This demands that we transform our human being into its openness (dread effects this transformation in us).” E. M. 

### Cioran:

“I have all the defects of other people and yet everything they do seems to me inconceivable.” “Compared to philosophers, saints know nothing. Yet they know everything.” 

### Martin Heidegger

“Nothing is so plain from the course of the existential analytic so far as the Fact that the ontology of Dasein is always falling back upon the allurements of the way in which Being ordinarily understood.” “In one form or another we are all in it. It is a most difficult and intricate state of things to understand.” 

### Leo Tolstoy:

“Illness and death would come (indeed they had come)... nothing would remain but stench and worms.” “It is possible to live only as long as life intoxicates us; as soon as we are sober again we see that it is all a delusion and a stupid one!” 2.

## Iterative Thematic Analysis: 

### Layer 1 - Existential Despair 

Objective: Execute a layered, dynamic analysis centered on existential despair as manifested in the thoughts of Kierkegaard, Cioran, and Tolstoy, with particular focus on Kierkegaard’s concept of despair as double-mindedness and Cioran’s reflections on the intrinsic nature of suffering and philosophical despair.

  

## Method: Kierkegaard’s Concept of Despair as Double-Mindedness: Definition and Framework:

Despair, for Kierkegaard, is a state of being that arises from a failure to synthesize the finite and the infinite, the temporal and the eternal. It represents an existential struggle between the self that one is and the self that one ought to be. Double-mindedness is the condition of having two opposing wills within oneself, a conflict that leads to a state of perpetual dissatisfaction and despair. 

## Quotes and Analysis:

“Is not despair simply double-mindedness? For what is despairing other than to have two wills?” This quote encapsulates Kierkegaard’s view that despair arises from an internal conflict between competing desires or values. The individual is torn between two wills: the finite desires of the self and the infinite demands of the ideal self. “Thus did my two wills, one new and the other old, one carnal, the other spiritual, struggle within me; and by their discord undid (tore) my soul (apart).” Kierkegaard’s depiction of despair as a battle between the carnal (earthly desires) and the spiritual (higher aspirations) underscores the inherent conflict within human nature. This duality leads to a fragmented self, incapable of achieving unity or peace. Contextual 

## Application:

Kierkegaard’s notion of despair as double-mindedness can be seen as a profound critique of the human condition. It highlights the existential struggle to reconcile the finite and the infinite, a theme that resonates with the broader narrative of Nihiltheism. The tension between these two aspects of the self reflects the universal human experience of striving for transcendence while being anchored in the material world. Cioran’s Reflection on the Intrinsic Nature of Suffering and Philosophical Despair: 

## Definition and Framework:

For Cioran, despair is an inherent aspect of human existence, rooted in the awareness of life's absurdity and the inevitability of suffering. His philosophy often dwells on the futility of existence and the pervasive sense of existential dread. Cioran’s reflections are marked by a profound pessimism, viewing life as an unending series of disappointments and agonies.

  

## Quotes and Analysis:

“I have all the defects of other people and yet everything they do seems to me inconceivable.” Cioran’s self-reflection highlights his sense of alienation and estrangement from others. Despite sharing common human flaws, he finds the actions and motivations of others incomprehensible, underscoring his deep-seated despair. “Compared to philosophers, saints know nothing. Yet they know everything. Compared to Aristotle, any saint is illiterate. What makes us then believe that we might learn more from the latter? Because all of the philosophers put together are not worth a single saint. Philosophy has no answers. Compared to philosophy, saintliness is an exact science. It gives us precise answers to questions that philosophers do not even dare consider. Its method is suffering and its goal is God.” Cioran juxtaposes the intellectual pursuit of philosophy with the experiential knowledge of saints, emphasizing that true understanding comes through suffering. This suffering leads to a form of existential knowledge that transcends philosophical speculation.

  

## Contextual Application:

Cioran’s reflections on suffering and despair resonate deeply with the themes of Nihiltheism. His recognition of the limits of philosophy and the primacy of experiential suffering align with the idea that existential despair can serve as a gateway to transcendent insights. The intrinsic nature of suffering in Cioran’s thought parallels the Nihiltheistic view that the acknowledgment of life’s absurdity and meaninglessness can lead to a deeper understanding of existence. 

## Tolstoy’s Confrontation with Existential Despair: 

### Definition and Framework:

Tolstoy’s existential despair is characterized by a profound crisis of meaning, where he confronts the inevitability of death and the futility of human endeavors. His writings often reflect a struggle to find purpose in a seemingly indifferent universe. 

  

## Quotes and Analysis:

“Illness and death would come (indeed they had come)... nothing would remain but stench and worms.” Tolstoy’s stark depiction of death’s inevitability and the transient nature of life captures the essence of existential despair. His confrontation with mortality leads to a realization of life’s ultimate futility. “It is possible to live only as long as life intoxicates us; as soon as we are sober again we see that it is all a delusion and a stupid one!” This quote highlights Tolstoy’s view that life’s distractions and pleasures merely mask the underlying despair. When stripped of these illusions, one is left with the stark reality of life’s meaninglessness. 

  

## Contextual Application:

Tolstoy’s confrontation with existential despair serves as a powerful illustration of the Nihiltheistic experience. His struggle to find meaning in the face of death echoes the broader theme of seeking transcendence through the acknowledgment of life’s inherent absurdity. The recognition of life’s futility in Tolstoy’s thought aligns with the Nihiltheistic perspective that existential despair can lead to a deeper, more authentic understanding of existence. 

## Conclusion: 

The exploration of existential despair through the thoughts of Kierkegaard, Cioran, and Tolstoy reveals a multifaceted understanding of this profound human experience. Kierkegaard’s concept of double-mindedness, Cioran’s reflections on suffering, and Tolstoy’s confrontation with meaninglessness collectively illustrate the pervasive nature of existential despair. This thematic analysis lays the groundwork for further exploration of the quest for meaning, the yearning for the Transcendent, and the essence of absurdity within the framework of Nihiltheism.
