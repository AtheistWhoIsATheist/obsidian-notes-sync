## Suffering and Renunciation

Buddhism and Christianity are born out of suffering and the desire for revenge and spite. Witnessing pain, old age, and death leads to renunciation.

Renunciation does not justify despising others' pleasure or condemning their joy.

Envy often motivates acts of condemnation.

## Seeking Solitude and Happiness

Thenarrator,aShâman,seeksawaytoescapeoldage,disease,anddeath.

The search for happiness lies in something permanent and unaffected by worldly matters.

Solitude and repose in an unfrequented place are desired to destroy thoughts about the world.

The narrator values a happiness that is independent of wealth, beauty, and worldly love.

## Kierkegaard's Self-Understanding

Kierkegaard understands himself only in a religious way, alone before God. He feels a wall of misunderstanding between himself and others.

He lacks a common language with others.

He questions whether he is truly gifted or fit for anything.

## Solitude and Introspection

Solitude can be a portal to unexpected revelations and encounters with mystery. Melancholy can lead to a sense of loneliness and a desire for interior and exterior infinity. Turning inward allows for introspection and the discovery of what is already within us. The contemplative's outward stillness is necessary for inward work.

## Recollection and Plato

Recollection is mentioned in relation to Plato.

Cioran's quote suggests that everything we need to know is already within us. This internal knowledge is essential for truth to exist.

## Miguel Unomas on Quietism/Contemplation

The "quiet" of the contemplative is paradoxical and necessary for inner work. Are solitude and suffering consequences or preliminaries to Nihilism?

Does solitude reveal the Nothing of the world and lead to Nihilism?

Does solitude fight the divided-self and bring on Nihilism?

## Cioran and Solitude

Both Cioran and Koestler felt that solitude enhanced their appreciation and sympathy for others.

Solitude put them in touch with a higher order of reality. They found it difficult to express this experience in words.

They did not subscribe to any religious beliefs, but felt the existence of something indefinable or expressed in symbols.

They became more aware of the horrors lurking beneath the surface. Solitude provided a feeling of inner freedom and a dialogue with existence.

## Anthony Storr - Solitude

Within the panicked tragedy of subjectivity, solitude brings a calm sense of being. Solitude is a way to wash away absurdities.

Solitude is impractical but necessary.

## Quietism

Solitude is a means to attain a high state of mind. Solitude allows for a dialogue with life and death. Solitude leads to a glimpse of heaven in hell.

Theresa of Avila

God is found within oneself, not in external places.

## Kierkegaard

Inwardness is eternity or the constituent of the eternal in the human being. Solitude allows for diving into internal and mystical silence.

## Nietzsche

Solitude is necessary for recovery and return to oneself. Solitude provides a sense of self-mastery.

## Buddha

Finite happiness should not be pursued as everything finite passes.

## Pascal

Revelations about the world come from the deepest corner of the spirit, detached from life.

Spirituality requires solitude.

  

## Molinos

Living with purity, self-denial, and retirement leads to interior and spiritual growth.

#} Conclusion

Solitude allows for witnessing old age, pain, and death and understanding the inconstancy of things.

Renunciation can be accompanied by pride and suffering.

Ascetics believed they had overcome human weaknesses and had access to subjective eternity.
