# Solitude

Dec 1, 2023

* * *

[[renunciation]], [[asceticism]], [[quietism]]  

* * *

Turning inward, recluse, hermit, monk. Recollection/Plato- Cioran's quote about recollection. Everything that we 'need' to know is already within us, it has to be, if anything is to be true.

A more in-depth look into Quietism.

  

“My humanity is a perpetual process of self-mastery. But I need solitude-that is to say, recovery, return to myself, the breathing of free, crisp, bracing air…” Nietzsche

  

“Saintly meditation is an imprisonment in original memory.” Cioran

  

# Pascal-

“Nothing is so insufferable to man as to be completely at rest, without passions, without business, without diversion, without study. He then feels his nothingness, his forlornness, his insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his emptiness. There will immediately arise from the depth of his heart weariness, gloom, sadness, fretfulness, vexation, despair.”

  

“...I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact, that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber.”

  

# Kierkegaard

“On the other hand, he often feels a need of solitude, which for him is a vital necessity -- sometimes like breathing, at other times like sleeping. The fact that he feels this vital necessity more than other men is also a sign that he has a deeper nature. Generally the need of solitude is a sign that there is spirit in a man after all, and it is a measure for what spirit there is. The purely twaddling inhuman and too-human men are to such a degree without feeling for the need of solitude that like a certain species of social birds (the so-called love birds) they promptly die if for an instant they have to be alone. As the little child must be put to sleep by a lullaby, so these men need the tranquilizing hum of society before they are able to eat, drink, sleep, pray, fall in love, etc. But in ancient times as well as in the Middle Ages people were aware of the need of solitude and had respect for what it signifies. In the constant sociability of our age people shudder at solitude to such a degree that they know no other use to put it to but (oh, admirable epigram!) as a punishment for criminals. But after all it is a fact that in our age it is a crime to have spirit, so it is natural that such people, the lovers of solitude, are included in the same class with criminals.”

  

“But—and here lies Kierkegaard's final question—has despair the power to dispel the fear of Nothingness?”

  

# Cioran

“...revelations about the world spring from the deepest corner of the spirit, from the place where it has detached itself from life, from the wound of life. to achieve spirituality, one must be very lonely. so much death-in-life and so many inner conflagrations.”

  

“i see a form of madness, not of knowledge, in the ecstasy of life's ultimate origins. You cannot experience it except in solitude, when you feel as if you were floating above the world. solitude is the proper milieu for madness. it is noteworthy that even the skeptic can experience this kind of ecstasy. does not the madness of ecstasy reveal itself through this odd combination of certitude and essence with doubt and despair?”

  

“isn't intense subjectivity the way to attain universality, exactly as one enters eternity through the instant? men value solitude so little! they condemn the sterility of all that it has produced and give praise exclusively to social values, for they cherish the illusion that they have all contributed to their creation. they all aspire to great achievements through which they hope to attain immortality. as if they will not crumble into dust!”

  

“Without my solitude I would be nothing but another clown.” (great way to describe Heidegger, or many others, ideas of 'always falling')

  

This will be the 'conclusion' of what I write- “so you witnessed old age, pain, and death and told yourself that pleasure is an illusion and that the pleasure seekers do not understand the inconstancy of things. then you shunned the world, persuaded that nothing will endure. "i will not return," you proclaimed, "before i have escaped birth, old age, and death." there is much pride and suffering in every renunciation. instead of retreating discreetly, without a big show of revolt and hatred, you denounce, emphatically and haughtily, others' ignorance and illusions; you condemn their pleasures. the ascetics, who renounced life and fled into the desert, were convinced that they had overcome all human weaknesses. the belief that they had access to a subjective eternity gave them the illusion of total liberation. nonetheless, their condemnation of pleasure and their contempt for humanity betray their inability to actually free themselves. were i to withdraw into the most fearsome desert, renounce everything, and live in absolute solitude, still I would never dream of despising men and their pleasure. since I cannot really enter eternity through renunciation and solitude, since I shall die like the rest, why despise them, why call my way the only true one? all the great prophets lack discretion and human understanding. i witness pain, old age, death, and i know that they cannot be overcome; but why should i spoil another's enjoyment with my knowledge? suffering and the consciousness of its in escapability lead to renunciation; yet nothing would induce me, not even if i were to become a leper, to condemn another's joy. there is much envy in every act of condemnation. Buddhism and christianity are the revenge and the spite of those who suffer.”

  

“man grows wings in melancholy not in order to enjoy the world but in order to be alone. what

is the meaning of loneliness in melancholy? isn't it related to the feeling of interior and exterior infinity?”

  

# Buddha

“"I am a Shâman, depressed and sad at thought of age, disease, and death; I have left my home to seek some way of rescue, but everywhere I find old age, disease, and death; all things hasten to decay and there is no permanency. Therefore I search for the happiness of something that decays not, that never perishes, that never knows beginning, that looks with equal mind on enemy and friend, that heeds not wealth nor beauty; the happiness of one who finds repose alone in solitude, in some unfrequented dell, free from molestation, all thoughts about the world destroyed; dwelling in some lonely hermitage, untouched by any worldly source of pollution, begging for food sufficient for the body."”

  

# Edgar Saltus

“The love of solitude, however, cannot be considered otherwise than as an acquired taste; it must come as the result of experience and reflection, and advance with the development of the intellect as well as with the progress of age. A child will cry with fright if it be left alone even for a moment; in boyhood, solitude is a severe penance; young men are eminently sociable, and it is only the more elevated among them who from time to time wander off by themselves; but even so, a day passed in strict seclusion is no easy matter. In middle age, it is not so difficult, while to the aged, solitude seems the natural element. But in each individual, separately considered, the growth of the inclination for solitude is always in proportion to the strength of the intellect, and, according to Schopenhauer, it is never thoroughly matured until the individual becomes firmly convinced that society is the most disagreeable of all the unpleasant things in the world.” Saltus

  

# Molinos

“The way to attain that high state of a Mind reformed, whereby a man immediately gets to the greatest Good, to our first Original, and to the highest Peace, is his Nothingness: Endeavour, O Soul, to be always buried in that misery. This Nothing, and this acknowledged Misery, is the means by which the Lord works wonders in thy Soul. Cloath thy self with this Nothing, and with this Misery, and see that this Misery and this Nothing be thy continual Food and Habitation, even to the casting down thy self low therein; and then I assure thee, that thou being in that manner, the Nothing, the Lord will be the Whole in thy Soul.”

  

“If from the Chaos of Nothing, his Omnipotence has produced so many wonders what will he do in thy Soul, created after his own Image and Likeness, if thou keepest constant quiet, and resigned, with a true knowledge of thy Nothing? Happy Soul, which, even when ‘ti disturbed, afflicted and disconsolated, keeps steady there within, without going forth to declare exteriour Comfort.”

  

“But the happy Soul which is gotten to this holy hatred of it self, lives overwhelmed, drowned and swallowed up in the depth of its own Nothing.”

  

“How well didst thou know how to dive into that internal and mistical Silence, and to distinguish betwixt the outward and inward Man?”

  

“In a word, till the Soul be purified in the Fire of Inward Pain, it will never get to a State of Renovation, of Transformation, of perfect Contemplation, of divine Wisdom and affective Union.”

  

“The Senses are not capable of divine Blessings; hence if thou would be Happy and Wise; be Silent and Believe; Suffer and have Patience; be Confident and Walk on; it concerns thee far more to hold thy Peace, and to let thy self be guided by the hand of God, than to enjoy all the Goods of this World. And though it seem to thee, that thou does nothing at all, and art idle being so Dumb and Resigned; yet it is of infinite fruit.”

  

“All the Knowledge and Union with God , arises from suffering, which is the truest proof of love.” (maybe have sections on suffering and/or renunciation)

  

“...surrounded by temptations, darkness, anguish, affliction, sorrows and rigid drowths, doth taste of Death every moment in its painful Torment and tremendous Desolation, without feeling the least comfort, with an affliction so great, that the pain of it seems nothing else but a Death prolonged, and a continual Martyrdom...”

  

“...in order to the interior and spiritual Souls, must be to endeavor to live with greater Purity and Self-denial, with an universal taking ones self off from the World, with an inward Mortification and continual Retirement...”

  

“If from the Chaos of Nothing, his Omnipotence has produced so many wonders, what will he do in thy Soul, created after his own Image and Likeness, if thou keepest constant quiet, and resigned, with a true knowledge of thy Nothing?” (this is good)

  

Grey and Koestler- “Both felt that solitude enhanced their appreciation of, and sympathy with, their fellow man. Both had intense experiences of feeling that some kind of higher order of reality existed with which solitude put then in touch. Both felt that trying to put this experience into words tended to trivialize it, because words could not really express it. Although neither man subscribed to any orthodox religious belief, both agreed that they had felt the abstract existence of something which was indefinable or which could only be expressed in symbols...he had also become more aware of horrors lurking under the surface...'feeling of inner freedom, of being alone and confronted with ultimate realities instead of with your bank statement. Your bank statement and other trivialities are again a kind of confinement. Not in space but in spiritual space...So you have got a dialogue with existence. A dialogue with life, a dialogue with death.' ...a courageous few discover that, when in hell, they are granted a glimpse of heaven.” 

_Anthony Storr- Solitude_

  
Are 'solitude' and 'suffering' consequences or preliminaries to Nihilism? Does the revealing of the Nothing of the world confine one to solitude? Or does solitude, by fighting the divided-self, the natural self, bring on Nihilism?  
“See how we are flying like hunted hares from all that is terrible, and like them, hiding our heads and thinking we are safe. See how the whole world is flying from everything terrible.” 

_Vivekananda_

   
“To be sure, some men who in the world of things make do with experiencing and using have constructed for themselves an idea annex or superstructure in which they find refuge and reassurance in the face of intimations of nothingness.” 

_Buber_

“But isn't solitude, too, a portal? Does it not happen sometimes in the stillest lonesomeness that we unexpectedly behold? Cannot intercourse with oneself change mysteriously into intercourse with mystery?” 

  

  

“From my early youth," says Kierkegaard, "I have lived a perpetual contradiction: to others I appear uncommonly gifted, but in the depths of my soul I know that I am fit for nothing." \[IV, 218\] Who was right, those others who considered Kierkegaard to be uncommonly gifted, or the man himself who knew that he was fit for nothing? Can one even pose such a question in regard to Kierkegaard? He himself says: "It is only in a religious way that I can understand myself, alone before God. But between me and others there stands the wall of misunderstanding. I have no common language with them.” 

_Shestov_

  

“We must not strive for finite happiness—must not aim for the flocks and lands of Job, or the return of a son, or the winning of the king's daughter—for everything finite passes; such is the fundamental law of existence.” (not sure if this is Shestov or Shestov quoting Kierkegaard)

  

Within the panicked tragedy of subjectivity, there emerges a calm sense of being that washes away the absurdities, yet only within the impractical confines of solitude.

  

“Augustine testifies that neither in the house, nor in the church, nor anywhere else, did he find God, till once he had found Him in himself. Nor had he need to go up to heaven, but only down into himself to find God.”

_Theresa of Avila_

“As soon as inwardness is lacking, the spirit is finitized. Inwardness is therefore eternity or the constituent of the eternal in the human being.” 

_Kierkegaard_

  

“...not knowing that youthful beauty soon falls, destroyed by old age and death, fading and perishing! This is the great distress! What ignorance and delusion (he reflected) overshadow their minds: "Surely they ought to consider old age, disease, and death, and day and night stir themselves up to exertion, whilst this sharp double-edged sword hangs over the neck. What room for sport or laughter, beholding those monsters, old age, disease, and death? A man who is unable to resort to this inward knowledge, what is he but a wooden or a plaster man, what heart-consideration in such a case!' (me: there is a cobra at the door)

  

“The paradoxical "quiet" of the contemplative is but the outward stillness essential to inward work.”

**_Miguel Unomas_**

“These words mark the frontier between _the true and healthy mystic state of "Quiet" and its morbid perversion in "Quietism": the difference between the tense stillness of the athlete and the limp passivity of the sluggard, who is really lazy, though he looks resigned._ True "Quiet" is a means, not an end: is actively embraced, not passively endured. It is a phase in the self's growth in contemplation; a bridge which leads from its old and uncoordinated life of activity to its new unified life of deep action--the real "mystic life" of man.”

**_Underhill_**
