# Renunciation within Nihiltheism
7/25/24 
[[renunciation]]


Nihiltheism views a meaningless existence as an inherent truth and proposes that the act of **renunciation**, a retreat from active engagement with the world, offers a path towards transcendence.

- Sources describe the act of renunciation as a way to confront the "Nothingness" of existence, not to escape from it, but to engage with it directly. This engagement aims to lead towards a mystical experience of the transcendent reality that exists alongside the meaningless existence.
- The concept of inherent meaninglessness in Nihiltheism aligns with traditional Nihilism. However, Nihiltheism differentiates itself by seeking to transcend this meaninglessness by embracing a higher, possibly divine, reality through the acceptance of "Nothingness".
- Renunciation in this context is not simply a rejection of worldly values but a method to facilitate a deeper understanding of existence by engaging with the perceived void.
- Sources suggest that this engagement allows for a "revaluation of values," moving away from external achievements and societal norms towards introspection and acceptance of existential insignificance. This revaluation emphasizes internal reflection over external action as a response to meaninglessness.
- This perspective echoes the philosophical idea that philosophy should be a preparation for death, urging individuals to engage with the mystery and wonder of existence even in the face of its apparent meaninglessness.
- It is important to note that the concept of "transcendence" in Nihiltheism doesn't necessarily equate to traditional religious interpretations. It refers to a shift in understanding and experience that acknowledges a reality beyond the material world, accessed through the acceptance of meaninglessness.
