# Nothingness

**Nothingness is a central concept in Nihiltheism, a philosophy that embraces a traditional view of nihilism, along with the claim that the essential Nothingness of existence is seen as a construct, and possibly the embodiment of the Transcendent/Divine, i.e. 'God'.**

The experience of Nihilism is described not just as a philosophical concept, but as a profound and often disturbing experience that challenges one’s understanding of existence and meaning. This experience is portrayed as transformative, leading to a deeper understanding of the void and meaninglessness that underlies human existence.

Nihilism is seen as a necessary step in transcending traditional philosophical discourse. The text argues that traditional philosophical language is inadequate for capturing the full depth of the Nihilistic experience and calls for the development of a new language of Nihilism.

The text also explores the relationship between Nihilism and religion, arguing that Nihilism can be seen as a form of religious experience. It draws on the work of mystics and theologians to show how the experience of Nothingness can lead to a deeper understanding of the divine.

Ultimately, the text argues that Nihilism is not a cause for despair, but rather an opportunity for a more profound and authentic engagement with the world. It calls for a new way of thinking about Nihilism, one that embraces the void and finds meaning in the face of meaninglessness.

**Here are some key points to remember about Nothingness:**

- It is a central concept in Nihiltheism.
- It is experienced as a void or emptiness that underlies all of existence and human existence is an experience of this void.
- This experience can be transformative, leading to a deeper understanding of the world and oneself.
- Nihilism is not a cause for despair, but rather an opportunity for a more profound and authentic engagement with the world.
