# Report: Heidegger’s Concept of Anxiety - The Most Revelatory of Moods

## Document Overview

**Author:** John Thomas Whalen (Fordham University)  
**Publication:** Akadimia Filosofia, Volume 1, Issue 1 (May 2015)  
**Focus:** Analysis of Heidegger’s philosophical treatment of anxiety in “Being and Time”

## Central Thesis

Whalen explores why anxiety holds such exceptional revelatory power in Heidegger’s philosophical framework. Unlike other moods that help us engage with the world, anxiety uniquely pulls us away from worldly engagement, revealing fundamental structures of human existence (Dasein) that remain hidden in everyday life.

## Key Philosophical Distinctions

### Anxiety vs. Fear

Heidegger makes a crucial distinction between anxiety and fear that separates his analysis from psychological approaches:

**Fear:**

- Directed at specific innerworldly beings or events
- Encourages deeper engagement with the world
- Heightens circumspection and practical activity
- Has a definite object that can be identified and potentially overcome

**Anxiety:**

- Not directed at any specific innerworldly being
- Pulls us away from worldly engagement
- Has no definite object (“what is threatening is nowhere”)
- Cannot be fled from or conquered in conventional ways

### Ontological vs. Ontic Analysis

Whalen emphasizes that Heidegger’s treatment differs fundamentally from psychological approaches:

- **Psychological (Ontic):** Studies anxiety as an empirical phenomenon, often viewing it as stemming from fear
- **Heideggerean (Ontological):** Examines anxiety as revealing fundamental structures of human existence

## The Revelatory Function of Anxiety

### Loss of Significance

In anxiety, the world loses its significance while retaining its meaning structure:

- We still see hammers as tools for hammering, pens for writing
- However, these activities no longer seem relevant or important
- The “totality of relevance” becomes insignificant

### Uncanniness and Individuation

Anxiety produces a state of “uncanniness” where:

- Dasein no longer feels at home in the world
- The world appears “as if from the outside”
- Dasein becomes fundamentally alone and individuated
- This “existential solipsism” reveals our authentic possibilities

### Disclosure of Authentic Possibilities

Anxiety serves as a bridge to authenticity by:

- Revealing that our usual ways of being are prescribed by “the they” (das man)
- Showing us that we haven’t authentically chosen our possibilities
- Opening space for guilt, conscience, and resoluteness to emerge

## Connection to Being-Towards-Death

Anxiety manifests most profoundly in Heidegger’s concept of “Being-towards-death”:

- Death anxiety is not fear of biological perishing
- It’s anxiety about the possibility of impossibility itself
- This reveals our finite nature and authentic temporal structure
- Unlike fear of death (which focuses on innerworldly threats), anxiety toward death confronts “the nothing”

## Anxiety’s Structural Role in Being and Time

Whalen demonstrates how anxiety serves as a crucial bridge in Heidegger’s work:

- **Division One:** Examines everyday, inauthentic existence
- **Division Two:** Explores authentic existence and temporality
- **Anxiety:** Provides the transition by revealing the inadequacy of everyday understanding

Through anxiety, fundamental existential structures emerge:

1. **Guilt:** Recognition of responsibility for our ways of being
2. **Call of Conscience:** Summons to authentic existence
3. **Resoluteness:** Embracing responsibility for our choices

## Methodological Significance

Anxiety serves a unique methodological function in Heidegger’s fundamental ontology:

- Most moods help us engage with specific aspects of the world
- Only anxiety reveals “Dasein in its wholeness”
- This makes possible the comprehensive existential analysis Heidegger seeks

## Contemporary Relevance

Whalen notes that Heidegger’s anxiety is often misunderstood because:

- It’s an extremely rare and subtle phenomenon
- It differs significantly from common psychological usage
- It can occur during ordinary moments (sitting in a chair, at parties) rather than just crises
- The experience is so subtle that people may not recognize they’ve felt it

## Critical Observations

The paper acknowledges several challenges to Heidegger’s approach:

- **Empirical objections:** Naturalistic thinkers question examining existence through moods rather than empirical observation
- **Terminological confusion:** “Angst” might be better translated as “dread” than “anxiety”
- **Rarity:** If authentic anxiety is so rare, how can it ground fundamental ontology?

Whalen addresses these by noting that even empirical approaches presuppose the very attunement they seek to study objectively.

## Conclusion

Anxiety emerges as uniquely revelatory because it alone among moods reveals the world as a whole by withdrawing significance from particular engagements. This withdrawal creates the existential space necessary for authentic self-understanding and genuine choice. Rather than being merely a negative emotional state, anxiety becomes the gateway to authentic existence and philosophical insight into the fundamental structures of human being.

The paper successfully demonstrates why Heidegger considers anxiety “the most revelatory of moods” - not because it reveals specific truths about the world, but because it reveals the very structure of our being-in-the-world itself.
