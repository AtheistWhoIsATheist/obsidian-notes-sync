{{ Mitchell Heisman's Documented Struggle with Nihilism and Transcendence

  

_Last Chapter_   
Happiness, Wonder, Laughter, Love   
People have told you there’s nothing better than   
love . . .1430  
—LOUIS-FERDINAND CÉLINE, JOURNEY TO THE   
END OF THE NIGHT  
Now, before I blow my brains out, I should like to point   
out that the most basic issue at the very center of this work is   
THE PUNCHLINE   
1875   
not biology, race, or technology; it is nihilism. Ultimately,   
this is an experiment in nihilism. Every word, every thought,   
and every emotion come back to one core problem: life is   
meaningless. The experiment in nihilism is to seek out and   
expose every illusion and every myth, wherever it may lead,   
no matter what, even if it kills us.   
Allan Bloom, in Love and Friendship, wrote:   
What has disappeared is the risk and the hope of human   
connectedness embedded in eros. Ours is a language that   
reduces the longing for an other to the need for individual,   
private satisfaction and safety….The de-eroticization of the   
world, a companion of its disenchantment is a complex   
phenomenon. It seems to result from a combination of   
causes—our democratic regime and its tendencies toward   
leveling and self-protection, a reductionist-materialist   
science that inevitably interprets eros as sex, and the   
atmosphere generated by “the death of God” and of the   
subordinate god, Eros.1431  
Who is to say that the life of a saint, an artist, or a   
philosopher is superior to a life spent sniffing glue? While   
liberalism tends to be reductionistic on a social level, its   
mediocrity is revealed in its resistance to applying the same   
scientific reductionism to the level of a human individual.   
More specifically, liberals tend to resist the implications of   
the contemporary scientific view that human beings are   
material or physical things.   
Liberals are not at all fully nihilistic. In part, there is the   
practical belief in values vaguely corresponding to human   
rights. But more fundamentally, “secularists” implicitly   
believe in a religion of the common emotions. They   
generally believe that meaning is to be found in the material,   
biochemical processes that humans experience as emotions.   
MITCHELL HEISMAN   
1876  
They generally believe that it actually means something   
when these old biological mechanisms produce the familiar   
emotional routines.   
While one may feel compassion, does this mean that one   
lacks the capacity to discipline one’s self from being mastered  
by that impulse. That people are mastered by such impulses   
is only another confirmation of Darwin’s insight that   
humans are animals. Most humans are driven   
overwhelmingly by instinct and emotion. The “secular”   
belief in emotions is the last degenerate remains of   
romanticism and religion.   
The modernistic project did not destroy romanticism, it   
only reduced to a common level. Modernity and   
postmodernity retain romanticism by reducing the belief in   
emotion to the most common experiences, i.e. hunger, fear of   
death, and lust. The emotional joy of cynical laughter could   
be considered characteristic of the new romanticism.   
Emotions are at the root of myths. To engage in human   
relationships is to dwell within a mythological world.   
Outside that is, as far as I can see, a material, physical world   
indifferent to the existence or non-existence of humans and   
not discernable partial to the senseless will to live.   
To aestheticize or romanticize this experiment in death or   
this work is to misunderstand it. Most people are slaves to   
the aestheticization or romanticization of death. Yet if this   
mode of interpretation is valid at all, try viewing death, not   
as a tragedy, but as a comedy. If the progress of reason leads   
to nihilism, then Enlightenment levity might as well   
culminate in a punchline!   
If reason cannot determine fundamental values, then   
reason can be used to justify literally anything. A truly   
“rational regime”, consequently, would culminate not in a   
net increase in order, but anarchy, entropy, and finally,   
THE PUNCHLINE   
1877   
death. If life is not fundamentally more rational than death,   
then death is the endpoint uncovered by the quest to   
overcome prejudice in the name of Enlightenment.   
Were Nietzsche and the Athenians right about Socrates?   
Reason appears unable to determine values and, therefore,   
the entire Western pretension to rationalism is a kind of joke.   
And even worse, it’s not even a good joke. Yet I have to   
laugh. And as I laugh, I observe myself laughing. And as I   
observe myself laughing, I reflect that humans are material   
animals and that my own laughter must in some way be   
attributable to a genetic mechanism that evolved through   
natural selection.   
From a Darwinistic view, every capacity for emotion   
evolved as a product of genetic adaptation. Emotions, then,   
are biochemical-based illusions that evolved to propagate   
genes. Pleasure, happiness, emotions, and desire: these are   
the evolutionary tricks that promoted the survival of our   
ancestors. The “happiness” and “sadness” of present day   
humans are the genetically adaptations of generations of   
ancestors.   
This is “happiness”, the great goal of humanity has been   
striving for: a particular configuration of biochemical   
reactions. Why, not, then, drug one’s self into a state of   
“happiness”? If evolution had taken a different turn at some   
early point, a completely different configuration of stimuli   
would produce biochemical reactions of “happiness”. It just   
so happens, however, that evolutionary path taken by   
innumerable ancestors yields these particular, incidental,   
prejudices of human nature.   
Wild, untamed sexual passion can clearly be adaptive for   
propagating the selfish genes. The genetic program for these   
“romantic” behaviors, like clockwork, are passed on,   
generation after generation. Ancestor after ancestor executed   
MITCHELL HEISMAN   
1878  
the same genetic program for romantic sexual passion, and   
contemporary humans are only repeating the script. The   
entire catalog of romantic behaviors from love to selective   
altruism has its basics encoded in the code of the selfish   
genes. Even as condoms and birth control subvert the genes   
themselves, people are still content to obey their genes   
towards genetically maladaptive ends. Such people   
“outsmart” their genes, only to be duped into belief that   
their instincts and emotions were something more   
manipulations by their genes in the first place.   
For some, the meaninglessness gleaned from a scientific   
view of life leads to nausea, angst, and nihilistic despair. I   
reject this attitude on the grounds that nausea, angst, and   
nihilistic despair also originate in material reactions in the   
brain. What does despair mean to someone who interprets   
that emotion as a chemical reaction in the brain? The process   
of disillusionment can also be disillusioned and deaestheticized.   
If science is to continue its purposeless advance, then   
curiosity, wonder, and happiness must be disenchanted and   
vivisected. Science and philosophy might be motivated by a   
sense of poetic wonder, but what happens when wonder,   
curiosity, and the joy of understanding have been reduced   
and explained in terms of chemical reactions of the brain. Is   
it possible to synthesize this knowledge with the experience   
of it? How far is one willing to lie to one’s self in the belief of   
the goodness of the truth when science has conquered the   
non-scientific behaviors that motivate science?   
If we have a technical understanding of the biochemical   
basis of the experience of curiosity, wonder, amazement,   
awe, and mystery themselves, does this diminish our   
experience of them? Do these experiences fall into the same   
category as myths, lies, and illusions? What rational basis is   
THE PUNCHLINE   
1879   
there to treat them any differently? What then, does it mean to lead a “rational life”? If science and knowledge are supposedly pursued for its own sake, then how about the   
knowledge that life has no discernable purpose, knowledge that happiness, wonder, and curiosity are based in material organizations that were likely selected for their evolutionary   
survival value, and knowledge that there is no fundamentally rational basis for choosing life over death.  Nihilism, noted Friedrich Nietzsche, “represents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great values and ideals”.1432 This is the bankrupt, philosophical disaster area   
the West dwells in. I see no “bottom”, no limits to stop the freefall into value nothingness. Implicit in nihilism is the   
collapse of the entire human cause. The ultimate logical conclusion of Western values is the rational self-destruction   
of the West.   
  

Is this absurd? If this is absurd then it must also be absurd that I rage at the entire cosmos for having no ultimate   
meaning. But there is no reason to be pessimistic. There is no justification whatsoever for a negative attitude! There is no justification whatsoever for a positive attitude! There is no   
justification whatsoever for a neutral attitude! Who knows what will happen with certainty? I could be strolling down the street, being beautiful, on my way to kill myself, when suddenly I am run over by a bus. But wait a minute. Why am I doing this? Ah, yes, now I   
remember the punchline:   
I’ll try anything once!   
There is nothing to take seriously!   
MITCHELL HEISMAN   
1880  
The student Doko came to a Zen master, and said: “I am   
seeking the truth. In what state of mind should I train   
myself, so as to find it?”   
Said the master, “There is no mind, so you cannot put it in   
any state. There is no truth, so you cannot train yourself for   
it.”   
“If there is no mind to train, and no truth to find, why do   
you have these monks gather before you every day to study   
Zen and train themselves for this study?”   
“But I haven’t an inch of room here,” said the master, “so   
how could the monks gather? I have no tongue, so how   
could I call them together or teach them?”   
“Oh, how can you lie like this?” asked Doko.   
“But if I have no tongue to talk to others, how can I lie to   
you?” asked the master.   
Then Doko said sadly, “I cannot follow you. I cannot   
understand you.”   
“I cannot understand myself,” said the master

  

While Heisman grappled deeply with nihilism, there are indications that he sensed something beyond pure materialism, even if he couldn't fully articulate or embrace it. His mention of finding transcendence in Bach's music, and his insight about monotheism potentially arising from "ruthless realism", suggest he was wrestling with the possibility of meaning beyond nihilism. 

  

However, Heisman ultimately seemed unable to move past a naturalistic worldview, despite hints that he yearned for something more. This highlights the difficulty of finding a language to express transcendence within a nihilistic framework. Heisman's tragic end illustrates the potentially destructive power of nihilism when not balanced by a sense of the transcendent.

  

The Limits of Purely Rational Approaches

  

Heisman's attempt to live out nihilism to its logical conclusion through "honesty to the point of absurdity" demonstrates the limits of a purely rational, materialist approach to existence. As Underhill noted, escaping "the horrors of nihilism" ultimately requires some form of faith or intuition of meaning beyond what can be rationally proven.

  

This connects to critiques of overly rationalistic philosophy that fails to grapple with the lived experience of human existence. As the text states: "The analytic tradition of philosophy is too distant from the existential conditions of man." Pure logic and rationality, divorced from deeper intuitions of meaning, may lead to nihilistic despair.

  

Madness, Suicide, and Nihilism 

  

The text raises profound questions about the relationship between nihilism, madness, and suicide. Is some form of "madness" - a break from conventional rationality - necessary to truly confront nihilism? Is suicide a rational response to the experience of meaninglessness, as Heisman seemed to conclude?

  

The author suggests that nihilism must be distinguished from mental illness, quoting Becker's view that "Full humanness means full fear and trembling." There's an implication that the nihilistic experience, while potentially devastating, may actually represent a more clear-eyed view of reality than conventional "sanity."

  

At the same time, the text hints that suicide may not be the only or inevitable conclusion of nihilism. It asks whether there might be a way to "live alongside the Nothing" - to confront nihilism without being destroyed by it. This points to the possibility of finding meaning or transcendence within or beyond the nihilistic experience.

  

The Need for a New Language

  

A key theme that emerges is the inadequacy of existing philosophical and religious languages to fully capture the nihilistic experience. The text critiques both overly rationalistic philosophy and traditional religious frameworks as failing to grapple with the depths of meaninglessness.

  

There are hints at the need for a new way of articulating the confrontation with nothingness - one that doesn't retreat into easy answers or flee from the full implications of nihilism. The author seems to be groping towards a language that can hold both the reality of meaninglessness and the possibility of transcendence.

  

This connects to Heidegger's call for "a more original inquiry" that goes beyond conventional logic and rationality. It suggests that truly engaging with nihilism requires new modes of thought and expression.

  

The Possibility of Transcendence Within Nihilism

  

While the text deeply explores the destructive power of nihilism, it also points to the possibility of finding something beyond pure negation. The discussion of mystical experiences and moments of transcendence suggests that confronting nothingness may paradoxically open up awareness of a deeper reality.

  

The author seems to be exploring whether nihilism itself might contain the seeds of its own overcoming - whether the experience of meaninglessness, pursued to its depths, might reveal something beyond itself. This connects to ideas in mystical and apophatic traditions that see negation as a path to transcendence.

  

At the same time, the text maintains a deep skepticism, acknowledging that any glimpses of meaning or transcendence may ultimately be illusory. It walks a razor's edge between nihilistic despair and the intuition of something more.

  

Shall I continue exploring these themes and ideas further? Let me know if you'd like me to focus on any particular aspects.
