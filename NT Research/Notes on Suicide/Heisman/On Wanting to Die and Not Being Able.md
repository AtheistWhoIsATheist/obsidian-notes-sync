# On Wanting to Die and Not Being Able

8/2/24

* * *

  

# Edgar Saltus

_On Leopardi:_ “He was not much over twenty before excessive study had well-nigh ruined such health as he once possessed. The slightest application was wearisome both to eye and brain. He wandered silently about the neighboring forests, seeking solitude not only for the sake of solitude, but also perhaps for the suggestions, at once soothing and rebellious, which solitude always whispers to him who courts her truly. At other times he sat hour by hour in a state as motionless as that of catalepsy. "I am so much overcome," he wrote to a friend, "by the nothingness that surrounds me, that I do not know how I have the strength to answer your letter. If at this moment I lost my reason, I think that my insanity would consist in sitting always with eyes fixed, open-mouthed, without laughing or weeping, or changing place. I have no longer the strength to form a desire, be it even for death." (Kierkegaard, Cioran, Tillich about wanting to die but not being able to)

# Kierkegaard

“When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. _So when the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.”_ (Cioran, pg. 248, talks about wanting to die and feeling 'sorry' that he wants to die, the Abyss of all Abysses, the feeling of being trapped, maybe the most awful feeling I continually experience, Tillich on pg. 11 in _Courage_)

 **“i want to die but I am sorry that I want to die. this is the feeling experienced by those who abandon themselves to nothingness.”** (Kierkegaard, Tillich _courage to be pg 11_)
