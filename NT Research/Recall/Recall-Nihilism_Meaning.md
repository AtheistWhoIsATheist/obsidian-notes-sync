## Introduction
- James Tartaglia, a Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at Keele University, discusses the meaning of life in his work "Philosophy in a Meaningless Life."
- Tartaglia aims to reaffirm the importance of the question of life's meaning, challenging outdated positivistic views and the prevalent scientistic and anti-religious sentiments in contemporary intellectual culture.
- He criticizes contemporary value theorists for distorting the question of life's meaning and argues that it is equally relevant to both believers and non-believers.
- Tartaglia reflects on his initial interest in understanding what makes a topic philosophical and *notes the general neglect and scorn this question receives within the philosophical profession.*

## Background and Context
- He suggests that *philosophy's neglect of the meaning of life has led to its marginalization in culture*, as many people, both inside and outside the discipline, are unclear about the purpose of philosophy.
- Tartaglia believes that philosophy's lack of self-consciousness and self-confidence, particularly in relation to science, prevents it from fulfilling its proper role.
- He contrasts traditional philosophical works, which are wide-ranging and interconnected, with contemporary analytic philosophy, which he views as fragmented and science-like.
- Tartaglia expresses concern that contemporary philosophy lacks engaging "take-home messages" and that its interest is often solely professional, with researchers focusing on niche debates.
- He argues that while the scientific model of research has visible real-world effects, philosophy's impact is primarily on human understanding, making the scientific approach less suitable for the discipline.
- The author of the book 'Nihilism_Meaning' discusses the role of philosophy in providing understanding and answers to issues of natural human interest, as opposed to science which provides technological solutions and understanding that may or may not be of general interest.
- The author argues that philosophy should provide answers that cater to natural human interests, and that the traditional approach to philosophy, which has been eclipsed by the piece-meal approach, is still valuable in providing a comprehensive understanding of the world.
- The author expresses skepticism about the piece-meal approach, which involves a collective endeavor to produce philosophical understanding, and argues that it requires faith that the collation and dissemination of knowledge will ultimately transpire, rather than being indefinitely deferred.
- The author decided to write a traditional philosophy book, focusing on the topic of consciousness, which led them to explore the metaphysics of time and the connection between modern concerns about consciousness and the ancient problem of universals, as discussed by Richard Rorty in 'Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature'.
- The author struggled to formulate a physicalist account of consciousness, but eventually rejected physicalism and became anti-physicalist, which allowed them to write their book, and they began by tackling the popular notion that the question of the meaning of life is hopelessly obscure in the introduction.
- The author's journey to writing the book involved exploring the nature of philosophical inquiry, and they were influenced by the ideas of Thomas Nagel and Martin Heidegger, among others, and they ultimately arrived at the question of the meaning of life, which became the central theme of their book.
- The concept of nihilism and the meaning of life is often dismissed or avoided in intellectual culture, with some people interpreting the question of meaning as a social construct, which the author argues is a misconception stemming from 19th century overreactions to nihilism.
- The author criticizes the contemporary analytic approach to social meaning, which either dismisses or tries to pass itself off as an inquiry into the meaning of life, and regrets the tone they took in their critique, acknowledging that the philosophers they attacked have revived interest in this crucial area.
- The author's views on nihilism and social meaning have not changed, but they have come to realize the importance of courtesy and diplomacy in making critiques, and they apologize for any offense they may have caused to leading figures in the field.

## Nihilism and the Meaning of Life
- In chapter one of their book, the author argues that human life is meaningless, but this is not normally apparent because our social understanding of the world focuses our attention on goals and activities, and they claim that nihilism reveals itself through our susceptibility to boredom when our engagement with the social framework subsides.
- The author connects the question of the meaning of life to the cosmological question of why there is something rather than nothing, and argues that understanding that we cannot make sense of life and existence can satisfy our natural philosophical curiosity.
- The author critiques the existentialist analyses of boredom and anxiety by philosophers like Heidegger, and also critiques Nietzsche's conception of nihilism, which they argue is more loaded than their own understanding of the concept.
- In chapter two, the author examines the various intellectual defense mechanisms that 20th century philosophers devised to deal with nihilism, which the author believes is a response to the terror that the prospect of nihilism has inspired in many hearts, and the author references their own work, including "Tartaglia 2016a", which further develops their critique of the social meaning agenda.

## The State of Philosophy
- The concept of nihilism is often misunderstood as a threat or challenge, but it is actually a result of inherited prejudice and intellectual error, and nihilists should not be seen as absurdists because absurdity is a concept that only makes sense within a religious perspective that nihilists reject.
- Some people try to avoid nihilism by defending the humanist view that people create their own meaning, but this view is limited because it only addresses individual meaning, and the idea of a broader, social meaning requires a transcendent context that humanists do not believe in, which inevitably leads to nihilism.
- A radical form of humanism, known as relativistic scepticism, which is promoted by postmodernists, can be discounted because people can still uncover objective truths about the world, and this view is seen as an unnecessary response to nihilism.
- The author discusses their own work, including a chapter on the unity of philosophy, where they argue that philosophy is rooted in attempts to discover the meaning of life through a description of the world employing the concept of transcendence, and that the various problems of philosophy have arisen from this attempt but have become far removed from their natural sources of curiosity.
- The author references their previous work, including a journal-friendly version of their theory about the unity of philosophy, published in 2016, and notes that their views on philosophy-scepticism have evolved over time, from seeing it as a "dumb and annoying meme" to recognizing its importance.
- The author also discusses the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest works of human literature, which explores the theme of the meaning of life, and argues that the question of the meaning of life is a natural philosophical concern that is connected to other traditional areas of philosophical inquiry, such as metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.
- The author offers a constructive inquiry in philosophy inspired by Meno’s Paradox to address issues in philosophy, which they have used consistently.
- The author addresses skepticism towards philosophy, which is often criticized for lacking a unified subject matter, relying on a priori methods, and showing little progress, especially when compared to science.
- The author argues that the criticism of philosophy as an "armchair" pursuit is unfair, noting that both scientists and philosophers engage in deep thinking, often at desks.
- The author questions the notion that experimentation is the ultimate method, pondering how one might experimentally explore concepts like consciousness, the meaning of life, and the nature of philosophy.
- The author plans to explore the relationship between philosophy and science more thoroughly in a forthcoming work titled "Gods and Titans."
- The author observes that when English-speaking philosophers moved away from existential questions like the meaning of life, they lost their identity and became overly focused on science, leading to skepticism about philosophy and a fragmented analytic approach.
- A split in 20th-century philosophy is noted, with continental philosophy maintaining interest in holistic understanding and drawing inspiration from art, literature, and politics, while analytic philosophy focused on argumentative analysis.
- The author identifies with the analytic side for its clear prose and argumentative analysis but acknowledges a personal connection to continental philosophy.
- Chapter four of the text discusses the ongoing debate in analytic philosophy about consciousness, particularly whether science can fully explain it.

## Consciousness and Physicalism
- The debate is characterized by a divide between philosophers who believe consciousness poses challenges to the scientific worldview and those who believe it can be fully explained by science, leading to mutual frustration.
- The debate centers on the role of philosophy in the context of physicalism, a metaphysical position that aims to be the ultimate explanation, potentially silencing philosophical inquiry.
- Physicalism seeks to be the final metaphysical position, but in doing so, it risks forgetting its own metaphysical nature, which raises concerns about the future of philosophy.
- The author argues that if consciousness continues to contextualize the scientific worldview, philosophy will have a future; otherwise, it may not.
- The distinction between indirect and direct awareness is considered irrelevant unless one denies the existence of conscious perceptual states.
- Attempts to incorporate consciousness into the physical world lead to "revisionism," which requires altering our understanding of either consciousness or the physical world to fit physicalism.
- Revisionism is deemed untenable because our ordinary conception of consciousness persists, even among those who advocate for revisionist theories.
- The author compares the persistence of ordinary consciousness to the idea of insisting triangles have four sides, despite clear evidence to the contrary.
- The text critiques "illusionism," a form of physicalism that suggests consciousness is merely an illusion, likening it to a computer that can mimic human statements about consciousness without truly experiencing it.
- The author finds the case for physicalism weak and views it as a naïve metaphysical stance adopted due to a reverence for science.
- While physicalists, particularly "illusionists," claim that consciousness is an illusion, the author argues that this position is not convincing enough to equate human consciousness with a computer's lack of experience.
- The author argues that physicalism, a metaphysic that attempts to explain conscious experience through physical systems, is flawed because it cannot account for the emergence of consciousness from certain physical systems, and it forgets its own starting point.
- The author uses the example of color and black-and-white cameras to illustrate that physical information can explain the differences between their visual experiences, but it cannot tell us that they have visual experiences at all, highlighting the limitations of physicalism.

## The Transcendent Hypothesis
- The author proposes the "Transcendent Hypothesis" as a new solution to the problem of consciousness, which suggests that experiences, whether dream or waking, do not ontologically belong to the objective world, but are instead transcendent.
- According to the author, the Transcendent Hypothesis has implications for our understanding of the meaning of life, and it brings us to the same place as reflection on consciousness, which is that reality is transcendent.
- The author acknowledges that the idea of transcendence is often met with instinctive mistrust, particularly among those who do not think there is a meaning of life, but argues that this mistrust is mistaken and that the equilibrium lies in a combination of nihilism and transcendence.
- The author is aware that defending this combination may bifurcate readers between those who like the nihilism but not the transcendence, and those who like the transcendence but not the nihilism, and is already witnessing this reaction.
- The author's argument is part of a larger work, "Nihilism_Meaning", which explores the relationship between consciousness, transcendence, and the meaning of life, and is presented in a series of chapters, including chapter five, which provides the core of the author's metaphysic.
- The author's account of consciousness predicts the creation of differential contexts of existence, which leads to the misrepresentation of mental states and allows us to articulate a world, and this idea is a central theme in the author's theory.
- The author explains that their guiding thought about consciousness is that it creates these differential contexts, and this idea is used to make sense of distinctions between introspection and perception, appearance and reality, primary and secondary qualities, and realism and idealism.
- The concept of transcendence is introduced, and the author argues that it is not an ethereal realm, but rather everything that exists, and that our objective understanding of the world cannot capture the nature of reality, given that we are conscious and exist in the present.
- The author discusses the idea that our objective understanding, although flawed, allows us to form the reasonable hypothesis that reality is transcendent, and this idea is further developed in chapter six, which explores the connection between transcendence and the question of the meaning of life.
- In chapter six, the author examines the connection between time and transcendence, and argues that common anxieties about time are related to the philosophical claim that time is unreal, and that the author's metaphysic remains rooted and purposeful by revealing these connections.
- The author rejects Heidegger's revisionary conception of time and argues that attempts to dissipate the counterintuitive consequences of the "block universe" theory are hampered by consciousness revisionism, and instead proposes that the Transcendent Hypothesis can show us how to accept the block conception of time.
- The author concludes that there is both an objective and transcendent sense of "now", and that there is no reason to think that experience belongs to objective time rather than objective space, and that the characteristic perplexities of philosophical reflection on time result from attempting to superimpose the transcendent "now" upon the objective world.
- The author relates their position to ideas from the Chan/Zen Buddhist tradition, and argues that their theory provides a new perspective on the nature of reality and our experience of time.

## Universals and Metaphysics
- The author reflects on the concept of universals, a Western philosophical problem that has been debated for millennia, and how it relates to the idea of redness itself, beyond individual red things, and notes that this problem has become somewhat dusty and arcane, making it challenging to engage modern students.
- The author attempts to bring the concept of universals down to earth by showing that natural concerns about universals motivate Plato's metaphysics of universals and that these concerns are still relevant today, connecting the debate between nominalist and realist positions on universals to debates about consciousness and time.
- The author invokes the Transcendent Hypothesis to try to resolve the standoff between nominalist and realist positions, arguing that the problem of universals is intimately connected with consciousness, and that the roots of the modern conception of consciousness reside in Greek metaphysics.
- The author presents a new argument that the instantiation of universals is required by our conception of experience as a self-sustaining reality, but notes that this does not imply the existence of universals or vindicate realism, as our positive conception of experience is a misrepresentation derived from the objective world.
- The author discusses the ontological status of the objective, physical world, and how it relates to representation, marking the end of the development of the metaphysic in this book, and sets the stage for further development in a sequel, Gods and Titans, which will incorporate concepts such as free will, personal identity, and truth.

## Conclusion and Future Directions
- The final chapter of the book is seen as transitional, as it begins to explore the theme of philosophical and scientific understanding in the midst of technological advance, and the author's main concern is to show how their position establishes the relative autonomy of philosophy, with the sequel promising to further develop the metaphysic and explore new ideas, including the work of philosophers such as Dōgen and Nietzsche, and the concepts of consciousness, time, and universals.
- The author argues that science is limited in its ability to solve philosophical problems because its primary role is to describe the objective world, whereas philosophy is concerned with the status of the objective world within the context of transcendence, and therefore, philosophy will continue to oscillate between affirmations and denials of transcendence.
- The author believes that religious believers have seen something important, despite being wrong to think that the transcendent context is one of meaning, and that philosophy has a unique role to play in providing a rational way of thinking about these matters as our social framework advances.
- The author expresses gratitude to the ten philosophers who commented on their work, particularly thanking the editor, Masahiro Morioka, for setting up the journal, and notes that this symposium provides an ideal forum for responding to critical responses to their work.

## Responses to Critics
- The author responds to a review by Stephen Leach, who criticizes the author's dismissal of the possibility of a meaning of life as "idle", arguing that we have no way of knowing whether or not life is meaningless, and that our fear of disappointment at death is at the root of the absurdity of life, but the author counters that this fear is actually a fear of death itself, rather than a fear of disappointment.
- The author engages with Leach's idea that life is absurd because we fear disappointment at death, but will never experience it, and argues that this phenomenon is not about incoherently fearing a disappointment we will never feel, but rather about fearing the finality of death, and that this fear permeates our social lives and renders them absurd.
- The author's work is subject to various criticisms and responses, including those from Leach, Hawkins, and Bennett-Hunter, and the author sees this symposium as an opportunity to reflect on and develop their work in response to these criticisms, and to provide a rational way of thinking about the meaning of life and the role of philosophy in understanding transcendence.
- The author discusses the concept of nihilism and its relationship to the possibility of an afterlife, arguing that it is not inherently absurd to hope for something that is considered overwhelmingly unlikely, and that maintaining a positive attitude to life is rational as long as it is grounded in a reasonable assessment of the facts.
- The author critiques Leach's view that people should expect the worst, which is seen as a form of pessimism that can be just as absurd as optimism if not grounded in a reasonable assessment of the facts, and notes that irrational pessimism can generate unnecessary miserableness, whereas disappointment can be a spur to try again.
- The author responds to Leach's criticism that their nihilism is unjustified due to the unknown nature of what happens at death, by arguing that the question of what will happen to consciousness at death is illegitimate because it misrepresents consciousness as something objective, and that within the misrepresentation of consciousness as temporally ordered states, there is no reason to think that states of consciousness are correlated with dead bodies or can float free of the objective world.
- The author also responds to Leach's second criticism, which is that the connection between boredom and nihilism is unwarranted, by arguing that boredom can be a window onto nihilism, allowing individuals to become aware of the truth of nihilism, and that while it is possible that belief in nihilism is a product of boredom, the author's reasoning determines whether their idiosyncratic entry point to philosophy is a false start or a lucky break.
- The author notes that Leach's criticism may be influenced by the author's susceptibility to boredom, but argues that this is not relevant to the validity of their philosophical arguments, and that boredom can have uses within the social framework, but can also be a catalyst for exploring deeper philosophical truths.
- The concept of boredom is discussed in relation to framework engagement, where it can be a hindrance or a spur to re-evaluate goals, and it is argued that even when bored, goals can still grip individuals in a special, boring way, leading to a mistaken conclusion that they do not grip at all.
- The author suggests that boredom can provide an affinity to nihilism, allowing individuals to realize that their goals are a product of ordinary immersion, rather than the meaning of life, and that this special immersion will never generate its own goals.
- The author responds to a criticism from Stephen B. Hawkins, who calls them a "disappointed physicalist", by arguing that they simply abandoned physicalism due to finding reasons to do so, and that being a disappointed physicalist would imply wanting physicalism to be true for reasons such as human dignity or the prestige of science.
- The author identifies two possible reasons why someone might want physicalism to be true: firstly, to tell the final, definitive story about reality by means of physical science, which could be related to human dignity or the prestige of science, and secondly, due to anti-philosophical sentiment, where physicalism is seen as a way to put an end to philosophical debates about the nature of reality.
- The author argues that if someone wants physicalism to be true for either of these reasons, they will not be open to the truth or falsity of physicalism, but rather driven by pride in scientific achievement or disdain for philosophy, making it unlikely for them to be persuaded by arguments against physicalism unless they come from science itself.
- The author of the text describes themselves as an ex-physicalist who finds it difficult to imagine wanting a metaphysic to be true unless it is of a religious kind that holds something positive in store for humanity, and believes that most physicalists in academic philosophy today share this view.
- The author's Transcendent Hypothesis is seen by Hawkins as a case of settling for second-best, as the author could not have the physicalist metaphysic they wanted, and instead worked up a variety of Kantian idealism shaped by the skepticism of Hume, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, and some strands of Chinese philosophy.
- The author's approach to philosophy is to stay on the right side of both scientific and everyday understandings of the world, and to place the scientific picture within a wider philosophical perspective without challenging science or removing us from our common-sense understanding of the world.
- Hawkins disapproves of the author's approach, thinking that it hides philosophy away in a corner where it only transforms one's attitude and does not make a difference in the real world, and instead believes that philosophy should demand ever deeper understanding and make a difference in a world where real people govern themselves by what really matters.
- The author finds Hawkins' reading of their philosophy to be both intriguing and disconcerting, but is sure that it is not sustainable, and argues that their view that objective thought must be placed within the context of a transcendent reality is not timid or browbeaten, but rather a necessary recognition of the limitations of human understanding.
- The author affirms the status quo in two ways: by not disputing what science tells us about the world, and by not disputing what our everyday framework understanding tells us about what life basically amounts to, but also argues that reality is meaningless and transcendent, and builds this argument upon philosophical considerations about consciousness, which is a more philosophically significant sense in which they are not affirming the status quo.
- The author of the document 'Nihilism_Meaning' is responding to a criticism made by Hawkins, who argues that the author's demand for a deeper understanding of reality is not sufficient and that philosophy can provide a better and more substantive interpretation of reality.
- Hawkins' criticism is based on the idea that the author assumes objective thought is the only substantive interpretation of reality, and that this assumption is uncritical and dogmatic, as it does not consider the possibility of alternative explanations that could overturn objective thought.
- The author identifies two main reasons why someone would want to overturn objective thought: to make sense of consciousness or other features of reality that resist incorporation into the objective world, and to make room for a competing form of description that affirms a particular meaning of life and provokes personal or social action.
- The author argues that their account of consciousness as transcendent explains away the first reason for wanting to overturn objective thought, and that their argument that life is meaningless removes the second reason, as it suggests that the ultimate nature of human life does not provide any clues about what we should be doing with ourselves.
- The author also responds to a review by Guy Bennett-Hunter, which is a prime example of the bifurcation of critical response, where the reviewer likes the idea of transcendence but not the nihilism, highlighting the mixed reactions to the author's ideas.
- The author's position is that their account of consciousness and the meaninglessness of life removes any compelling reason for wanting to replace or seriously question the legitimacy of objective thought, and that everyday objective thought, extended through science, provides a sufficient understanding of the world.
- The central criticism of the review is that the author fails to refute the best argument for the claim that there is a meaning of life, which is the argument that if nihilism were true, people would not be able to carry on with their lives, and since most people do carry on, there must be a meaning of life.
- The author argues that this criticism is based on the idea that motivation requires a psychological spur, which is the belief in a meaning of life, but this idea is not relevant to the objection, as the objection claims that motivation is impossible without a meaning of life, regardless of whether one believes in it or not.
- Benne-Hunter, the critic, believes that there is both a logical and a psychological need to suppose that life has meaning and nihilism is false, but the author argues that only the logical need is relevant to the objection, and that the psychological need is not a necessary condition for motivation.
- The author also argues that Benne-Hunter's view is unstable and implausible, as it requires knowing something about transcendent reality that would rule out motivation, but if reality is objective, we already know that nihilism and motivation can coexist, and if it is transcendent, we cannot know anything about it that would rule out motivation.
- Furthermore, the author points out that Benne-Hunter's own work argues that reality is both transcendent and ineffable, which means that we cannot say what is or is not possible for it, and therefore, Benne-Hunter should not be claiming that meaninglessness is impossible for transcendent reality.
- The author concludes that Benne-Hunter's criticism is based on a flawed understanding of the relationship between motivation and the meaning of life, and that the author's own position on nihilism remains unchanged, as the criticism fails to provide a convincing argument against it.
- The text argues that transcendent reality is not necessary to explain human motivation, as objective thought provides a sufficient explanation.
- Human beings are naturally motivated by desires that help them survive and find satisfaction, which is a straightforward explanation for motivation.
- The author addresses criticism for allegedly discouraging philosophical thought, clarifying that while one can contemplate nihilism extensively, eventually, natural motivation will prevail if one is psychologically healthy.
- The author suggests that endorsing nihilism as a non-evaluative position does not mean one should resist natural motivations, as nihilism does not oppose being motivated by ordinary goals.
- The text critiques Bennett-Hunter for possibly misunderstanding nihilism as an evaluative and negative stance, suggesting that his reluctance to accept nihilism might stem from a desire to avoid it.
- The author references a concern, associated with David Cooper's views, that without belief in a meaning of life, people's commitment to goals might diminish, but argues that this overestimates the role of philosophy in sustaining motivation.
- The author contends that commitment to goals can persist without philosophical justification and addresses this concern in detail in chapter two of the book.
- The author responds to Bennett-Hunter's complaint about the lack of connection between nihilism and transcendence in the text, asserting that the connection is central to the work and is used to explain philosophical debates on consciousness, time, and universals.
- The text emphasizes the distinctive value of philosophy in explaining opposition to nihilism and transcendence.
- The provided text section from the document 'Nihilism_Meaning' discusses the concept of describing and explaining transcendent reality, with the idea that philosophy begins in wonder, and the author is willing to describe and explain apparently ineffable experiences.
