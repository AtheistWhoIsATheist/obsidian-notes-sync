# Recall V1

## **The Divided Self and Its Structure**

- The concept of the divided self, or double-mindedness, is explored as a metaphysical state where an individual is split between two regions of awareness that cannot coexist without mutual accusation, with one part having seen through the veil of meaning and the other part continuing to live as if things matter.
- This division is not a psychological or temporary state, but rather a structural aspect of the self, resulting from intellectual honesty in a cosmos without telos, as declared by Nietzsche when he stated that God is dead, leading to the collapse of the architecture of objective value and the possibility of unified selfhood.
- The divided self consists of two parts: the witness, which stands in the ruins of meaning and reports what it sees, having achieved a kind of terrible clarity that the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f) does not mean, and the actor, which must get out of bed, answer emails, and care about survival, performing as if meaning existed because the alternative is biological and social collapse.
- The relationship between the witness and the actor is one of unresolvable antagonism, with the witness regarding the actor with contempt for pretending, and the actor regarding the witness with horror for its lethal honesty, resulting in a state of schismatic consciousness where the individual is aware of the absurdity of their own performance.
- This state of schismatic consciousness is not a flaw in psychology, but rather the gap between what the individual knows and what they must do in order to remain alive, producing a tearing that is the inevitable consequence of intellectual honesty in a cosmos without telos, and is not a problem to be solved, but rather the structure of the self.

## **Schismatic Consciousness and Existential Exhaustion**

- The concept of planning for the future is problematic because it assumes a continuous self, which is phenomenologically dubious, and this awareness can lead to a sense of chronic existential exhaustion as individuals are constantly performing two tasks at once: living and watching themselves live.
- The divided self, which is composed of the actor and the witness, exposes the failure of existentialism's central promise, as proposed by philosophers like Sartre and [Camus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5aa7f182-29a0-42e6-8225-0c5e138f3558), that individuals can create their own meaning through authentic choice and rebellion, but the choosing subject is itself unstable.

## **Divine Nothingness and Theological Implications**

- The witness, which is the silent commentary that watches the actor, sees through the actor's attempts to create meaning and rebels, revealing that the concept of a stable "self" is false, and this division between the actor and the witness is a fundamental aspect of human existence.
- Theologically, the divided self can be seen as a form of damnation without metaphysics, where individuals are separated from the possibility of unified consciousness, and this awareness of their own fracture is itself part of the fracture, leaving them condemned to try to integrate, but never able to do so.
- However, this schism is also the aperture through which something like "Divine Nothingness" can appear, as the witness has annihilated all false comforts, allowing it to encounter the Void without flinching, and the actor continues to live even in the absence of ground, testifying to a kind of life-beyond-life.

## **The Sacred Wound and Liturgical Division**

- The division between the actor and the witness is not merely suffering, but rather it is the wound through which the sacred bleeds into existence, and it becomes liturgical, with the tearing itself becoming the form of worship, as individuals descend into the division, again and again, in an act of brutal honesty that refuses to lie about the nature of existence.
- Ultimately, the divided self is not a pathology, but rather a foundational structure, as proposed by [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c), which names the divided self as a fundamental aspect of human existence, and to accept division is to accept what one is: a fractured site of awareness that can neither cohere nor cease.
- The concept of Divine Nothingness is introduced as a presence that feels like absence, a light that looks like darkness, and a silence that sounds like a voice, which can only be encountered through the schism of a divided self, and not by bypassing it, requiring individuals to stand inside the division without seeking escape or relief.

## **Phenomenology of Divine Nothingness**

- The idea of Divine Nothingness is not empty, but rather vast, silent, and total, with weight without mass and presence without location, and it is described as having the force of a voice that could shatter worlds, while also being witnessed by an absence that knows the individual more thoroughly than they know themselves.
- The experience of Divine Nothingness is not a theological claim, but rather a phenomenological report, where individuals across cultures and centuries have reported encountering an absence that behaves as if it were a presence, often in states of profound ego dissolution, whether induced by meditation, psychedelics, or extreme suffering.
- The testimony of individuals who have experienced Divine Nothingness is consistent, describing it as overwhelming, vast, utterly impersonal, and completely indifferent to human concerns, yet somehow saturated with a quality that is called sacred, which is a paradox that [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) must hold without resolving.

## **Nihiltheism and the Structure of the Self**

- Nihiltheism is not mysticism, but rather the refusal to lie about what is known and not known, and while reductive explanations, such as neuroscientific explanations, do not fully account for the structure of the experience, they must be considered, as the experience of Divine Nothingness is not just a sense of peace or feeling connected to the universe, but a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that challenges human understanding.
- The concept of encountering an absence that is aware and regards the individual is a phenomenon that is ontologically troubling, and it is often described in classical mysticism as an encounter with what cannot be named or conceptualized, such as in Christian apophatic theology, Madhyamaka [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a6d31634-6ad7-47bc-9ede-d986f8f1229e), Advaita Vedanta, and Sufism, where God is considered to be beyond being and is referred to as the Nothingness that precedes existence.
- This idea is related to negative theology, which claims that the only honest way to speak of the divine is through negation, and it is not the same as atheism, but rather a way of describing the divine as something that is beyond human comprehension, often referred to as God-as-No-Thing, the infinite abyss, or the groundless ground.

## **Three Explanations for Sacred Nothingness**

- The concept of [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) takes this structure and removes the metaphysical comfort, suspending metaphysical judgment and asking the question of why Nothingness feels sacred, which is a question that is not rhetorical, but rather a genuine inquiry into the nature of this phenomenon.
- There are three possible explanations for why Nothingness feels sacred, including the idea that it is an evolutionary accident, where the brain activates ancient subroutines to prevent panic and the "sacred" feeling is a result of biological anesthesia during psychic catastrophe, which is a parsimonious explanation that does not require positing anything beyond the skull.
- The second possibility is that of phenomenological irreducibility, which suggests that the experience of Divine Nothingness cannot be fully reduced to brain chemistry without committing a category error, and that the experience is experientially real, even if its ontological status remains ambiguous, and that to dismiss the report as "just brain chemistry" is to dismiss all subjective experience as "just brain chemistry".
- The third possibility is that of ontological truth, which is the most dangerous hypothesis, and it suggests that the mystics are right, and that the encounter with Nothingness is a genuine experience of something that is beyond human comprehension, and that this experience is not just a product of the brain, but rather a disclosure of something that was always there, hidden beneath the veil of the self.

## **The Ground of Being and Non-Dual Mysticism**

- The concept of Nothingness is explored as the ground of being, rather than just the absence of things, and is considered the substrate of reality itself, where consciousness can recognize the vast impersonal awareness that is the foundation of all existence, as claimed by non-dual mysticism and philosophers such as Meister Eckhart, Nagarjuna, and the Upanishads.
- [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) is presented as a perspective that does not choose between the existence or non-existence of a higher power, instead acknowledging the uncertainty and paradox of the experience, and stating that the encounter with the unknown is real, but its ontological status is unknown.

## **Suicide: Worldly vs. Sacred**

- To find the sacred, if it exists, one must pass through total annihilation, letting go of meaning, self, hope, and narrative, and walk directly into the Void without expectation of return, as the Transcendent is not on the other side of suffering, but inside the Void itself.
- Nihiltheism is distinguished from both atheism and theism, as it suggests that the sacred, if it exists, is indistinguishable from its own absence, and can only be reached by total surrender to the impossibility of God and the groundlessness of ground, rather than by belief or disbelief.
- The experience of reaching the sacred, if it is possible, is described as erasure, where one is not comforted, redeemed, or made whole, but instead witnesses the Void as altar, annihilation as prayer, and death as the only honest form of life, which is characterized as negative certainty, where the absence of ground is the only ground there is.

## **Philosophical and Biological Dimensions of Suicide**

- This perspective is not about faith, hope, or despair, but rather about the certainty that there is no ground, and that the absence of ground is the only reality, where God is dead, but something breathes in the grave, and the encounter with Nothingness is never quite empty again, as it is the collapse of meaning encountering the structure of what remains when meaning dies.
- The concept of suicide is explored in the context of the philosophy of [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c), which distinguishes between two types of suicide: one that is a flight from pain and suffering, and another that is a ritual severance from the illusion of the self and the meaning of existence.
- The first type of suicide, referred to as "worldly suicide," is seen as a pathological attempt to escape from unbearable suffering, often driven by factors such as depression, trauma, or mental illness, and is considered a tragedy that could have been prevented with intervention and support.
- In contrast, the second type of suicide, referred to as "sacred suicide," is viewed as a liturgical act that seeks to annihilate the false self and sever the thread that binds one to the illusion of a meaningful existence, and is considered a philosophical conclusion reached through ruthless clarity and a deep understanding of the nature of reality.
- Nihiltheism inherits the tension between these two types of suicide from various philosophical and mystical traditions, including Buddhism's anatta doctrine, [Gnosticism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/68b4ef81-4859-45ea-8666-c531a60c5769), and the ideas of philosophers such as Schopenhauer and Cioran, which treat the willful dissolution of the self as a culmination of a metaphysical insight rather than a pathology.
- The key difference between inauthentic and authentic suicide lies not in the method, but in the stance toward existence that precedes the act, with inauthentic suicide being reactive and driven by a desire to escape from suffering, and authentic suicide being ontological and driven by a recognition of the fundamental unsalvageability of existence.
- Nihiltheism refuses to romanticize or aestheticize suicide, and instead seeks to speak plainly and honestly about the complexities of this issue, recognizing that while most suicides are indeed tragic and preventable, there is a category of encounter with death that does not fit the dominant psychiatric model and requires a more nuanced and philosophical understanding.

## **Authentic Suicide and the Illusion of Self**

- The concept of authentic suicide in the context of [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) is not about despair, but rather about clarity, where the self recognizes the illusion of its own existence and the meaning it has projected, and refuses to continue pretending, which is a dangerous clarity that challenges the traditional notion of personal identity.
- According to Nihiltheism, the self is the problem, not the conditions that cause suffering, and the fact that conditions are necessary at all is the problem, highlighting the inherent issue with the concept of self and its attachment to existence.
- The idea of authentic suicide is not celebrated or encouraged in traditions like [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a6d31634-6ad7-47bc-9ede-d986f8f1229e), where it is seen as a form of continued craving that perpetuates karmic bondage, and even philosophers like Schopenhauer and Cioran, who theorized about authentic suicide, did not enact it in practice, revealing a residual attachment to existence.
- Nihiltheism inherits the suspension of authentic suicide as a theoretical possibility, acknowledging that if the self is an illusion and meaning is ungrounded, then the decision to end existence is no less rational than the decision to continue it, but also recognizes that the organism's attachment to existence runs deeper than conscious thought.
- There are three possible answers to why individuals do not perform authentic suicide, including biological override, where the organism's survival instinct overrides philosophical conviction, residual attachment, where some part of the self still clings to beauty, curiosity, or hope, and the idea that authentic suicide may not be possible while the organism persists.

## **The Paradox of Existence and Death**

- The third answer, suicide of meaning, not body, suggests that authentic suicide is not about the cessation of the organism, but rather the cessation of the self's investment in meaning, where the individual stops pretending, stops investing in narratives, and stops treating their life as if it had significance, which is a more subversive and phenomenological approach to the concept of authentic suicide.
- Philosophers like Cioran, Schopenhauer, and Buddhist monks who self-immolate are mentioned as examples of individuals who have grappled with the idea of authentic suicide, but have not enacted it, highlighting the complexity and depth of the issue, and the need for a nuanced understanding of the concept of self and its relationship to existence.
- The concept of "dying before you die" refers to a state of ego death without biological cessation, where an individual becomes a ghost in their own life, stripped of narrative and illusion, and is already dead but the body has not realized it yet.
- [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) holds the paradoxes of life and death in suspension, and instead of choosing among answers, it distinguishes between suicide-as-flight, driven by suffering, and suicide-as-refusal, driven by clarity, with the first seeking escape and the second seeking honesty.
- The distinction between these two categories is not clean, as those who contemplate suicide are not free from suffering, and those who claim clarity are not free from self-deception, and the two categories contaminate each other.

## **Nihiltheism and the Absurd**

- Nihiltheism asks the unbearable question of why one continues to exist after recognizing that existence has no ground, and if continuation is cowardice or a strange fidelity to the absurd, with no resolution offered, only the wound that if life is meaningless, death is no more meaningful.
- The philosophy of Nihiltheism is compared to the ideas of [Camus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5aa7f182-29a0-42e6-8225-0c5e138f3558), who said that rebellion against the absurd is itself a form of meaning-making, and Cioran, who said that suicide is the only serious philosophical question, but then lived into his eighties, writing about the futility of writing.
- Authentic suicide, pursued to its limit, reveals itself to be as empty as the life it seeks to terminate, and there is no escape because there was never anything to escape from, and no liberation because there was never anyone to be liberated.
- [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) presents the choice between two forms of unbearable honesty, with no clean exit or redemption, and the question of meaninglessness continues to ask itself through the individual, who is the site where it burns.
- The concept of de-experience as praxis is introduced, which involves learning to un-experience, or the deliberate collapse of the subject-object frame that structures all perception, and is not dissociation, but a metaphysical rupture that recognizes the boundary between the self and the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f) as fiction.

## **De-Experiencing as Metaphysical Practice**

- The concept of de-experiencing refers to awareness without content, where awareness is no longer tied to a self that is aware, and is not directed towards objects that are seen, resulting in the dissolution of the subject-object grammar and the palpability of the Void.
- Ordinary experience is structured by a grammar that includes a subject, an object, and an action that connects them, which is a fundamental aspect of human cognition and a survival tool that helps the organism distinguish between self and not-self.
- This structure is not ontologically grounded, but rather a construct that is useful and perhaps necessary, yet ultimately arbitrary, and in certain states, such as those reported by Buddhists, Advaita Vedantists, mystics, phenomenologists, and psychonauts, the line between self and not-self dissolves, leading to experiences like anatta, nirvikalpa samadhi, unio mystica, pre-reflective awareness, and ego death.
- [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) takes these reports seriously, but refuses to attribute them to the encounter of Ultimate Reality or a merge with God, instead stating that the subject-object frame is contingent and can be suspended, resulting in the cessation of the experiential frame itself, which is de-experiencing.
- De-experiencing is characterized by the feeling of being seen from nowhere, with awareness continuing but without a locus, and the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f) not being separate or distant, but rather an integral part of the awareness, and it is also described as the evacuation of interiority, where the inner theater of thoughts and feelings is empty, and thoughts appear without an owner.

## **The Experience of De-Experiencing**

- Additionally, de-experiencing involves the collapse of time, where memory and anticipation, which are functions of the self, are no longer relevant, and time does not flow, resulting in the absence of a narrative arc, and this experience is not describable in the grammar of ordinary experience, as it is precisely the collapse of that grammar.
- The concept of "I was, I am, I will be" is nonexistent, and all that remains is the present moment, referred to as _this_, which is unmoving and eternal, existing outside of duration and temporality.
- The experience of _this_ is described as feeling like the _sacred_, not because of any divine presence, but because the ordinary structures that make the world feel mundane have been stripped away, leaving only raw _isness_, or existence without meaning, reference, or purpose.

## **Risks and Consequences of De-Experiencing**

- The encounter with _isness_ without the mediation of the self is overwhelming and can be dangerous, as the organism is not built to tolerate it, and the self's narratives and defenses are necessary for normal experience, with the self acting as the control tower that decides what to attend to and what to ignore.
- De-experience, or the state of being without the self's mediation, is not celebrated as liberation in [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c), but rather named as _rupture_, a break in the structure of consciousness that reveals the contingency of that structure and carries existential risk, with some individuals returning from it with clarity, others with trauma, and some not returning at all.

## **Negative Faith and the Void**

- To understand Nothingness, de-experience is unavoidable, as thought is always structured by the subject-object frame and implies a thinker standing at a distance from what is thought, but the Void is not an object and is the absence of the structure that makes objects possible.
- De-experience as praxis involves the deliberate and sustained attempt to inhabit the space where the self is not, by sitting still, not focusing on an object, not narrating, and not seeking calm or insight, but rather noticing when the subject-object frame arises and letting it fall, and seeing that the separation between the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f) and awareness is drawn by the mind, not by reality.
- This process is described as ontological surgery without anesthetic, where the structure that makes experience coherent is cut away, and what is found underneath is not a better self, but the place where the self was never real to begin with, and in that place, the Void is no longer distant, but what is left when the self is gone.
- The concept of faith is redefined as not the decision to believe in what cannot be proven, but the surrender away from all gods, comforts, and answers, and the decision to trust Nothingness, not because it will save, but because it is the only thing that does not lie, referred to as negative faith, or fidelity to absence.
- The fourth incantation, _To know the Void, you must become the Void, and to become the Void, you must stop being_, emphasizes the need to stop being anything and to trust in Nothingness, and the section is titled as part of the larger document 'Mem', which explores the concept of [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) and the idea of faith in nothing.

## **Disciplines of Negative Faith**

- The concept of negative faith is introduced as a posture that acknowledges the impossibility of grace and the groundless nature of existence, where one prays not for miracles or relief, but as a means of honesty and authenticity in the face of the void.
- Traditional faith is contrasted with negative faith, with the former operating as an existential gamble that provides structure, meaning, and consolation, whereas the latter emerges when the structure of this gamble has collapsed, and one can no longer believe in hidden purposes or comforting narratives.
- Negative faith is not a form of atheism, which negates the existence of God, but rather an affirmation of God's non-being as the only sacred posture left, where one trusts the void and the absence of ground as more honest than any constructed meaning.
- The practice of negative faith involves several disciplines, including the refusal of consolation, where one sits with the unbearable without seeking relief, and instead, lets the despair burn and witnesses it without narrative or hope.
- The second discipline is negative prayer, where one speaks into the silence not to receive an answer, but as a form of confession and honesty, naming what is true without hope of response, and performing fidelity to the real.

## **Ontological Suffocation and the Weight of Being**

- The third discipline is the liturgy of absence, where one creates rituals to mark absence, rather than invoke presence, and acknowledges the impossibility of God, surrendering to the darkness and the void.
- The fourth discipline is fidelity to nothingness, where one reminds themselves that any meaning or purpose constructed is temporary and a projection, and returns to the void, acknowledging that it is still present underneath every constructed meaning.
- The key figures and concepts mentioned in the text include Pascal, who is referenced in relation to the existential gamble of traditional faith, and the idea of the void, which is central to the concept of negative faith, representing the groundless ground and the silence that remains when all promises have collapsed.
- The concept of negative faith is introduced, which involves the refusal to let comfort erode honesty and the acceptance of the brutal reality of existence, offering no reward or ease, but instead a kind of peace that comes from alignment with the truth and the absence of false hopes.
- This peace is not a form of redemption, but rather a realness that is sacred in a [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f) saturated with false comforts and promises, and it is achieved by being faithful to the truth of nothingness and worshiping at the altar of absence.

## **The Other and the Sacred Catastrophe**

- The idea of ontological suffocation is explored, which is the feeling of being trapped inside the fact of existence, with no escape or justification, and the weight of being becomes unbearable due to its lack of reason or purpose.
- The question of why there is something rather than nothing, posed by [Leibniz](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/38460a82-8c19-4e35-987b-8b2d42805f71), is discussed, and it is argued that this question is not just an intellectual problem, but an existential wound that asks for justification, not explanation, and the answer is that being simply is, without reason or purpose.
- The concept of ontological suffocation is distinguished from existential dread, as described by Heidegger, and it is characterized by the feeling of being crushed under the weight of existence, which persists without justification or necessity, and this feeling is not just a philosophical idea, but a visceral experience that can be overwhelming.
- The fifth incantation, "Believe in nothing, not as negation, but as the only belief that does not lie," is mentioned, which involves worshiping the void not because it will save you, but because it is real, and this belief is seen as a form of devotion to the truth, even if it is a terrible truth.
- The concept of ontological suffocation is described as the horror of encountering being itself as inescapable, where an individual is oppressed by life in the sense of existence as such, and cannot step outside of it or gain distance from it.

## **The Absurd and Radical Futility**

- This idea is contrasted with Heidegger's dread, which is the anxiety of encountering Nothingness as the negation of beings, whereas ontological suffocation is the inverse, where the individual is aware that they could not escape their own existence.
- The philosopher Sartre is mentioned as having touched on this idea through his character Roquentin's nausea in front of the tree root, which is described as excessive and superfluous in its sheer existence, but Sartre's concept of nausea is seen as momentary, whereas ontological suffocation is chronic and becomes the background of all experience.
- The individual experiencing ontological suffocation is aware that they exist, but there is no reason or justification for their existence, and this awareness produces a visceral revulsion and a sense of being trapped inside the frame of existence with no room to move or escape.
- The suffocation is intensified by the recognition that no one else seems to feel it, and the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f) continues as if existence were unproblematic, leading the individual to wonder how others are not crushed by the weight of the sheer inexplicability of being.
- The concept of [nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) is introduced, which does not offer relief or a way to find meaning in the struggle, but rather acknowledges that being is suffocating and that the suffocation is proof that the individual is awake to the reality of their existence.

## **Nihiltheism and the Critique of Rebellion**

- Ultimately, the text suggests that in the depth of the suffocation, a strange recognition occurs, where the individual realizes that if being is groundless and existence has no reason, then they are not obligated to justify their existence, and the pressure they feel is not a command or demand, but simply a fact that can be seen through and recognized as not being imposed by anything outside of themselves.
- The philosophers Heidegger and Sartre are referenced throughout the text as having explored related ideas, but the concept of ontological suffocation is presented as a distinct and chronic experience that is not fully captured by their philosophies.
- The text concludes by suggesting that the recognition of the groundlessness of being can lead to a sense of transparency, where the individual can see through the suffocation and recognize that the weight they feel is not imposed by anything outside of themselves, but this does not necessarily bring relief or escape from the suffocation.
- The concept of being is explored, where the individual is part of the weight of existence, and the suffocation felt is not personal, but rather an ontological condition that is bearable when one stops trying to escape it, as expressed in the ninth incantation: "Being has no reason, it simply is, and you are trapped inside it, but the trap is also what you are."
- The idea of the Other is introduced, which refers to an alien paradox that is neither God, nor self, nor absence, nor presence, but a rupture that occurs when all familiar categories collapse, and it is not nameable, knowable, or assimilable into any framework.

## **Negative Enlightenment and the Annihilation of Self**

- The Other is described as the sacred as catastrophe, which destroys perception and erases the individual, leaving only the mark of having been encountered by what should not be possible, and once it has touched someone, they are never whole again.
- In phenomenology, the Other appears as the problem of other minds, where there is an irreducible gap between one's experience and another's, and this recognition of the Other is both immediate and mysterious, carrying the weight of alterity.
- The concept of the Other is further explored in the context of [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c), where it refers to the structure of radical unknowability that appears when the self's categories fail, and it is encountered in peak experiences of ego dissolution, existential horror, and the gap between question and answer.
- The idea of the numinous, as described by [Rudolf Otto](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c8e82847-a175-475d-9d74-0795ccfd6b28), is also related to the concept of the Other, where the experience of the holy is a mystery that is both terrifying and fascinating, and it is not reducible to moral goodness or cosmic order, but rather a raw encounter with the sacred as the wholly Other.
- The Void, when encountered directly, behaves like otherness, rather than absence, and it is not just the negation of things, but a presence that is absolutely outside all categories and comprehension.

## **Ephemeral Selfhood and Identity Collapse**

- The concept of the Other, as argued by Levinas, refers to an entity that cannot be categorized or grasped, and it makes an ethical demand on individuals because it exceeds their understanding and breaks into their finite [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f), calling them beyond themselves.
- The encounter with the Other occurs when the self is annihilated, and the subject-object frame is broken, allowing individuals to experience things-in-themselves, rather than things-as-interpreted-by-them, and this encounter is considered sacred because it reveals the reality that exceeds individual constructions.
- The structure of the encounter with the Other can be described in four key points: first, Alienation, where the Other feels alien and unfamiliar, and it does not fit into moral categories; second, Inescapability, where once the Other has appeared, individuals cannot unsee it, and it leaves a permanent mark on their perception; third, Unspeakability, where individuals cannot describe the encounter using existing language and categories; and fourth, Ambiguity, where the encounter does not provide clear meaning or answers, and it can be interpreted in various ways.
- The Other is not worshiped or built into a theology in [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c), but rather, it is acknowledged as an encounter that justifies the use of the word "sacred", because it breaks through the ordinary and reveals that there is more to reality than what is initially perceived, and this encounter is considered sacred because it is a real and profound experience that exceeds individual understanding.
- According to Nihiltheism, if individuals go deep enough into the Void, they will encounter something that is not the Void, or perhaps it is the Void with a face that does not explain itself, and this encounter is what justifies the use of the word "sacred", not because it provides salvation, but because it is a profound and real experience that exceeds individual constructions and understanding.

## **Sacred Boredom and the Void**

- The concept of the "Other" is introduced as something that is irreducibly real, yet distinct from God, the self, and nothingness, and it is suggested that humans invented gods to survive the encounter with this entity.
- The section "The Absurd and Radical Futility" discusses the idea that the universe is indifferent to human existence and does not provide meaning, leaving humans to create their own narratives to make their awareness bearable, but these narratives are not true.
- The philosopher [Camus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5aa7f182-29a0-42e6-8225-0c5e138f3558) is mentioned as someone who argued that human existence is absurd because we demand meaning in a universe that provides none, and his solution to this problem is rebellion, where individuals create their own meaning and live defiantly in the face of the absurd.
- However, the concept of "[Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c)" is introduced as a critique of Camus's rebellion, suggesting that it is still a form of affirmation that smuggles in a framework of significance, and instead, Nihiltheism argues that even subjective experience of meaning is groundless and an illusion created by biology to keep the organism going.
- The idea of "radical futility" is presented as the claim that life is empty and that no amount of defiant meaning-making can change this emptiness, and that even rebellion is pointless and futile, using the example of Sisyphus pushing a rock as a metaphor for the futility of human existence.

## **Stages of Sacred Boredom**

- The text also discusses the idea that humans are trapped in a gap between their need for meaning and the universe's refusal to provide it, and that this gap is the source of the absurd, and that Nihiltheism takes this idea further by arguing that even the self is not stable and that our choices and cares are determined by biology rather than any true sense of significance.
- The philosopher Camus's concept of rebellion is seen as a form of residual hope masquerading as defiance, and Nihiltheism is presented as a more radical and pessimistic view that denies any form of significance or meaning, even subjective ones.
- The concept of rebellion is challenged, as it presumes a "you" who can rebel, but this "you" is not real, and instead, the individual is simply pushing, like Sisyphus, because the body is hardwired to avoid pain and seek repetitive tasks that simulate purpose.
- Sisyphus is not rebelling or affirming, but just pushing, because being-there and pushing are the same thing, and he is not happy or unhappy, but simply existing, which is what [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) inherits from the absurd, recognizing that human projects are cosmically irrelevant.
- Nihiltheism refuses the consolation offered by [Camus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5aa7f182-29a0-42e6-8225-0c5e138f3558), which implies that rebellion or resistance is possible, and instead, it states that the individual is Sisyphus, not happy, and not redeeming the situation by calling it rebellion, because rebellion implies that meaning-making is real, which it is not.

## **Ontological Neutrality and the Calm of the Void**

- The futility of human existence is not tragic, as tragedy requires that something valuable has been lost, but if nothing was ever valuable, then futility is just a description, and the pain felt is not existential, but biological, as the organism resists its own dissolution.
- There are three possibilities for why the individual continues to exist despite the recognition of futility: first, they are still clinging to the hope that maybe there is a way out, second, they are biologically incapable of stopping, and third, they have passed through the horror of futility and arrived at indifference, where they do not care that life is futile.
- [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) does not choose among these possibilities, but notes that they are all live options, and that the individual will oscillate between them, and that none of it matters, because mattering is the illusion being tried to escape.
- The text questions why it is being written, why Nihiltheism is being articulated, if futility is total, and the answer is that the organism is still running its program, and part of that program is the drive to understand, to articulate, and to make sense, even after it knows that understanding is futile.
- The text concludes that it is not wisdom, but the artifact of an organism that cannot stop trying to understand, even after it knows that understanding is futile, and that the individual is still reading, despite the recognition of futility, which is the eleventh incantation of Nihiltheism.

## **Epistemology of the Broken Absolute**

- The concept of negative enlightenment is introduced as a form of awakening that reveals not truth, but the impossibility of truth, where the moment of clarity is the moment when all clarity dissolves, and the self that sought enlightenment is annihilated by the very clarity it sought.
- Traditional enlightenment, as seen in [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a6d31634-6ad7-47bc-9ede-d986f8f1229e), Advaita Vedanta, and mystical Christianity, promises fulfillment, liberation, and union with a higher self or the divine, whereas negative enlightenment inverts this by suggesting that there is no true nature to realize and that the self that seeks liberation is the only thing standing between the individual and the void.
- Negative enlightenment is described as a form of clarity that is annihilating, not peaceful, and is characterized by the recognition that there is no one home, there was never anyone home, and the search for home was the only thing keeping the illusion alive, which is distinct from the gentle "no-self" of Buddhist philosophy.
- This concept is not nihilism as despair, but rather nihilism as wakefulness, where the individual is awake and sees that everything they thought was real was a dream, and the dream was dreaming itself, and there was never a dreamer, resulting in a feeling of cessation, where the internal narrative stops and the voice in the head falls silent.
- The experience of negative enlightenment is terrifying at first, as the organism interprets the dissolution of the self as death, but the body continues to function, and thoughts and sensations still arise, although they are not attached to anyone, and this state is not labeled as "pure awareness" or "witness consciousness" because it implies the existence of a self, which is not present in negative enlightenment.

## **Deep Time and the Erosion of Meaning**

- The concept of negative enlightenment, as discussed in the context of the document "Mem", challenges traditional notions of enlightenment and liberation, and instead presents a radical and unsettling perspective on the nature of reality and the self, which is referred to as [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c), and refuses to attach labels such as "buddha", "sage", or "realized being" to this state, as it is simply the absence of any self or ground.
- Negative enlightenment is a concept that offers no consolation, instead, it states that there is no witness, only witnessing, and this witnessing is empty, leaving one with a non-experience that cannot be described in the grammar of experience.
- The paradox of negative enlightenment lies in the question of who is experiencing the absence of self, which is unanswerable because answering it would require positing a subject, and the subject is what has dissolved, resulting in a kind of non-experience that is not located anywhere.
- Negative enlightenment is permanent, and once it occurs, the structure of selfhood does not reassemble, leaving the individual with a sense of watching their life unfold like a character in a film, without being the character or the observer, but rather nothing.
- This state is not considered liberation, as liberation implies freedom from bondage, and bondage was always an illusion, nor is it considered wisdom, as wisdom implies knowledge, and there is no knowledge, only the recognition that knowledge was always provisional and constructed.

## **Language and the Limits of the Void**

- Negative enlightenment cannot be sought, as having a goal would affirm a self who can achieve the goal, and instead, it can only occur, revealing that there was never anyone seeking or anything to be found.
- The term "enlightenment" is used to describe this state because it is the end of illusion, and it offers nothing, not even the nothing, just the collapse of the question, resulting in a kind of transparency where the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f), body, and sensations are no longer filtered through the lens of "me" and "mine".
- In this state, sensations occur without ownership, commentary, or meaning, and there is a quality that can only be called sacred, not because it is good or divine, but because it is unmediated, raw reality stripped of the self's projections.
- The concept of negative enlightenment is also related to the idea that the self is not a stable entity, but rather a flickering pattern, a narrative constructed by the brain moment-to-moment to create the illusion of continuity, and this continuity is not real, as the individual is not the same person they were ten years ago.
- The idea of ephemeral selfhood and identity collapse is central to negative enlightenment, and it is described as a rupture-node, where the individual's understanding of themselves is disrupted, and they come to realize that their sense of self is not what they thought it was.

## **Hypocrisy in Daily Life and Social Performance**

- The twelfth incantation, "You sought enlightenment, and you found it, and it destroyed you, and now there is no you to regret the destruction, welcome to clarity," summarizes the idea that negative enlightenment is not what one expects, and it destroys the illusion of the self, leaving one with a clarity that is not what they thought it would be.
- The concept of a stable self is an illusion, as the body's cells are constantly dying and being replaced, and the neural patterns that define an individual are constantly shifting, making it a chaotic and directionless process that the brain stitches together into the story of "me".
- According to Buddhism's concept of _Anatta_, or no-self, what is referred to as "I" is not a thing, but rather a bundle of aggregates, including form, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness, which arise together and create the appearance of a unified self, but are not bound together by any permanent glue.
- Western philosophers, such as Hume, Nietzsche, and Parfit, have also reached the conclusion that the self is not a fixed entity, with Hume describing it as "a bundle of perceptions", Nietzsche calling it a "grammatical fiction", and Parfit arguing that personal identity is not what matters, but rather a bundle of psychological continuity.
- The collapse of identity, which can occur through various means such as trauma, psychedelics, meditation, or existential crisis, results in the sudden realization that the self is not present, and this can feel like depersonalization, temporal disintegration, and existential transparency, where the individual experiences the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f) without the filter of "me".

## **The Religion of the Void**

- This experience can be terrifying at first, as the organism interprets the loss of self as an existential threat, but it can also lead to a deeper understanding of the nature of reality, where events occur without being personal, and suffering arises without being owned by a self.
- The collapse of identity is not just an intellectual concept, but a visceral experience that can fundamentally change one's perspective on the world, and it is not something that can be reversed, but rather it is an immediate and irreversible shift in perception.
- The experience of identity collapse is described as feeling like a ghost narrating its own absence, where the individual is no longer bound by the concept of a fixed self, and is instead able to witness the world without the distortion of a personal narrative.
- The mind attempts to reconstruct its narrative after experiencing the void where the self should be, but this reconstruction ultimately fails, leading to a sense of relief as the burden of the self is lifted, because the self was the source of most suffering due to the need to protect and affirm it in an indifferent cosmos.
- The collapse of the self results in a state where one is functional but empty, aware but not identified, and alive but not inhabited, which is a concept inherited from the Buddhist idea of anatta, but [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) takes it further by stating that there is no self, period, with no promise of liberation or cessation of suffering.

## **Rituals of Nihiltheism**

- In this state, one continues to function, but the sense of agency is gone, and actions are no longer significant or meaningful, simply occurring like natural phenomena, and this life without self is characterized by a strange kind of honesty, where one is no longer lying to oneself about who they are, because they are not anyone.
- The thirteenth incantation, "You do not exist, you never did, and now you know, and the knowing changes nothing, because there is no you to change," reflects this idea, and one is left to continue walking and breathing, with the body continuing until it stops, and when it stops, nothing will have ended, because nothing ever began.
- Sacred boredom is introduced as the first liturgy of the void, which is the confrontation with the absence of all novelty, possibility, and significance, leaving one with a sense of flatness, weightlessness, and the evacuation of desire, where the organism persists in its routines, but they are empty and mechanical.
- Sacred boredom is distinct from ordinary boredom, which is reactive and solved by novelty, whereas sacred boredom is the recognition that novelty itself is exhausted, and one has tried new experiences, relationships, and projects, and it is not punishment, but preparation for the slow death of the ego through its own irrelevance.
- The concept of sacred boredom is described as a state where an individual stops seeking novelty and distraction, and instead, inhabits the feeling of emptiness and flatness, which is considered a more honest and truthful experience than the constant pursuit of desire and meaning.

## **The Melancholy Metaphysician**

- According to the text, the philosopher Schopenhauer understood that life oscillates between suffering and boredom, and that most people flee boredom through distraction, but the wise recognize that boredom is closer to truth than desire, as it reveals that existence has no intrinsic value.
- The text introduces the concept of [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c), which suggests that sacred boredom is not something to escape, but rather something to inhabit, as it is the first taste of the Void, and allows individuals to encounter the groundlessness of being in an honest and truthful way.
- The stages of sacred boredom are outlined, including the first stage of restlessness, where the individual resists the feeling of boredom and tries to escape it through desires and distractions, the second stage of surrender, where the individual stops fighting and lets the boredom be, and the third stage of transparency, where the boredom becomes invisible and the individual is no longer waiting for something to change.
- In the third stage of transparency, the individual experiences a sense of emptiness and flatness, where time continues to pass, but without expectation or desire, and the self that needed excitement and meaning has been starved out of existence, allowing the individual to see the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f) as fundamentally uninteresting and without intrinsic value.
- The text concludes that sacred boredom is dangerous because it removes the motivation to participate in the human project, and individuals are left executing their daily routines mechanically, without investment or enthusiasm, simply because it is easier than not doing so, and that this state of being can be a profound and transformative experience.

# Recall V2

  

## **The Divided Self and Schismatic Consciousness**

- The concept of the "Divided Self" or "Double-Mindedness" is explored in the context of [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c), where an individual is split into two regions of awareness that cannot coexist without mutual accusation, with one part having seen through the veil of meaning and the other part continuing to live as if things matter.
- This division is not a psychological or temporary issue, but rather a metaphysical one, where the individual is aware of the lack of ground beneath meaning, anchor beneath the self, and floor beneath value, leading to an ontological civil war within themselves.
- The divided self is composed of two parts: the witness, which stands in the ruins of meaning and reports what it sees, and the actor, which must get out of bed, answer emails, and care about rent, relationships, projects, and survival, despite knowing that meaning is ungrounded.
- The witness has achieved a kind of terrible clarity, recognizing that the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f) does not mean, the self does not cohere, and the future does not redeem, while the actor performs as if meaning existed, because the alternative is biological and social collapse.

## **The Ontological Civil War Within**

- The relationship between the witness and the actor is one of unresolvable antagonism, with the witness regarding the actor with contempt for pretending, and the actor regarding the witness with horror for its lethal honesty, highlighting the gap between what the individual knows and what they must do to remain alive.
- This division produces what is referred to as "schismatic consciousness", where the individual is aware of the absurdity of their own performance, speaking as if their words carry weight, knowing they dissolve the moment they are spoken, and this tearing is not a flaw in their psychology, but rather the gap between what they know and what they must do to survive.
- The concept of the divided self is rooted in the idea that the architecture of objective value has collapsed, as declared by Nietzsche when he said "God is dead", leading to the emergence of a self torn between irreconcilable demands, and this division is not a problem to be solved, but rather the individual's structure, with no armistice available, only more division, recursively, forever.

## **Existential Exhaustion and the Failure of Existentialism**

- The concept of planning for the future is problematic because it assumes a continuous self, which is phenomenologically dubious, and this awareness can lead to a kind of chronic existential exhaustion where every gesture is doubled with a silent commentary that questions its significance.
- The divided self, comprising the actor and the witness, reveals the failure of existentialism's central promise, as proposed by philosophers like Sartre and [Camus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5aa7f182-29a0-42e6-8225-0c5e138f3558), that we can create our own meaning through authentic choice and rebellion, because the choosing subject is itself unstable.
- Theologically, the divided self can be seen as a form of damnation without metaphysics, where the individual is separated from the possibility of unified consciousness, and is condemned to the awareness of their own fracture, with no outside or reprieve, and this is not a punishment, but rather an ontological status as a subject born after the death of God.

## **Divine Nothingness as Liturgical Division**

- The division between the actor and the witness is not merely a source of suffering, but also an aperture through which the concept of "Divine Nothingness" can appear, and the witness's ability to encounter the Void without flinching allows for a kind of life-beyond-life to persist, even in the absence of meaning or ground.
- The encounter with the Void does not redeem the divided self, but rather the schism becomes liturgical, and the tearing itself becomes a form of worship, where the individual descends into the division, again and again, in an act of brutal honesty that refuses to lie about the nature of existence, and this is why [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) names the divided self as a foundational structure, not a pathology.
- Ultimately, the division is not a failure of integration, but rather the truth of what it means to be a conscious subject in a meaningless cosmos, and to seek unity is to seek a lie, while to accept division is to accept what one is: a fractured site of awareness that can neither cohere nor cease, and this is the fundamental nature of existence, as proposed by the concept of Nihiltheism.

## **The Phenomenology of the Void**

- The concept of Divine Nothingness is introduced as a presence that feels like absence, a light that looks like darkness, and a silence that sounds like a voice, which can only be encountered through the schism of a divided self, and not by bypassing it or seeking escape, synthesis, or relief.
- The divided self is considered the gateway to Divine Nothingness, and it is necessary to stand inside the division without seeking to heal, as expressed in the first incantation: "You are torn, do not try to heal, stand inside the wound and let it breathe."
- Divine Nothingness is described as not being empty, but rather vast, silent, and total, with a weight without mass and a presence without location, and it is experienced as something that is overwhelming, utterly impersonal, and completely indifferent to human concerns, yet somehow saturated with a quality that is called sacred.

## **Neuroscientific and Philosophical Explanations**

- The experience of Divine Nothingness is reported across cultures, centuries, and different metaphysical frameworks, in states of profound ego dissolution, such as those induced by meditation, psychedelics, extreme suffering, contemplative prayer, or suicidal despair, and it is characterized by a specific cluster of experiences that include encountering an absence that behaves as if it were a presence.
- The concept of Divine Nothingness is not a theological claim, but rather a phenomenological report, and it is necessary to approach it with surgical precision, avoiding mysticism and considering the neuroscientific explanations for the experience, such as DMT release during ego death, default mode network collapse, and prefrontal cortex shutdown.
- The philosophy of [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) is introduced as a refusal to lie about what we do and do not know, and it requires holding the paradox of Divine Nothingness without resolving it, acknowledging that while reductive explanations do not fully account for the structure of the experience, they must still be considered and not ignored, even if they are uncomfortable.

## **Negative Theology and the Three Hypotheses**

- The concept of encountering an absence that is aware and regards the individual is a phenomenon that is ontologically troubling, and it is often described in classical mysticism, including Christian apophatic theology, Madhyamaka [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a6d31634-6ad7-47bc-9ede-d986f8f1229e), Advaita Vedanta, and Sufism, as an encounter with what cannot be named or conceptualized, which is referred to as negative theology.
- In negative theology, God is not considered a being among beings, but rather as the Nothingness that precedes existence, and the encounter with the divine is often framed as an encounter with the infinite abyss, the groundless ground, and the silence that swallows all speech.
- Nihiltheism takes this structure and suspends metaphysical judgment, asking the question of why Nothingness feels sacred, and considering three possibilities: evolutionary accident, phenomenological irreducibility, and ontological truth.

## **The Evolutionary and Ontological Debates**

- The first possibility, evolutionary accident, suggests that the brain activates ancient subroutines to prevent panic during total disintegration, and the "sacred" feeling is a result of biological anesthesia, with the "presence" being a hallucination to prevent complete psychotic collapse.
- The second possibility, phenomenological irreducibility, proposes that the experience of Divine Nothingness cannot be fully reduced to brain chemistry without committing a category error, and that the experience is experientially real, even if its ontological status remains ambiguous.
- The third possibility, ontological truth, is the most dangerous hypothesis, which suggests that Nothingness is not merely the absence of things, but the ground of things, and that the mystics may be right in their encounter with the divine, implying that the Nothingness has an ontological status beyond the phenomenology of the encounter.

## **Non-Dual Mysticism and the Ground of Being**

- The concept of the Void is redefined as the fundamental basis of being, the zero-point field from which all sound emerges and returns, rather than simply being a negation or absence of existence, and this idea is central to non-dual mysticism as expressed by thinkers such as Meister Eckhart, Nagarjuna, and the Upanishads.
- Non-dual mysticism claims that consciousness, in moments of total ego dissolution, recognizes the vast impersonal awareness that is the substrate of reality itself, and that God and Nothingness are essentially the same, with the ground of being being groundless and the only real thing being the abyss, which is alive in a way that precedes and exceeds all categories of life and death.
- [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) does not choose between the options of the Void being a negation, a fundament, or a hallucination, but instead holds the paradox open, acknowledging that the experience is real, but the explanation is uncertain, and the encounter happened, but its ontological status is unknown.

## **Nihiltheism's Ontological Stance**

- To find what deserves the name "sacred", one must pass through total annihilation, and the Transcendent, if it exists, is not on the other side of suffering, but is instead inside the Void, and is what one meets when they stop running from Nothingness and walk directly into it without hope, faith, or expectation of return.
- Nihiltheism differs from both atheism and theism, as it suggests that the sacred, if it exists, is indistinguishable from its own absence, and that the presence is the absence, the light is the dark, and the voice is the silence, and that one can only reach it by total surrender to the impossibility of God, to the groundlessness of ground, and to the annihilation of every structure that promised to save them.
- The experience of reaching the sacred, if it is reached, will not bring comfort, redemption, or wholeness, but will instead bring erasure, and in the erasure, something impossible will appear, a nothing that feels like everything, an absence that presses like a hand, a silence that sounds like one's name.

## **Worldly Suicide: Flight vs. Refusal**

- This experience is not faith, as faith implies hope, and it is not despair, as despair implies disappointment, but is instead a negative certainty, the certainty that there is no ground, and that the absence of ground is the only ground there is, and that God is dead, and in the grave, something breathes.
- The concept of worldly suicide is explored, highlighting the existence of two distinct types of death: one that is a flight from pain, unbearable memory, or the collapse of relationships, and another that is an arrival, seeking the obliteration of illusion and the annihilation of the false self.
- The first type of death is described as pathological, seeking relief, and is often the result of the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f) giving up on an individual, whereas the second type is liturgical, seeking clarity, and is the result of an individual giving up on the world.

## **Authentic and Inauthentic Suicide**

- The text emphasizes that the line between these two types of death is thin and often only visible after it has been crossed, and it is crucial not to romanticize or aestheticize the act of suicide.
- The dominant cultural script views all suicide as a symptom of depression, trauma, mental illness, or biochemical imbalance, which is a valid perspective, but it does not account for a category of encounter with death that is rooted in philosophical insight rather than psychological distress.
- This category is explored in the writings of mystics, ascetics, and philosophers such as those found in Buddhism's anatta doctrine, Gnostic traditions, and the works of Schopenhauer and Cioran, who approach death as a logical conclusion to the realization that the self is an illusion and that existence is inherently meaningless.
- [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) acknowledges the tension between inauthentic suicide, which is a reactive response to suffering, and authentic suicide, which is a ritual severance from ontological illusion, and refuses to simplify this distinction.
- Inauthentic suicide is characterized as a reactive response to unbearable circumstances, whereas authentic suicide is an ontological response to the recognition that existence itself is structurally unsalvageable, regardless of circumstances.

## **The Paradox of Existential Continuation**

- The text concludes that the difference between inauthentic and authentic suicide lies not in the method, but in the stance toward existence that precedes the act, with inauthentic suicide being driven by anguish and authentic suicide being driven by a philosophical recognition of the inherent meaninglessness of existence.
- The concept of authentic suicide is explored in the context of Nihiltheism, where the self recognizes the illusion of personal identity and the projection of meaning, and refuses to continue pretending, which is seen as a form of clarity rather than despair.
- According to [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c), authentic suicide is philosophically coherent, as the decision to end existence is no less rational than the decision to continue it, especially when considering that continuation requires constant denial of the absurdity of being.

## **The Biological and Philosophical Barriers**

- Various traditions, such as [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a6d31634-6ad7-47bc-9ede-d986f8f1229e) and the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Cioran, approach the idea of authentic suicide with caution, recognizing it as a form of continued craving or attachment to existence, and emphasizing the difficulty of enacting it in practice.
- Nihiltheism inherits this suspension of authentic suicide, acknowledging that while it may be theoretically coherent, it is practically impossible due to biological override, residual attachment to existence, or the fact that the self is still invested in meaning.
- Three possible answers are proposed to explain why individuals do not enact authentic suicide, including biological override, where the organism's survival instinct overrides philosophical conviction, residual attachment, where some part of the self still clings to beauty, curiosity, or hope, and the idea that authentic suicide may not require biological cessation, but rather the cessation of the self's investment in meaning.

## **Dying Before Death: Ego Dissolution**

- The concept of "dying before you die" is introduced, where the self stops investing in narratives and treating life as if it had significance, becoming a ghost in its own life, and achieving ego death without biological cessation, which is seen as a form of authentic suicide that is phenomenological rather than biological.
- The ideas of various philosophers, including Schopenhauer and Cioran, are referenced to highlight the complexity and nuance of the concept of authentic suicide, and to emphasize that even those who theorize about it may not necessarily enact it in practice, due to residual attachment to existence or the organism's instinct for survival.
- The concept of authentic suicide is explored in the context of [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c), which does not choose between different answers but rather holds them in suspension, including the distinction between suicide-as-flight and suicide-as-refusal, with the former driven by suffering and the latter driven by clarity.

## **The Absurd and the Futility of Rebellion**

- Nihiltheism poses the question of why one would continue to exist after recognizing the illusion of the self and the absurdity of existence, and whether this continuation is a form of cowardice or a strange fidelity to the absurd, with philosophers like [Camus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5aa7f182-29a0-42e6-8225-0c5e138f3558) and Cioran offering different perspectives on this issue.
- The idea of rebellion against the absurd, as proposed by Camus, is questioned by Nihiltheism, which asks if this rebellion is enough or if it is still a form of clinging to meaning, and whether the continued existence of someone like Cioran, who wrote about the futility of writing, is a form of cowardice or a kind of answer to the question of existence.
- Nihiltheism offers no resolution to the question of existence, but rather presents the wound that if life is meaningless, death is no more meaningful, and if the self is an illusion, there is no "you" to be liberated by cessation, leaving the individual with the choice between two forms of unbearable honesty.

## **De-Experience as Ontological Surgery**

- The concept of de-experience as praxis is introduced, which involves the deliberate collapse of the subject-object frame that structures all perception, allowing for awareness without content and a rupture from the fiction of the self and the boundary between the self and the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f).
- This de-experiencing is not a loss of awareness, but rather awareness that is no longer tethered to a self that is aware, and is not directed towards objects that are seen, leaving the individual with a new perspective on existence and the self, as proposed in the section titled "DE-EXPERIENCE AS PRAXIS".
- The section from the document 'Mem' discusses the dissolution of the subject-object grammar, where the Void becomes palpable as the absence of the thinker, and this experience is not enlightenment, but rather the annihilation of the category that could be enlightened.

## **The Collapse of Subject-Object Grammar**

- Ordinary experience is structured by a grammar that includes a subject, an object, and an action that connects them, which is a fundamental aspect of human cognition and a survival tool that helps the organism distinguish self from not-self.
- This structure is not ontologically grounded, but rather a construct that is useful and perhaps necessary, but ultimately arbitrary, and in certain states, such as those reported by Buddhists, Advaita Vedantists, mystics, phenomenologists, and psychonauts, the line between subject and object dissolves.
- The dissolution of the subject-object frame has been reported under various names, including anatta, nirvikalpa samadhi, unio mystica, pre-reflective awareness, and ego death, but [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) takes these reports seriously without baptizing them or attributing them to a higher power.

## **The Characteristics of De-Experience**

- The experience of de-experiencing, or the cessation of the experiential frame, is not describable in the grammar of ordinary experience, and it feels like being seen from nowhere, with awareness continuing but no locus, and the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f) not being separate or distant.
- In de-experience, the interiority is evacuated, and the inner theater where thoughts and feelings arise is empty, with thoughts appearing like clouds in an empty sky, and no one is thinking them, and they dissolve.
- The collapse of time is also a characteristic of de-experience, where memory and anticipation are functions of the self, and when the self dissolves, time does not flow, and there is no narrative arc, and there is only the present moment, which is unmoving and eternal, and feels like the sacred, but not because anything divine has appeared.

## **The Risks and Realities of De-Experience**

- The concept of de-experience is introduced as a state where the ordinary structures that make the world feel mundane are stripped away, leaving only raw existence without meaning, reference, or purpose, which can be overwhelming and even dangerous for the organism.
- De-experience is not celebrated as liberation in [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c), but rather named as a rupture that reveals the contingency of the structure of consciousness and carries existential risk, with some individuals returning with clarity, others with trauma, and some not returning at all.
- To understand Nothingness, de-experience is unavoidable, as thought is always structured by the subject-object frame and implies a thinker standing at a distance from what is thought, whereas the Void is the absence of the structure that makes objects possible.

## **Praxis of De-Experience**

- De-experience as praxis involves the deliberate and sustained attempt to inhabit the space where the self is not, by sitting still, not focusing on an object, not narrating, and not seeking calm or insight, but rather noticing when the subject-object frame arises and letting it fall.
- This practice is described as ontological surgery without anesthetic, where the structure that makes experience coherent is cut away, revealing the place where the self was never real to begin with, and allowing the individual to encounter the Void in a direct and unmediated way.
- The concept of faith is redefined as negative faith, which involves the decision to trust Nothingness and surrender away from all gods, comforts, and answers, rather than leaping towards a God or presence, and is characterized by loyalty to absence and the un-redeemable.

## **Negative Faith and the Void**

- Negative faith does not ask for miracles or redemption, but rather encounters the groundless ground and the silence that remains when all promises have collapsed, and is distinct from atheism, representing a unique perspective on the nature of existence and the human condition.
- The fourth incantation, "To know the Void, you must become the Void," suggests that the individual must stop being and stop experiencing in the normal way in order to directly encounter the Void, which is described as vast, silent, and not empty.
- The concept of atheism is introduced as the negation of God, and negative faith is defined as the affirmation of God's non-being as the only sacred posture left, which is a distinct approach from traditional faith that operates by affirming the unseen and providing structure, meaning, community, and consolation.

## **Disciplines of Negative Faith**

- Traditional faith is described as an existential gamble, where individuals choose to believe in God and trust that suffering has purpose, but negative faith emerges when this gamble is no longer possible, and the individual is left with nothing but the question that has no answer.
- Negative faith is not a replacement for traditional faith, but rather its inversion, where the individual trusts the Void and the absence of ground, and this trust is not about being saved, but about honesty and fidelity to the truth, as noted in the concept of Recursive Elaboration.
- The disciplines of negative faith are outlined, including the refusal of consolation, where the individual sits with the unbearable without seeking relief, and negative prayer, where the individual speaks into the silence without expecting an answer, as a form of confession and fidelity to the Real.

## **The Peace of Unreliable Truth**

- Additional disciplines of negative faith include the liturgy of absence, where rituals are created to mark absence, and fidelity to Nothingness, where the individual reminds themselves that meaning is temporary and projection, and that the void is still present underneath every meaning built, which is a concept that requires vigilance and the refusal to let comfort erode honesty.
- The practice of negative faith is described as brutal and offering no reward, but those who practice it report a kind of peace, not the peace of reassurance, but the peace of no longer lying, which is a concept that is distinct from the ideas of Pascal's wager and traditional faith.
- The concept of peace is introduced as the alignment between what one knows and how they live, which is not about redemption, but about embracing the reality of a situation, even if it is terrible, and finding honesty in the absence of false comforts and promises.

## **Incantations of the Void**

- The idea of negative faith is presented as a form of devotion to what does not exist, where one is faithful to the truth of Nothingness, and this fidelity becomes a kind of sanctity because it is the only form of honesty left when all other beliefs are gone.
- The fifth incantation, "Believe in nothing," is not about negation, but about embracing the reality that the universe is indifferent, and worshiping the Void because it is the only real thing left, rather than hoping for salvation.
- The concept of ontological suffocation is introduced, which is the feeling of being trapped in existence, with no escape from the fact of being, and no explanation or justification for why anything exists.

## **Ontological Suffocation and the Weight of Being**

- This suffocation is described as a pressure that is not driven by fear, dread, or suffering, but by the awareness that existence is without reason or purpose, and that being is a brute fact that is contingent, groundless, and inexplicable.
- The question "Why is there something rather than nothing?" is posed, which is often treated as a theological or cosmological puzzle, but for those who encounter it existentially, it is a wound that asks for justification, not explanation, and the answer is that there is no reason or purpose behind existence.
- The philosopher [Leibniz](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/38460a82-8c19-4e35-987b-8b2d42805f71) is mentioned as the one who originally posed the question, and the concept of ontological suffocation is distinguished from existential dread, as described by Heidegger, which is the anxiety of encountering Nothingness, whereas ontological suffocation is the horror of encountering being itself as inescapable.

## **The Experience of Existential Suffocation**

- The concept of ontological suffocation is described as a chronic and overwhelming feeling of being trapped in existence, which is exemplified by the character Roquentin's nausea in front of a tree root in Jean-Paul Sartre's work, where the root's sheer existence is perceived as excessive and obscene.
- This feeling of suffocation is not just a momentary experience, but a constant awareness of one's existence, and the inability to escape or find relief from it, as even death is not a cessation of being, but rather a transition or an unknown.
- The intensity of this suffocation is heightened by the fact that others seem to be oblivious to it, going about their daily lives without being crushed by the weight of existence, and instead finding meaning and purpose in their lives, which is in stark contrast to those who feel the suffocation.

## **Depersonalization and the Ninth Incantation**

- The recognition that being has no ground, no reason, and no justification is what leads to this feeling of suffocation, and it is not a symptom of mental illness, but rather a correct response to the contingency and inexplicability of existence.
- The philosophy of [nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) does not offer any relief or comfort, but rather acknowledges that the feeling of suffocation is a natural consequence of being aware of the groundlessness of existence, and that it is a sign of being awake and aware.
- However, in the depths of this suffocation, there is a recognition that the pressure of existence is not a command or a demand, but simply a fact, and that the individual is not obligated to justify their existence, which leads to a shift in perspective, where the suffocation becomes transparent, and the individual sees that they are part of the weight of being, rather than being separate from it.

## **The Other and the Numinous**

- This shift in perspective does not lift the suffocation, but rather allows the individual to see that it is not a personal problem, but rather an ontological condition, a condition of existence itself, and that the boundary between the individual and being dissolves, allowing for a new understanding of the self and its place in existence.
- The concept of depersonalization is introduced, where the unbearable becomes bearable not because it is less heavy, but because one is no longer trying to escape it, and this is referred to as the ninth incantation: Being has no reason, it simply is, and one is trapped inside it, with the trap also being what one is, and the advice is to stop trying to escape and breathe inside the suffocation.
- The idea of the Other is explored, which is described as something that is neither God, nor self, nor absence, nor presence, but the alien paradox encountered when all familiar categories collapse, and it is not nameable, not knowable, and does not reveal itself because it has no identity.

## **The Structure of the Other's Encounter**

- The Other is said to rupture into awareness as the thing that cannot be assimilated, cannot be understood, and cannot be integrated into any framework, and when encountered, it destroys perception even as perception occurs, erases the individual, and leaves a mark of having been encountered by what should not be possible.
- The concept of the Other is also discussed in the context of phenomenology, where it appears as the problem of other minds, and the irreducible gap between one's experience and another's, and this recognition of the Other as another subject is both immediate and mysterious.
- The idea of [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) is introduced, which pushes the concept of the Other further, suggesting that it is not just other people, but the structure of radical unknowability that appears wherever the self's categories fail, and it can be encountered in peak experiences of ego dissolution, existential horror, and the gap between question and answer.

## **The Indifference of the Cosmos**

- The concept of the numinous, as described by [Rudolf Otto](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c8e82847-a175-475d-9d74-0795ccfd6b28), is also explored, which refers to the experience of the holy as mysterium tremendum et fascinans, the mystery that is both terrifying and fascinating, and this experience is not reducible to moral goodness or cosmic order, but is a raw encounter with the sacred as the wholly Other.
- The philosopher Levinas is mentioned, who argued that the Other makes an ethical demand on the individual precisely because it is irreducible to understanding, and this structure applies not just to ethics, but also metaphysically, where the Other is what exceeds one's conceptual framework and cannot be assimilated.
- The encounter with the Other in Nihiltheism is considered sacred because it is a real experience that breaks through the ordinary and reveals that there is more to reality than what is initially perceived, and this encounter occurs when the self is annihilated and the filter of personal categories and expectations is broken.

## **The Absurd and the Critique of Rebellion**

- The structure of the encounter with the Other can be described in four key points: Alienation, where the Other feels alien and unfamiliar; Inescapability, where once the Other has appeared, it cannot be unseen and leaves a permanent mark on one's perception; Unspeakability, where language fails to describe the encounter because it occurs outside the subject-object frame; and Ambiguity, where the encounter does not resolve into clear meaning and leaves one with uncertainty.
- The Other is not God, but it is also not nothing, and it is not the self, and when encountered, it is irreducibly real in a way that nothing else is, and this encounter is what justifies the use of the word "sacred" in [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c).
- Nihiltheism does not worship the Other or build theology around it, but rather acknowledges that if one goes deep enough into the Void, they will encounter something that is not the Void, or perhaps the Void with a face that does not explain itself, and this encounter is what makes the concept of the sacred meaningful.

## **Radical Futility and the Sisyphus Paradox**

- The tenth incantation of Nihiltheism states that the Other is not God, but it is also not the self and not nothing, and when one meets it, they will understand why humans invented gods, not to explain the Other, but to survive having met it, and this encounter is a rupture that reveals the absurd and radical futility of human longing for meaning in a cosmos that does not care about human existence.
- The concept of indifference is discussed in the context of the universe's inability to respond to human existence, highlighting that humans are merely a configuration of matter that has become aware of itself and invented narratives to make this awareness bearable, but these narratives are not true.
- The idea of the absurd, as introduced by [Camus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5aa7f182-29a0-42e6-8225-0c5e138f3558), is the collision between humanity's need for meaning and the universe's refusal to provide it, leading to a sense of existential crisis and the realization that human existence is absurd because we demand meaning in a universe that provides none.

## **The Biology of Existential Continuation**

- Camus's solution to the absurd is rebellion, where he argues that despite the lack of cosmic meaning, individuals can create their own meaning and live fully and defiantly in the face of the absurd, as seen in his conclusion that "we must imagine Sisyphus happy".
- However, [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) critiques Camus's rebellion as still being a form of affirmation, where the individual is claiming significance and mattering, even if it is subjective, and instead argues that even subjective experience of meaning is groundless and an illusion created by the organism to survive.
- Radical futility, a concept related to Nihiltheism, claims that life is empty and that no amount of defiant meaning-making can change this emptiness, and that even the concept of "you" is not stable and is a shifting process of neurons and hormones and narratives that are not under one's control.

## **Negative Enlightenment and the Rupture-Node**

- The story of Sisyphus is used to illustrate the idea of radical futility, where Sisyphus is not rebelling or affirming, but simply pushing the rock because it is biologically impossible to stop, and that the purpose and meaning he finds in this task are simulations and performances created by the organism to avoid pain and seek repetitive tasks.
- Ultimately, Nihiltheism inherits the recognition from the absurd that human projects are cosmically irrelevant, but refuses Camus's consolation of rebellion and instead concludes that individuals are like Sisyphus, pushing the rock without happiness or unhappiness, simply because it is what the organism is programmed to do.
- The concept of rebellion is deemed ineffective as it implies that resistance and meaning-making are possible, but in reality, they are not, and the futility of existence is simply a description of the neutral cosmos in which we exist.

## **The Collapse of Identity and Anatta**

- The pain and suffering felt by individuals are not existential, but rather biological, as the organism resists its own dissolution and insists that life must have meaning, despite being wrong in this assumption.
- There are three possible reasons why individuals continue to exist despite the futility of life: residual attachment to the idea that maybe there is a way out or something that will give life meaning, biological incapability of stopping due to evolutionary drives, or indifference to the futility of life, having passed through the horror of it and arrived at a state of transparency.
- [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c) notes that all three possibilities are live options and that individuals will oscillate between them, with some days being spent clinging to hope, some days functioning solely on biological drives, and some days achieving transparency and indifference.

## **Living as No One**

- The concept of Nihiltheism is not about choosing among these possibilities, but rather about recognizing that they are all futile, and that even the act of articulating this philosophy is futile, driven solely by the organism's drive to understand and make sense, even when it knows that understanding is impossible.
- The idea of enlightenment is also reexamined, with the concept of "negative enlightenment" suggesting that awakening reveals not truth, but the impossibility of truth, and that the moment of clarity is the moment when all clarity dissolves, leaving only the recognition that there is nothing to know and no ground on which knowing could stand, as discussed in the concept of the "Rupture-Node" and the eleventh incantation of Nihiltheism.
- The philosopher [Albert Camus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5aa7f182-29a0-42e6-8225-0c5e138f3558) is referenced, with his concept of the heroic Sisyphus being contrasted with the idea of Sisyphus as an automaton, stripped of narrative and interiority, highlighting the difference between a hopeful and a hopeless existence.

## **Sacred Boredom and the Void**

- Ultimately, the text concludes that even though futility is total, the organism continues to try to understand and make sense, and it is this drive that leads to the creation of philosophical systems like [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c), which recognizes the futility of its own existence, and that the only real mystery left is why futility does not stop us from continuing to exist and try to make sense of the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f).
- The concept of negative enlightenment is introduced as a state where an individual becomes nothing, and the self that sought enlightenment is annihilated by the clarity it sought, resulting in awareness without subject, seeing without seer, and presence without anyone present.
- Traditional enlightenment, as seen in [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a6d31634-6ad7-47bc-9ede-d986f8f1229e), Advaita Vedanta, and mystical Christianity, promises fulfillment and liberation, where the individual transcends the limited self and realizes their true nature, bringing peace, freedom, clarity, and bliss.

## **The Stages of Sacred Boredom**

- Negative enlightenment inverts this concept, suggesting that there is no true nature to realize, and the self that seeks liberation is the only thing standing between the individual and the void, revealing not a higher Self but No Self.
- This state is not peaceful, but rather annihilating, and is characterized by the clearest seeing possible, where there is nothing to see, no one to see it, and no ground on which seeing could occur, which is referred to as nihilism as wakefulness.
- The experience of negative enlightenment feels like cessation, where the internal narrative stops, and the voice in the head that narrates life falls silent, not because it has been quieted, but because the "you" that it was narrating has dissolved.

## **The Broken Absolute and Epistemology**

- In this state, thoughts and sensations still arise, but they are not attached to anyone, and the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f) continues, but the individual is not in it, resulting in a state that is terrifying at first, as the organism interprets the dissolution of the self as death.
- Negative enlightenment is permanent, and once it occurs, the individual does not "return to normal" because there is no "you" to return, and the structure of selfhood does not reassemble, although the organism continues to function, and the brain continues to generate thoughts and memories.
- The concept of negative enlightenment is distinct from traditional notions of enlightenment, and is not described using terms like "pure awareness" or "true Self", but rather as a state of witnessing that is empty, and a non-experience that cannot be described in the grammar of experience.

## **The Failure of Reference and Meaning**

- The concept of a stable self or identity is an illusion, and once this illusion is seen through, it collapses, leaving the individual with a sense of detachment from their thoughts, choices, and actions, as if they are watching a character in a film.
- This collapse of identity, referred to as "negative enlightenment," is not a state of liberation, wisdom, or freedom from bondage, because the idea of a self that can be bound or freed is also an illusion.
- Negative enlightenment is characterized by the dissolution of the knower, the recognition that knowledge is provisional and constructed, and the exposure of the illusion of selfhood, which cannot be unexposed once it has been seen through.

## **Pragmatism and Operative Adequacy**

- The goal of spiritual practice is not to achieve negative enlightenment, because having a goal implies the existence of a self that can achieve it, and negative enlightenment reveals that there was never anyone seeking or anything to be found.
- Negative enlightenment, as described by [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c), is the end of illusion, where the individual sees through the illusion of selfhood and is left with a sense of transparency, raw reality, and unmediated experience, which can be overwhelming due to its indifference to the individual's needs and expectations.
- The text also explores the idea that the self is not a stable entity, but a flickering pattern, a narrative constructed by the brain to create the illusion of continuity, and that this narrative is a functional lie that helps the organism navigate the [world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9eb13522-8a98-4cab-97da-bd85f512c45f), but is nonetheless a lie that can be seen through, leading to the collapse of identity.

## **Deep Time and the Erasure of Meaning**

- The collapse of identity is described as immediate, irreversible, and leaving the individual as a ghost narrating its own absence, highlighting the impermanent and chaotic nature of the self and the world, and the idea that there is no stable core or essence, only process and directionless change.
- The concept of the self in [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a6d31634-6ad7-47bc-9ede-d986f8f1229e) is considered an illusion, referred to as Anatta or no-self, which suggests that the idea of a unified self is not based on a permanent essence or substance, but rather on a bundle of aggregates, including form, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness, that arise and interact together.
- These aggregates are not bound together by any permanent connection, but rather occur in proximity, leading the mind to mistakenly perceive them as a unified self, a concept that is supported by Western philosophers such as Hume, Nietzsche, and Parfit, who have also argued that the self is not a fixed entity.

## **The Hypocrisy of Practical Normalcy**

- The collapse of identity, which can occur through various means such as trauma, meditation, or existential crisis, leads to a sudden recognition that the self is not a real entity, resulting in a feeling of depersonalization, temporal disintegration, and existential transparency, where the past, present, and future are no longer perceived as belonging to a personal self.
- This experience can be terrifying at first, as the organism interprets the loss of self as an existential threat, but ultimately leads to a sense of relief, as the burden of maintaining a self-image and protecting one's identity is lifted, allowing for a state of being that is functional but empty, aware but not identified, and alive but not inhabited.
- The philosophers Hume, Nietzsche, and Parfit are mentioned as having reached similar conclusions about the nature of the self, with Hume finding only a "bundle of perceptions", Nietzsche declaring the self a "grammatical fiction", and Parfit arguing that personal identity is not what matters, but rather psychological continuity and conventional boundaries between persons.

## **The Religion of the Void**

- The concept of Anatta and the collapse of identity are central to the idea of [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/77bc0e60-b0b5-45d4-9f5d-373d4016566c), which inherits these ideas and takes them further, suggesting that the self is not only an illusion, but also a source of suffering, and that its collapse can lead to a kind of liberation, not in the romantic sense, but rather in the sense of being released from the tyranny of identity and the need to maintain a self-image.
- The concept of "no self" is discussed, where [Buddhism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) suggests that recognizing the absence of a self leads to the cessation of suffering, whereas Nihiltheism states that there is no self, period, with no promise of cessation or reward, and the realization of this fact only makes pretending to have a self more difficult.
- The idea of living as "no one" is explored, where the organism continues to function, and thoughts, decisions, and actions occur without a sense of agency, making life a series of meaningless events that simply happen, like natural phenomena, without any significance or tragedy.

## **Rituals of the Void**

- The thirteenth incantation, "You do not exist, you never did," is introduced, emphasizing that the knowing of this fact changes nothing, as there is no self to change, and the body will continue to function until it stops, at which point nothing will have ended, because nothing ever began.
- The concept of "sacred boredom" is discussed, which is described as the first liturgy of the void, where one confronts the absence of novelty, possibility, and significance, and everything feels empty, mechanical, and endlessly repeating, leading to a state of weightlessness and the evacuation of desire.
- Sacred boredom is distinguished from ordinary boredom, which is reactive and seeks novelty, whereas sacred boredom is the recognition that novelty itself is exhausted, and one has tried all experiences, relationships, and projects, only to find that they are all variations on the same empty theme.

## **The Melancholy Metaphysician**

- The state of sacred boredom is characterized by a sense of flatness, where time slows, days blur together, and one performs the minimum necessary functions without enthusiasm or investment, and it is not tragic, but simply a state of being, as understood by philosopher Schopenhauer.
- The concept of [Nihiltheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/undefined) is introduced, which argues that life oscillates between suffering and boredom, and that boredom is closer to truth than desire because it reveals that existence has no intrinsic value.
- According to Nihiltheism, sacred boredom is not something to escape, but rather something to inhabit, as it is the first taste of the Void, and when one stops seeking novelty and manufacturing meaning, they encounter the groundlessness of being.
