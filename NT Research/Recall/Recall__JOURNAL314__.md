- The author recognizes that they are promoting their beliefs due to their perceived truth, regardless of the consequences, similar to what they criticize others for doing, and that this pursuit of truth is a fundamental human drive, as seen in the desire for the "many-worlds" hypothesis to be true or the possibility of uploading consciousness onto different hardware.

## The Concept of Nihiltheism

- The author engages with the concept of nihilism, referencing the ideas of Nietzsche, who suggested that "Nihilism might be a divine way of thinking", and that experiencing nihilism is necessary to understand the true value of values, with the author proposing that nihilism may be a divine way of thinking in the sense that the negation of all values can lead to a perfect value in God.
- The text also touches on the idea that nihilists are stuck in a cycle of saying "no" to all values, and that this can lead to a form of despair and elimination, rather than a heroic or courageous stance, with the author distinguishing between passive and active nihilism, and suggesting that the latter is not a desirable or sustainable position.
- The author of the JOURNAL314 document discusses various philosophical concepts, including Nihilism, and how it relates to the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche, who saw Nihilism as a "physiological decadence" and believed that the material world should not be de-valued in comparison to a "true world".
- The author also touches on the idea that intrinsic value is more important than arbitrary emotional states or contingent actualizations, and notes the self-contradictory nature of Nihilism, questioning whether Nietzsche truly believed in the concept of physiological decadence.

- The author references the ideas of other philosophers, including Krishnamurti, who said that "Total negation is the essence of the positive", and Colin Feltham, who discusses the limitations and contradictions of psychology and psychotherapy, suggesting that it is often more effective due to simple listening and support rather than its theories and techniques.
- Feltham's concept of Depressive Realism (DR) is also discussed, and the author notes that being a DR can be taboo, particularly in certain professions, and that many people are uncomfortable around pessimists, which can have negative consequences for one's career and economic well-being.
- The author reflects on the idea that "hate" can be stronger than "love", and questions the concept of existence and the universe, suggesting that Buddhism may not be correct in its positing of existence, and that the idea of a "true world" is not relevant in this context.

## The Critique of Earthly Concerns
- The author of the Journal314 document discusses their experiences with being a proponent of Disaster Realism (DR) or Nihilism, stating that many people do not understand or accept their views, often dismissing them due to their own political, spiritual, or personal hopes and enjoyments in life.
- The author notes that admitting to being a DR or Nihilist can be likened to admitting to having a disease, as it can lead to social exclusion and a decrease in social invitations, and even in some cultures, such as in Kenya, atheism or Nihilism is viewed as a form of insanity.
- The author expresses their desire for authentic and unpolished writings, preferring to see an author's raw thoughts and ideas rather than a polished, finished product, citing the example of Francious Laruelle, who spent his life working without an audience.
- The author critiques the common interpretation of Socrates' philosophy, particularly his statement "knowing nothing," arguing that it is often misinterpreted as a form of humility rather than a genuine expression of Nihilism, which is the awareness that all human knowledge is ultimately worth nothing.
- The author distinguishes between Pessimism and Nihilism, stating that Socrates' hopeful pessimism is different from their own despairing Nihilism, and that Socrates' philosophy is often taught in a way that ignores its true Nihilistic implications, instead presenting it as a form of optimism or humility.
- The author argues that the true value of Socrates' philosophy lies in its ability to reveal the nothingness of human knowledge, and that only by acknowledging and accepting this nothingness can one truly begin to discuss meaningful topics, such as the existence of God or an afterlife, rather than living in an illusion and discussing phantoms.
- The concept of alienation or "experience" discussed by Socrates in the Apology and Plato in the allegory of the cave is related to the idea of Nothingness, which is a fundamental aspect of Nihilism, a philosophy that predates Christianity and is not strictly tied to it.
- The need for an "Other world" is seen as the cause of Nihilism, and this idea is not unique to Christianity, but rather a universal human concern that stems from an ignorance about God and His existence.
- The author agrees with Socrates that the outcome of death is unknown, and therefore, it is not the enemy of the philosopher, but rather life and its inherent Nothingness that can be despised.
- The author also references Nietzsche's response to Nihilism, which suggests that life is worthless and meaningless, and that instead of trying to build up this world, one should hope for the "Other world" mentioned by Socrates.

## The Concept of the Other Realm
- The author argues that philosophy should be concerned with God and the ultimate questions that relate to Him, and that human knowledge must have an end or purpose, which cannot be solely human-centered.
- The text also critiques the idea of seeking Truth and morality in a valueless universe, suggesting that human knowledge is worthless and that all values are relative, and instead proposes a form of free thinking that questions everything.
- The author references the concept of dialetheism, which suggests that all knowledge can be both true and false at the same time, and wonders if there is any purpose to human existence, or if it is simply a personal hell to be endured.

- Ultimately, the author is left with the question of how to spend one's time in a seemingly meaningless world, and whether to adopt a pessimistic attitude or to hold onto hope and experience.
- The author of the JOURNAL314 document is struggling to cope with their despair and is questioning the purpose of their existence, feeling that life is a joke and that emotions such as happiness, sadness, and fear are worthless instincts.

- The author of the JOURNAL314 document expresses a sense of nihilism, stating that there is no such thing as "wrong" and that morality is not real because it assumes human importance, whereas no human is truly important in the grand scheme of things.
- The author believes that individuals should not be bound by the judgments of others and should instead focus on their own desires, reading and writing for personal fulfillment, and that a person's perceived "faults" are simply a part of who they are and may be seen as insecurities by others.
- The author references various philosophers and writers, including Ayn Rand and Nietzsche, criticizing their views on topics such as drinking and the existence of problems, and instead suggests that there are no real problems, only an empty reality.
- The author quotes C.S. Lewis's book "A Grief Observed", which explores the idea that reality is unbearable and that human consciousness is a phenomenon that allows us to see and recoil from this reality, and that death reveals the vacuity that was always present in human existence.
- The author questions the point of trying to think about God or anything else if reality is meaningless, but suggests that occupying oneself with highest ideals may be the next best thing to do with one's time, and that the choice is ultimately up to the individual.
- The author also references Tolstoy's "Confession" and the idea that a life contemplating God is the only thing worth anything in a world devoid of significance, and quotes Jesus' statement that no distinction should be made between those who do good and those who do evil, as this is a human concept that cannot grasp the infinite realm of goodness.
- Throughout the document, the author grapples with existential questions and the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world, and expresses a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity about the nature of existence and the human condition.

## The Critique of Worldly Desires
- The concept of a world where Good and Evil are insignificant in comparison to God is discussed, with philosophers such as Augustine and Nietzsche agreeing with Jesus on this idea, suggesting that God is the ultimate reality that transcends human notions of morality.
- The text also explores the idea that human conversations are often self-centered, and that true communication is difficult to achieve, as stated in the quote "A dialogue is just two monologues that are clashing," highlighting the challenges of genuine interaction with others.
- Tolstoy's views on human nature are examined, particularly his idea that the collapse of human-made contrivances can lead to a more objective understanding of morality, which is in line with the ethics of Jesus, and that nihilism can ultimately lead to a deeper understanding of God, as God is seen as the embodiment of nothingness.
- The text raises questions about the purpose of spiritual journeys and the search for meaning, suggesting that these searches may be in vain, and that all deaths can be considered premature, leaving the question of what one is to do in the face of such uncertainty.
- The narrative also touches on the theme of social justice, citing an example of a destitute person being taken to a police station, highlighting the contrast between the haves and have-nots, and the moral obligation to help those in need, as exemplified by Tolstoy's personal experience of feeling guilty for not helping a beggar and realizing that he shares in the crime of inequality by not giving up his luxuries.
- The author notes that people are often unwilling to give up their comforts and luxuries to help others, and that discussing such ideas can make others uncomfortable, as they may feel ashamed or guilty for not taking action, but ultimately, they may express approval for the idea while doubting its success, as seen in the reactions of the newspaper editor, the author's son, wife, and others to his article on the topic.
- The section from the document '**JOURNAL314**' discusses the concept of helping others and the nature of happiness, highlighting that people from all walks of life, whether rich or poor, are dissatisfied with their current situation and desire something better, with the author referencing the ideas of Maya and Zapffe to illustrate the psychological condition of never being satisfied.
- The author notes that one must change their outlook on life in order to be content, and that love and pity are often used as a means to an end, with people responding to these emotions in a way that is driven by their own desires and views of life, as seen in the examples of mothers leading their daughters to taverns or to court.
- The text also references Tolstoy's realization that giving material goods is not an effective way to help others, as people are often driven by their own desires and may only see the giver as a dispenser of money, and that true help requires a deeper understanding of the underlying issues and a change in one's outlook on life.
- The author emphasizes the importance of elucidating moral truth and living in accordance with moral laws, stating that this is the sole business of humanity, and that material charity is not a substitute for spiritual support, as illustrated by the example of a person who drinks all that is given to them and remains cold and hungry.

## The Importance of Seeking the Kingdom of God
- The section concludes by highlighting the complexities of helping others and the need for a genuine and selfless approach, noting that if one has more than others, they cannot help but give, and that drawing back from giving reveals that one's actions were motivated by a desire to seem kindly rather than a genuine desire to help, with the author referencing Tolstoy's thoughts on the matter.
- The author of the Journal314 reflects on the idea that one's actions and priorities in life should be reevaluated, particularly in comparison to the wealthy, such as Tolstoy, who could have given more to those in need, and notes that the sight of hungry and cold people at Lyapin House evoked a sense of guilt and responsibility.
- The author discusses the concept of objectivity and morality, referencing Jesus' teachings, which seem to contradict the values of the world, and suggests that devaluing the world is necessary to truly experience God and live according to moral obligations.

- The author discusses the relationship between religion and morality, quoting Tolstoy's opinion that the chief error impeding the progress of Christian humanity is the distortion of Christianity by scientific men who are guided by pagan conceptions of life.
- The author notes that this distortion leads to a lack of understanding of true Christianity and its perfect conception of life, and that science, despite its successes, appears to be unnecessary or pernicious when it comes to human existence.
- The author also touches on the idea of freedom, suggesting that true freedom is only a God-like reality and that it is freedom from anxiety, which can be achieved through a connection with a higher power, as facilitated by experiences such as listening to Bach or using cannabis.
- The author references Terence McKenna's idea that God is not an idea, but a lost continent in the human mind, and suggests that cannabis and Bach are just two of the many voices of God that can help individuals connect with this higher reality.

- The section from the document '**JOURNAL314**' discusses the relationship between Nihilism and Christianity, suggesting that Jesus can be seen as a pessimist and a nihilist, as he devalued earthly existence and emphasized the importance of a higher power.
- The text quotes William James, who states that healthy-mindedness is inadequate as a philosophical doctrine because it fails to account for the evil facts that are a genuine part of reality, and that these facts may be the key to understanding life's significance.
- The author argues that Nihilism and God are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary, and that Nihilism can be seen as a correct description of a worthless existence, with the infallible rule being to have no care for the earthly world.
- The text also references the idea that Jesus' kingdom is not of this world, and that he devalued the family in order to raise up the entire human race, which can be seen as a form of nihilistic thinking.

## The Influence of Various Spiritual Leaders
- The author criticizes psychiatry for trying to cure what is true, and instead suggests that God needs to be the answer for Nihilism, implying that Nihilism is a legitimate perspective that can be addressed through spirituality.
- The text quotes an unnamed author, possibly Ligoi, who discusses the pessimistic worldview and the concern for human suffering, stating that remedies for suffering may be discovered, but that human suffering will remain insoluble as long as human beings exist.
- The author notes that the Nihilist's concern for suffering is not grounded in any moral framework, but rather is a result of being drawn to the farthest consequences of a naturalistic worldview, and that this perspective can be seen as a form of nihilistic thinking that is compatible with Christianity.
- The section from the document '**JOURNAL314**' discusses the concept of Nihilism and its relationship with a theistic worldview, suggesting that if a Nihilist were to follow their own worldview to its conclusions, they would realize that the worthlessness of existence entails the worthlessness of suffering, and that this understanding can lead to a path towards God.
- The text argues that human suffering is not devalued in this perspective, but rather dealt with in a different fashion, where instead of trying to eliminate evil, one accepts and does not resist suffering, as exemplified by Jesus' approach to his own suffering and death.
- The idea of non-resistance is presented as a key aspect of faith, and it is noted that this path is narrow and not many people possess this quality, with Jesus' actions, such as washing the feet of Judas, serving as an example of this faith.
- The text also references the thoughts of Tolstoy, who believed that Jesus' teachings focused on how to live in this life in order to achieve a mysterious union with God, and that the "heavenly" world is distinct from the worldly existence.
- The concept of morality is reexamined in this context, suggesting that it is not about addressing earthly concerns such as suffering, social injustice, or poverty, but rather about contemplating and appreciating God, with all other concerns being distractions.
- The text touches on the idea that art, music, and science can still be important when considered in the context of discovering or experiencing God, and that Nihilism, while true in its interpretation of the world's worthlessness, is not the stopping point, but rather a stepping stone towards a deeper understanding of God.
- The section concludes by referencing the concept of anti-natalism and its potential compatibility with a belief in God, suggesting that even if everyone were to decide not to reproduce, leading to the extinction of humanity, this would not be problematic for God, as the message of the Truth has already been conveyed.

## The Critique of Earthly Morality
- The final part of the section includes quotes that emphasize the importance of desiring life and death, and the value of human existence, with the statement that a person must not say that fools are not worth saving, highlighting the inherent value of human beings.
- The text from the document "**JOURNAL314**" discusses the principles of Christianity and its approach to combining opposing ideas, allowing individuals to think highly of their soul while being humble about themselves.
- The author argues that Christianity requires a balance between contentment and dissatisfaction with the current state of things, and that simply accepting the status quo, as advised by the Stoic philosophy, is not sufficient.
- The text also critiques the idea of simply "grin and bear it," suggesting that true pleasure and satisfaction can only be achieved when one is fully engaged and invested in their experiences.
- The author notes that the concept of superiority or victory in nature is dependent on a philosophical framework, and that without such a framework, it is impossible to determine what constitutes "the best" or "superior."
- The text discusses the idea of Nature as a mother, which is a central tenet of pantheism, evolutionism, and modern cosmic religion, but argues that Christianity views Nature as a sister, allowing individuals to appreciate her beauty without feeling obligated to imitate her.

- The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of finding a balance between humility and haughtiness, and of cultivating a sense of reverence for the world around us, in order to develop a healthy and balanced attitude towards life.
- The text from the document "**JOURNAL314**" discusses the ideas of G. K. Chesterton, who criticizes the philosophies of Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Tolstoy, and Shaw, believing that they lead to mental helplessness and madness, which he defines as using mental activity to reach a state of mental helplessness.
- Chesterton argues that Christianity is hot enough to boil all modern society to rags, and that a person who is dependent on the luxuries of this life is corrupt, spiritually, politically, and financially, citing the words of Jesus in the Bible, such as in Luke 16:14-15 and Luke 18:18-30.

## The Concept of the Inward Way
- The text also quotes Chesterton as saying that pride is the downward drag of all things into an easy solemnity, and that seriousness is not a virtue, but rather a form of selfish seriousness that can lead to a sort of brown study, whereas a gay self-forgetfulness is necessary to rise above this solemnity.
- Furthermore, the text suggests that modern critics of religious authority are like men who attack the police without knowing about burglars, and that religious authority was established as a barrier against a great peril to the human mind, which is still necessary to avoid ruin.
- The brain of the believer is said to be stable, whereas the brains of unbelievers are seen to be reeling into extravagance, pessimism, and denial of life, seeking omens in nightmares and canons in contradictions, and fearing things beyond good and evil.
- The text concludes by citing Jesus' words to a ruler who asked about inheriting eternal life, saying that it is difficult for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God, and that one must sell all their possessions and follow Jesus to have treasure in heaven.

- The text references several biblical passages, including Luke 21:34-46, where Jesus warns against being weighed down by the cares of this life and advises staying awake and praying to escape the coming troubles, and John 18-19, where Jesus remains silent before Pilate, emphasizing that the kingdom is not of this world.
- The text also mentions the story of Jesus telling his disciple to put his sword back, saying that those who take the sword will perish by the sword, a message that was also taken by Tolstoy, who spoke about the importance of living according to God's commandment to avoid sin and suffering.
- Tolstoy's writings are referenced, including his experience of visiting a lodging and being deeply ashamed and grieved by the misery and suffering he saw, and his realization that his attempts to help were futile and that true change can only come from living according to God's commandment.
- The text includes quotes from Tolstoy's works, such as "What Shall We Do?", where he describes the dreadful conditions of a lodging and the people living there, and his feelings of shame and guilt, highlighting the need for spiritual transformation and the importance of following God's teachings.
- The story of an old man of eighty years, lying drunk and cursing, is also mentioned, illustrating the futility of worldly attempts to find happiness and fulfillment, and the need to seek a higher purpose and meaning in life.

## The Importance of Humility and Self-Denial
- Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of seeking a spiritual path and following God's teachings, rather than relying on worldly possessions and desires, and highlights the need for personal transformation and renunciation of worldly life to achieve true fulfillment and salvation.
- The text from the document "**JOURNAL314**" discusses the themes of poverty, wealth, and the responsibilities that come with having a luxurious life, as the author reflects on their experiences and thoughts after visiting Liapin's house, which made their own life seem "monstrously evil".
- The author notes that simply giving money to the poor is not a solution, as it does not address the root causes of poverty, and instead suggests that one must first reform their own mode of life before trying to reform others, citing the demands of taxes, rents, and other temptations that can lead to depravity.
- The author criticizes the wealthy for their extravagant lifestyle, including their love of fine clothes, luxurious dining, and large dwellings, which serve to separate them from the poor and perpetuate social inequality, and argues that the wealthy could easily help others if they were to simplify their lives and reduce their excesses.

- The author suggests that even small changes, such as wearing simpler clothes or eating with others, could help to reduce social inequality and promote a more compassionate society, and argues that the wealthy have a responsibility to use their resources to help others, rather than simply to indulge their own desires.

## The Influence of Augustine's Writings
- Ultimately, the author seems to be searching for a deeper understanding of morality, truth, and the human experience, and is drawn to the ideas and influences that resonate with their own existential questions and doubts.
- The section from the document '**JOURNAL314**' discusses the interpretation of Jesus' teachings, particularly in relation to the ideas of Tolstoy, and how his understanding may be influenced by his own nihilistic experiences, leading to a potentially flawed interpretation of the Gospel writings.
- The author references Tolstoy's interpretation of Jesus' doctrine, which emphasizes the importance of not resisting evil, and notes that both believers and unbelievers often fail to admit the simplicity and clarity of Jesus' words, as expressed in the Gospel writings.
- The author also references Matthew 7, which discusses the importance of laying up treasures in heaven rather than on earth, and the need to serve only one master, either God or money, highlighting the context of money in these teachings.
- The section touches on the idea that the true struggle is not against sin and immorality, but against nothingness and nihilism, and that salvation is needed from this emptiness, rather than from inevitable immorality, which is a concept that the author finds resonates with their own ideas, even before reading similar definitions from another author, referred to as Oo.
- The author expresses feelings of guilt about trying to improve their life, as this seems to go against the teachings of Jesus, Socrates, and Buddha, and questions whether this is too harsh or strict, ultimately concluding that they are not in a position to judge what is too strict or not.
- The final part of the section references the idea that coercion and violence are contrary to human nature, citing the example of a judge, clerk, or soldier who would not willingly carry out violent acts without being hardened by discipline or service, highlighting the inherent contradiction between human nature and the mechanisms of institutions based on coercion.
- The administrative machinery of society allows individuals to avoid feeling responsible for the harm caused by their actions, as noted in the context of the document titled 'JOURNAL314', which explores the concept of existence and the doctrine of Jesus.
- The doctrine of Jesus is seen as a conviction that the existence organized by humans is a vanity and a delirium of folly, and that true happiness cannot be found in personal life, but rather in following the doctrine of Jesus, as discussed in Chapter 8 of 'My Religion'.
- The Nihilistic experience is acknowledged as a reality, not a delusion or mental illness, and it is emphasized that a man has no inherent rights, but rather obligations to others for the good he has received, as highlighted in Chapter 9 of 'My Religion'.

## The Critique of Worldly Attachments
- Jesus' teachings emphasize the importance of having faith in truth, rather than in his person, and that labor is an inevitable condition of human life, with food being the inevitable consequence of labor, which is a concept that may be agreed upon by Naturalists.
- The quotes from 'My Religion' highlight the conflict between the doctrine of Jesus and the doctrine of the world, with the latter promoting the accumulation of wealth and material possessions, while the former advocates for a simpler life and a focus on helping others, as seen in the contrast between the two doctrines.
- The text also critiques the societal emphasis on competition, wages, and material possessions, suggesting that this approach to life is misguided and ultimately leads to suffering, as individuals strive to accumulate more and more, only to fall ill and die from overwork, as described in the passage from 'My Religion'.
- The author encourages readers to understand the doctrine of Jesus and to have faith in truth, rather than blindly following the doctrine of the world, and to read all of Chapter 10 in 'My Religion' to gain a deeper understanding of these concepts, as the document 'JOURNAL314' explores the complexities of human existence and the search for meaning.
- The concept of evolution has led humans to focus primarily on food and survival, but this has also resulted in a lack of suffering for the sake of spiritual or religious beliefs, as evident in the fact that millions have perished in wars and social systems based on worldly doctrines, yet few have suffered or died for the doctrine of Jesus.
- The Bible is not considered a direct revelation from God, but rather a book that depicts humans struggling with their understanding of God, and as such, it is still worth studying as a Wisdom tradition.
- The teachings of Jesus, as recorded in Matthew 6, emphasize the importance of practicing righteousness and giving to the needy in secret, without seeking praise or recognition from others, and instead, seeking reward from God who sees in secret.
- Jesus' teachings, as understood by Tolstoy, are not about following him as a person, but rather about embracing his conceptions and Truth, which is a common theme among spiritual leaders, including Buddha, who also left his family and questioned the religious practices of his time.
- The story of Buddha's life, as mentioned in the text, highlights his desire to seek wisdom and escape the cycle of suffering, despite the opposition and grief it caused his family and community, and this is similar to the experiences of Jesus and Socrates, who also left their families and challenged the norms of their time.
- The text suggests that true spiritual seeking and the pursuit of wisdom are not limited by time or circumstances, and that it is always the right time to seek religion and escape the impermanence and suffering of the world, as emphasized by Buddha's determination to seek wisdom and enlightenment.

## The Concept of the Mystical Experience
- The author of the **JOURNAL314** document is grappling with the concept of Plato's Forms and the idea of a higher, contemplative world, as influenced by thinkers such as Aquinas and Augustine, who devalue the active world in comparison to the contemplative world.
- The author explores the idea that devaluing the earthly realm can lead to a set of non-movement or peaceful actions, and discusses the concept of time, citing the arguments of Craig and the misunderstanding of Carl Sagan regarding the Moral Argument for God's existence.
- The author critiques Sagan's views on religious experiences and the interpretation of suffering, suggesting that if one values God above all else, then suffering would not be seen as evil, and that rationality must be circular or pragmatic in its justification.
- The author also discusses the concept of the Moral Law, suggesting that it cannot be about pain, punishment, or happiness, but rather about the contemplation of God, and that it escapes all earthly morality and concerns.
- The author touches on the idea that Naturalistic answers to death and coping with death are bankrupt, and that the tension of Nihilism can only be escaped by experiencing the terror of existence and acknowledging the existence of a higher power or God.
- The author references the ontological argument, but suggests that it does not go far enough, and that Nihilism must be compatible with the concept of God, highlighting the complexity and mystery of this idea.
- Throughout the document, the author references various thinkers, including Plato, Aquinas, Augustine, Craig, and C.S. Lewis, and grapples with the idea of balancing earthly concerns with a higher, contemplative reality.
- The concept of Nihiltheism is discussed as a religious experience of Nothingness, which is distinct from the Naturalist perspective of worshiping nothing, and is instead focused on the ideas of various philosophers and religious figures such as Tolstoy, Jesus, Socrates, Buddha, Pascal, Nietzsche, William James, Augustine, Cioran, Ligoti, Luther, Seraphim, Spong, and Hick.
- This Nihilistic experience is said to lead a person to the Other, rather than the Human, allowing for a disconnect from human values and a promotion of non-movement, as exemplified by the concept of a monk.
- The author criticizes Terence McKenna for being stuck in human values, but wonders if he finally experienced a lack of all meaning, and notes that God does not bring relief or put meaning back into the human realm, but rather inspires fear that leads to preparation for one's own death.

## The Importance of Contemplation and Solitude
- The author interprets Jesus as an example of someone who experienced the death and Nihilism of every action and thought, leading to his moral precepts, which are seen as a theory of non-movement, devaluation of the human realm, and contemplation of God as the only true reality.
- The author also explores the idea that all actions, including sexual relations, are morally equivalent and that the pleasure of knowing nothing is wrong is distinct from enjoying sin, as discussed by Augustine.
- The author reflects on their own experiences and interests, including reading about drug stories and atheism, and notes that Nihiltheism is the underlying theme that connects these topics, and that God is Nothing, leaving the individual alone with themselves and the infinite.
- The author expresses a desire to pursue God and test themselves in their own home, rather than joining a monastery, and distinguishes between seeking God and seeking personal peace, recognizing that these are two different ends.
- The author describes a personal experience on August 27th, in which they experienced something Other, characterized by understanding, mystery, and humility, and notes that this experience has defeated their previous Naturalist perspective and left them with a newfound appreciation for the music of Bach, which is seen as a manifestation of God's language.
- The concept of Nihiltheism is explored through the ideas of various philosophers and thinkers, including Plato, Socrates, Tolstoy, Nietzsche, Augustine, and others, who all seem to convey the message that one should not value this world and that morality is a human convention that detracts from the pursuit of God.
- The Nihilistic morality is described as a morality of non-movement, similar to the Taoist concept, where there is compassion and empathy, but no attempt to eliminate suffering or calculate actions to determine right or wrong, as these concepts are deemed to be irrelevant in the earthly realm.
- The idea is that true contentment cannot be found in the earthly realm, and that any set of beliefs that does not renounce the earthly as inferior cannot be considered "right", with the only concern being the pursuit of God and the perfection that is God.
- The thinkers mentioned, including Plato, Augustine, and others, all seem to point to the idea that God, or the Absolute, is the ultimate reality that should be striven for, and that the earthly realm is meaningless in comparison, with the fear of God being a real and respectable concept.
- The author also touches on the idea that certain experiences, such as those induced by the use of mushrooms, can bring individuals to a deeper understanding of the Nihilistic morality and the pursuit of God, and that music, particularly the music of Bach, can be a language of God that transcends earthly concerns.

## The Influence of Various Philosophical and Religious Concepts
- The author critiques Buddhism for its attempts to calculate suffering and make moral judgments based on earthly concerns, arguing that this approach is inconsistent with the Nihilistic morality, and instead praises the Taoist approach for its stoic and nihilistic nature, which renounces the earthly realm and seeks to understand the absolute.
- The concept of God is described as the "Nothing" that brings all these thinkers together in a common mode of thought, and the author emphasizes the importance of humility and respect in the presence of God, as well as the need to prepare for one's death and strive for moral perfection.
- The Buddhist approach to morality is distinct from the Nihilist ethics of non-movement and complete concern for God, as it does not involve a complete renunciation of the earthly realm, but rather a focus on the infinite and the eternal that lies within us, as expressed by Augustine, who emphasizes the importance of focusing on God rather than the earthly world.
- According to the text, God is the eternal that we have inside us, and we were "made in God's image" because of our capacity to transcend to the Other Realm, which is a realm that can be experienced during our earthly life, and if one has not been in this realm, they cannot possibly reason their way to God.
- The text criticizes the philosopher who becomes caught up in calculations and rationality without considering God, and instead emphasizes the importance of faith in God, the infinite, rather than earthly dogmas and doctrines, as reason alone is not sufficient to understand the truth, which is God.
- The text also references the ideas of Nietzsche, who had a Nihilistic experience that led him to erase all morality, but ultimately crumbled because he had no sense of the divine or the human connection to it, and instead constructed another earthly code of ethics that he realized was meaningless.
- The text argues that life is not inherently good, and that optimism can be a poison that creates distractions and keeps us from preparing for death and God, and instead proposes a negative morality of non-movement, where all pursuits must be for God, and contemplation and complete pacifism result.
- The concept of Nihiltheism is introduced, which involves the erasure of all earthly values, making all movements absurd, and bringing us to the Other Realm, where God is the nihilism that leads us to the Other, and all pursuits must now be for God, if not concerning God directly.
- The text concludes that reason leads to nothing, and that God is nothing, but that reason does not contradict faith in God, and instead, the assumptions of Naturalism are pulled out from under us when we take away God, the foundation of everything, and that reason shows us that Naturalism is absurd, which leads us to another realm, and ultimately to God, as expressed by Jesus, who said that he is the light, the way, and that no one can get to God but through him.
- The author of the section from the document titled '**JOURNAL314**' discusses the concept of Nihilism and its connection to the Divine, suggesting that a person who grasps the concepts of Nihilism, such as Jesus, can have sincere connections with the Divine.

## The Concept of Nihiltheism and Its Relation to Christianity
- The author argues that the principles of Nihilism, such as turning the other cheek, giving up earthly possessions, and letting go of ego and material things, are similar to the teachings of Jesus, particularly in the Sermon on the Mount, and that this devaluation of the earthly realm leads to a state of total pacifism and non-movement.
- The author believes that the purpose of life is to prepare for death and the true, other realm, and that this preparation involves embracing Nihilism and letting go of earthly attachments, rather than following traditional Christian doctrines or pursuing material success.
- The author suggests that God is not a religious concept, but rather a representation of Nihilism, and that the doctrines of Christianity need to fall away in order to defeat Naturalism and understand the true nature of existence.

- The author concludes that Nihilism is the key to understanding the mystery of existence, and that it is the only thing that can make sense in a world where reason leads to skepticism and despair, and that God, or the Other, is the ultimate reality that provides the answer to the questions posed by Nihilism.
- The author also mentions the philosopher Plantinga, who argued that Naturalism is self-defeating, and suggests that God, or the Other, is the only thing that can provide a sense of certainty and meaning in a seemingly absurd and nihilistic world.
- The text appears to be a section from the document '**JOURNAL314**', which discusses various themes and concepts related to the Tao, Christianity, and philosophical ideas, highlighting the contradictory nature of the Tao and its similarities with Christian teachings.
- The author references specific chapters from the Daodejing, such as chapters 14, 16, 20, 22, 24, 25, 29, 31, 37, 38, 41, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 63, 69, 70, 72, 75, 76, 80, and 81, to illustrate the principles of non-movement, non-violence, simplicity, and humility.
- The text also mentions the ideas of William Lane Craig, specifically his work "The Problem of Religious Diversity", where he argues that the presence of multiple, incompatible religious truth claims does not necessarily imply that none of them are objectively true, and that the Christian worldview could still be objectively true.
- The author criticizes Craig's approach, suggesting that it is a "skeptical" nature or a form of "guilt by association" used to justify Christian ideas, and that his paper "Politically Incorrect Salvation" is unconvincing and creates possibilities to objections in order to show that his view is not necessarily contradictory.

## The Critique of Earthly Concerns and the Importance of Seeking God
- The text concludes by stating that religious pluralism must be true, as quarrels between religions about God are always rooted in earthly concerns, and that historical, cultural, and linguistic influences limit our conceptions and experiences of the divine.
- The author seems to be questioning the value of philosophical debates and the importance of earthly concerns, suggesting that they can be a hindrance to understanding the Tao and the nature of the divine.
- The concept of Nihilism is discussed in relation to Earthly concerns and doctrines, suggesting that they may be flawed due to their human origins, and that the core concepts of Nihilism, such as non-movement and the denouncement of the Earthly, can lead to a full embrace of a higher power or God, making suffering and pain no longer issues of concern.
- The idea of religious pluralism is introduced through the analogy of three blind men describing an elephant, highlighting that each person's description may be accurate yet limited, and that this concept is comparable to the diverse language used to describe the core idea of distance from God or a higher power.
- The Nihilistic experience is compared to the Dao, God, the Infinite, and the Transcendent, and is characterized by quietism and non-resistance, with examples from various philosophers and theologians, including Meister Eckhart, who stated that only those who recognize the nothingness of all creatures can truly know God.
- The views of Meister Eckhart are compared to those of Indian, Christian, and Islamic mystics and ascetics by Schopenhauer, who notes that despite differences in expression, they teach essentially the same thing, emphasizing the importance of turning away from the finite and earthly realm to prepare for a higher power or God.
- The concept of sin is discussed in relation to finiteness and the free will of the creature, with the idea that preoccupation with the earthly realm and failure to prepare for a higher power or God constitutes sin, and that inner separation from earthly concerns and yielding to a higher power is necessary for spiritual growth.
- The ideas of John Shelby Spong are introduced, who speaks of Jesus as a human reflecting the values of God and emphasizes the importance of embracing humanity and the human condition, which is seen as a form of Nihilism, and is criticized for his views, drawing comparisons to the treatment of Socrates.
- The summary concludes with a reference to Eugene Rose, who questions the concept of the god of the Nihilist, highlighting the complexities and nuances of Nihilistic thought and its relationship to spirituality and the human condition.
- The concept of Nihilism is discussed as a state of nothingness, where there is no point of orientation, and no distinction between right and wrong, true and false, as described in the context of the "JOURNAL314" document.

## The Concept of Quietism and Its Relation to Nihilism
- The Nihilistic experience is not limited to a Naturalist or Atheistic universe, but can also be found in a universe with God, and is considered a path to the Absolute, with the idea that the Nihilist may be speaking the ultimate language as God.
- The author disagrees with Rose's interpretation of Nihilism, stating that non-movement is the essence of Nihilism, as God is found within it, and that Nihilism is Eternal, Absolute, and Infinite, and cannot be truly described using language from the Earthly realm.
- The text also critiques the transformation of the Christian tradition into a system for promoting worldly progress, and the consequences of Nihilism, including the idea that if there is no truth, power knows no limit, and that the pursuit of freedom and human values as a replacement for God is a complete failure.
- The author discusses Nietzsche's understanding of Nihilism, stating that he failed to grasp its ultimate meaning because he attempted to construct an Earthly philosophy around the Other realm, and that Nietzsche's idea of Nihilism as a sign of mankind's growth is correct, but only in the sense that it helps us transition into the Other realm.
- The text concludes by highlighting the importance of experiencing Nihilism in order to find new values, and that the pursuit of values and ideals without God is a war against God with His own gifts, emphasizing the idea that Nihilism is a necessary step towards understanding the true value of values and the nature of existence.
- The concept of Nihilism is discussed in relation to the Christian faith, where a Christian can be seen as a Nihilist, rejecting all modern values and believing that the goods of this world are nothing in comparison to God, as stated in the document 'JOURNAL314'.
- The idea of True Nihilism is explored, which wipes out the Earthly realm but not the Other realm, and is seen as a means to understand the absence of God, with the philosopher Seraphim Rose noting that only those who fully believe in Heaven and life in God can fully believe in Hell.
- The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche is quoted, stating that if God is dead and there is no immortality, then this world is all there is, and it is absurd, with no Objective Truth, and that Nihilism, as the denial of a truthful world, might be a divine way of thinking.
- Nietzsche also expresses scorn for ideals and the concept of "idealism", and argues that those who reject traditional morality, including himself, are the strongest power in the world, having transferred the concept of the "chandala" to those who teach a beyond, including priests and Christians.
- Seraphim Rose is also quoted, stating that men learn through pain and suffering, rather than pleasure and happiness, because pain and suffering drive one to seek a more profound happiness beyond the limitations of this world, and that everything in this life passes away, except for God, who is worth struggling towards.

## The Influence of Michael de Molinos' Writings
- The text also references the idea that psychedelics and other forms of consciousness may have helped individuals understand the concept of a "True World", and that having the universe crumble around them can provide a reason to believe in such a world, highlighting the complex and nuanced discussion of Nihilism and its relationship to the divine in the document 'JOURNAL314'.
- The text from the **JOURNAL314** document explores the concept of Nihilism and its relationship with the human experience of God, citing quotes from various spiritual leaders such as Seraphim Rose and Thomas Merton to emphasize the importance of embracing the darkness and nothingness within oneself to find the mercy of God.
- The author critiques traditional Christian theology, particularly the idea that Jesus died for humanity's sins, and instead suggests that the true meaning of Jesus' death and resurrection is a mythical representation of the Nihilistic experience, which allows individuals to connect with the divine and transcend earthly concerns.
- The text highlights the significance of the Nihilistic experience as a universal human condition, which is reflected in various religious traditions, and argues that focusing on Nihilism itself can lead to a deeper understanding of God and the contemplative life.
- The author references the Hesychast tradition and the concept of experiential knowledge of God, emphasizing the importance of solitude, intuition, and the balance between rational thinking and mystical experience in achieving a deeper understanding of the divine.
- The text concludes by emphasizing the need for a theology that is shaped by the Nihilistic experience, rather than being bogged down in earthly concerns, and highlights the importance of pluralism and the shared message found in the teachings of various spiritual leaders, including Jesus, Buddha, Socrates, Tolstoy, Nietzsche, and others.
- The author encourages individuals to embrace the Nihilistic experience and to focus on the "Nothing" as a means of discovering God, and to approach the contemplative life with an open and intuitive mindset, unencumbered by earthly distractions.
- Theology should not be overly focused on earthly movements and concerns, as these are not relevant to God, and instead, one's ultimate end should be the primary concern, with the details of human power, morality, and mythology being secondary.
- The experience of nihilism, as exemplified by Bach's music, can be a powerful tool for connecting with God's reality, and combining meditation, contemplation, and psychedelic experiences can help to open oneself up to this reality.
- The interpretation of God fits together with the experience of nihilism, and religions that focus on earthly concerns cannot be correct, as humans have a transcendent reality that is eternal, immaterial, and indestructible.

## The Importance of Embracing Nothingness and Misery
- The concept of conversion, as described by Seraphim Rose, involves a process of revelation that occurs when a person is in need and suffering, and God reveals Himself and shows the way out of this suffering.
- The idea of salvation or justification through faith alone, as conceived by Martin Luther, is more in line with the nihilistic experience, and works or morality should not be the primary concern, as they can distract from the ultimate end of God.
- Luther's conception of faith coheres with non-movement and the nihilistic experience, as actions and works can lead to absurdities and distractions from the ultimate end, and instead, one should focus on the inner concerns of man and the experience of suffering as a path to God.
- The combination of nihilism and theism, referred to as "Nihiltheism", can be a meeting point for all religions, including Christianity, Naturalism, Atheism, and Taoism, and allows for a proper interpretation of divine messages within these religions.
- The writings of Augustine and Luther, such as Augustine's Confessions and Luther's Freedom of a Christian, provide insight into the nihilistic experience and the concept of faith, and demonstrate that Christianity is not the only way to understand the divine message, but rather one of many possible interpretations.
- The concept of Religious Pluralism is associated with the idea that human interpretations of God are inherently flawed and cannot fully encompass the divine, leading to conflicting earthly theologies that are not truly representative of God.
- The experience of Nihilism is considered to be a more authentic and direct experience of God, with the idea that true happiness is not of this earth and that earthly pursuits of happiness are ultimately meaningless.
- The writer references historical figures such as Martin Luther, who underwent a conversion experience characterized by terror, agony, and despair, leading him to renounce the earthly realm and emphasize the importance of faith alone, not works, in achieving salvation.
- The writer also quotes philosophers and theologians such as Gödel, Augustine, and Plato, who discuss the limitations of the human mind and the finite nature of human understanding in relation to the infinite and unchangeable nature of truth.
- Augustine's Confessions are cited extensively, with quotes discussing the perversion of the will, the corruption of the body and its impact on the soul, and the desire to seek the unchangeable and eternal over the changeable and earthly.

- Augustine comes to fear being denied by Christ if he does not confess him before men, and he realizes that there is no salvation in the rhetoric he teaches, prompting him to consider naming God's Word before others, despite potential criticism, as discussed on page 112.
- The text also touches on the idea that greater joy is often preceded by greater pain, similar to Nietzsche's phrase "whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger," and that God is always present, but humans have difficulty returning to him, as mentioned on pages 113-114.
- Augustine reflects on how God chooses the weak and base things of the world to confound the strong, as stated in 1 Corinthians 1:27-28, and how he is torn between his old and new wills, the carnal and spiritual, which are in conflict within him, as described on page 115.

## The Critique of External Works and the Importance of Internal Recollection
- The concept of double-mindedness and the divided self is also explored, as Augustine struggles with his natural and spiritual desires, and he comes to understand the discord between his flesh and spirit, as mentioned on page 115, where he quotes how "the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh."
- The narrator of the JOURNAL314 document is reflecting on their past struggles with habit and desire, noting that they had become an enemy to themselves by willingly embracing habits that they knew were harmful, and that their perception of the truth had become certain, yet they still refused to serve God.
- The narrator describes themselves as being "sweetly burdened" with the world's distractions, and that their thoughts about God were like attempts to wake up from a deep slumber, but they were still overpowered by their own desires and habits, which were driven by the "law of sin" and the "tyranny of habit".
- The narrator mentions the "slavery of worldly business" and how they were going about their daily affairs with increasing anxiety, while sighing and yearning for a deeper connection with God, and they note that true freedom and satisfaction can only be found in God's love.
- The narrator then shifts their focus to the story of a friend who had found a new path in life, inspired by the life of Anthony, a servant of God, and how this friend had been reading about Anthony's life and had become inflamed with a desire to give up his worldly employment and seek God alone.
- The friend, who was a "secret service agent", had been walking in a garden with a companion when they stumbled upon a cottage where some of God's servants lived, and there they found the book about Anthony's life, which sparked a deep transformation in the friend, as he began to question the goals and motivations of his life and ultimately resolved to become a "friend of God".
- The narrator notes that this friend's transformation was sudden and profound, and that he was inwardly changed as he read about Anthony's life, and that the world "dropped away from his mind" as he turned his eyes towards God, and that this change became plain to others as he groaned and struggled with the travail of his new life.
- The text from the document '**JOURNAL314**' describes a scene where two friends decide to dedicate their lives to serving God, with one of them saying "Now I have broken loose from those hopes we had, and I am determined to serve God; and I enter into that service from this hour in this place."
- The friends, who had been bound by their hopes and worldly desires, begin to "build a tower" by counting the cost of forsaking all they had and following God, and they ask their friends Ponticianus and his companion not to oppose them if they refuse to join.

- The text also touches on the concept of sin and the human condition, using the language of Adam and Eve, and describes the "dark labyrinth of human punishment" and the struggle with nihilism.
- The narrator explores the idea of the mind commanding itself and the anomaly of the will, where the mind commands itself to will, but does not obey itself, and concludes that this is an infirmity of the mind that cannot wholly rise due to habit, even when supported by the truth.
- The text from the document titled '**JOURNAL314**' discusses the concept of two wills, where one will is not whole and lacks what the other will has, leading to a divided mind when making decisions, as explained by the author who is reflecting on the writings of Augustine.
- The author notes that when faced with multiple good options, such as reading the apostle, delighting in a sober psalm, or discoursing on the gospel, the mind is distracted by different wills, but once a choice is made, the whole united will can move forward on a single track.
- The author also reflects on the struggle between eternity and earthly delights, where the soul is pulled apart by grievous perplexities, and notes that this struggle is a contest of self against self, as the soul prefers truth for its own sake but is held back by custom.
- The author recalls the story of Anthony, who was converted to God after hearing the gospel being read in church, and wonders why it was so easy for Anthony to make this conversion, while also referencing Augustine's experiences and writings.
- The author expresses their own experience of working on a theology and discovering Augustine's views, including his conception of "evil" as not existing as a thing in itself, but rather as a lack of existence, which makes sense in the context of a Nihilistic experience of God and the devaluation of the earthly world.
- The author praises Augustine's views as true and insightful, and criticizes philosophy and education for not introducing them to Augustine's work sooner, highlighting the importance of Augustine's Book Eight of the Confessions.

## The Importance of Enduring Trials and Tribulations
- The author concludes by noting that Augustine's conception of "evil" and the lack of an earthly moral ontology leads to a striving towards a complete submersion into God, and expresses a sense of joy and triumph in their own conversion, similar to the experience of Augustine and his mother.
- The concept of the "Good" is considered Platonic, rather than earthly, and is discussed in the context of the Perennial Philosophy, which involves deep analytical thought and the potential for a Nihilistic experience through the use of particular substances.
- According to Aldous Huxley, as quoted from his book "The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell", the human brain and nervous system function to protect individuals from being overwhelmed by the vast amount of knowledge and perceptions that are available, by filtering out most of what is not practically useful.
- Huxley also discusses the idea of "Zen Sickness", or a mental breakdown, which can be related to Nihilism, and the concept of the "active-contemplative", who is able to balance contemplation with action, as exemplified by the phrase "coming down from the seventh heaven to bring a cup of water to his sick brother".
- The text touches on the idea that contemplation, even in its most quietistic forms, has ethical values, and that refraining from doing harm is an important aspect of morality, as noted by Pascal, who said that the sum of evil would be greatly diminished if people could only learn to sit quietly in their rooms.
- Huxley's work is also referenced in discussions of the search for meaning and the potential for Nihilism, with quotes such as "this suffocating interior of a dime-store ship was my own personal self" highlighting the feeling of emptiness and meaninglessness that can arise from a contemplative experience.
- The text also mentions the historical context of world denial and condemnation, citing the phrase "we should feel wonder at nothing at all in Nature except only the Incarnation of Christ" from the seventeenth century, which is noted to have seemed sensible at the time but now appears to be madness.
- Additionally, Huxley's thoughts on art and music are referenced, including the idea that the retreat from the external world has not been into a deeper, inner divine realm, but rather into a more squalid and closed personal subconscious, and that music can be disorganized and yet still be meaningful.
- The text concludes with a quote from Huxley on music, stating that "it does not matter that he's all in bits, the whole is disorganized", highlighting the complex and often contradictory nature of human experience and perception.
- The concept of disintegration and chaos is discussed, where individual fragments can still represent a Higher Order, and the totality is present even in broken pieces, allowing for a more immediate perception of the ultimate order.

## The Concept of the Mystical Death and the Importance of Resignation
- The music of Bach is highlighted as a means to navigate this chaos, as his notes speak directly to the listener and provide a sense of structure and language that is fluent and unobscured, unlike other composers such as Handel, Scarlatti, and Telemann.
- The idea of ego disintegration is explored, where the body can look after itself, but the mind may struggle to cope with the intensity of reality, leading to feelings of panic and fear, as described by Aldous Huxley in his experiences with mescaline.
- Huxley's experiences are compared to those of schizophrenic individuals, who are unable to shut off the experience of reality and are scared by its strangeness and intensity, leading them to interpret it as malevolent and prompting desperate countermeasures.
- The importance of fixing one's attention on the Clear Light, as described in The Tibetan Book of the Dead, is mentioned as a potential means to keep the evil away and navigate the challenges of ego disintegration and the experience of intense reality.
- The text also touches on the idea that the divine Light can be apprehended as a burning, purgatorial fire by unregenerate souls, and that the schizophrenic individual is like a person permanently under the influence of mescaline, unable to escape the experience of reality and struggling to cope with its intensity.
- The text from the document '**JOURNAL314**' discusses the concept of remaining undistracted and focused on the present moment, citing the Tibetan ritual and the importance of having a guide to navigate through challenging experiences, as mentioned by Bach, who notes that one cannot do it by oneself.
- The author reflects on the idea of staying grounded and connected to a higher power, referencing Taoism and the concept of letting go, and also mentions the work of Aldous Huxley, who suggests that modern psychiatrists could learn from Buddhist monks in providing comfort and reassurance to the dying and the insane.
- Huxley's idea is applied by the author to their own experience with the music of Bach, which serves as a reminder of the ultimate Reality and the inner light that remains unshakably itself, even in the midst of turmoil, and the author notes that this experience is both abstract and absolute.
- The text also explores the concept of repentance and the recognition of one's own worthlessness in isolation from others and God, citing the importance of serving others and acquiring the means of living through struggle with nature.
- The author references various philosophers and theologians, including Rose, Spong, and Nietzsche, who discuss the idea that embracing insecurity and uncertainty can be a sign of growth and a transition into new conditions of existence, and notes that few have had the curiosity to explore this idea, asking how many philosophers, theologians, and educators have opened the "Door in the Wall" to new understanding and experience.

## The Influence of Various Spiritual Leaders and Their Writings
- The text from the document "**JOURNAL314**" discusses the concept of transcendence and the human experience, referencing Aldous Huxley's work "The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell", which explores the idea that reality is an infinite and complex entity that can be directly apprehended and experienced.
- According to Huxley, being enlightened means being aware of total reality in its immanent otherness, while still being able to survive and function as a human being, and that this awareness can be facilitated by experiences that transcend the ordinary, such as those induced by chemicals or other means.
- The text also references the idea that every individual, or "Angel" in Blake's sense, should be permitted to experience transcendental states, even if they are fleeting or terrifying, as this can lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the world.
- The example of Thomas Aquinas is given, who after receiving a revelation, considered all his previous writings to be insignificant, illustrating the profound impact that such experiences can have on one's perspective and understanding.
- The concept of "Infused Contemplation" is mentioned, which refers to the ability to see the world in a new and profound way, and an example is given of a person who, while sitting on a seashore, suddenly saw the exquisite beauty of a film of sand on their hand, and realized that the whole universe is made up of particles filled with intense and vital beauty.
- This experience is described as a "transfiguration of the everyday world", where the ordinary becomes extraordinary, and the individual is left with a profound sense of wonder and appreciation for the beauty locked up in every minute speck of material around them, as described by Aldous Huxley.
- The text discusses the concept of Nihilism and its relationship to the religious experience, citing Aldous Huxley's work "The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell" as a reference point, where Huxley describes the experience of Nihilism as potentially distressing but also salutary.
- The author reflects on the idea that not many people will be able to truly understand and walk the path of the "Other world", and that even Christians may be led astray and stuck in the earthly realm, highlighting the importance of suspecting one's surroundings and cohorts.
- The text also explores the connection between Nihilism and Quietism, suggesting that Quietism is a characteristic of certain religions, such as Pantheistic Brahmanism and Buddhism, which aim to achieve a state of self-annihilation and imperturbable tranquillity through the recognition of one's identity with a higher power.
- The author notes that the connections between different worldviews and experiences point to a negative, non-movement, and quietism, renouncement of the earthly, while attempting to contemplate the "Other" and achieve a union of Self and Other, not in the earthly sense, but in a more spiritual and immaterial sense.

## The Concept of the Perennial Philosophy and Its Relation to Spiritual Reflection
- The concept of Quietism is further explained through a quote from the Catholic Encyclopedia New Advent, which describes it as a craving for deliverance and peace that can be obtained by withdrawing from action and external dependencies and immersing oneself in the Divine being, which is seen as a decent description of some of the conclusions one receives from the Nihilistic experience.
- The author mentions that Jesus and Augustine are relevant figures in this context, with Jesus being right that not many will be able to walk the path, and Augustine's thoughts on the popularity of Christianity being potentially misguided, and the author's mother being someone who would understand these concepts more intuitively.
- The text concludes by highlighting the importance of understanding the connections between different philosophical and religious concepts, and how they can inform and enrich one's understanding of the human experience, particularly in relation to the concept of Nihilism and the search for a deeper, more spiritual connection with the "Other".
- The connection being discussed seems very strong and "right", and it is related to the concept of Quietism, which was developed by Michael de Molinos, a Spanish theologian, in the strictest sense of the term.
- Michael de Molinos' writings, particularly his book "Dux spiritualis" published in Rome in 1675, were extracted into sixty-eight propositions that were later condemned by Innocent XI in 1687, as documented in Denzinger-Bannwart.
- The key principle of Quietism, as outlined by Michael de Molinos, is that man must annihilate his powers and abandon himself entirely to God, remaining as a lifeless body, and by doing so, the soul annihilates itself and returns to its source, the essence of God, where it is transformed and divinized.
- In this inward way, the soul should not think of reward or punishment, heaven or hell, death or eternity, and it must not concern itself with its own state, defects, or progress in virtue, but rather let God work out His will without any action from the soul itself.
- According to Michael de Molinos, one who has committed themselves entirely to God should not ask anything of God, render thanks to Him, take account of temptations, or offer any active resistance, and should permit nature to stir without interference.
- In prayer, one must remain in "obscure faith" and quiet, forgetting every distinct thought of the Divine attributes, and abide in God's presence to adore, love, and serve Him without producing any acts, as these are not pleasing to God.
- Michael de Molinos also believed that sensible devotion is not a genuine pursuit of God, but rather a seeking of oneself, and that every sensible effect experienced in the spiritual life is abominable and unclean.

## The Importance of Seeking God with Truth and Humility
- Additionally, he argued that no preparation is required before Communion, nor thanksgiving after, other than the soul remaining in its usual state of passive resignation, and that the soul must not endeavour to arouse feelings of devotion.
- Furthermore, Michael de Molinos taught that interior souls should resign themselves to God in silence, and that the more thorough their resignation, the more they realize their inability to recite even the "Pater Noster", and that they should not elicit acts of love for the Blessed Virgin, the saints, or the Humanity of Christ, as these are sensible objects.
- Finally, Michael de Molinos believed that external works are not necessary for sanctification, and that penitential works, such as voluntary mortification, should be cast off as a grievous and useless burden, and that when faced with demonic onsets, one must make no effort to resist, but rather let the demon have its way, setting aside scruples and doubts.
- The text from the document "**JOURNAL314**" discusses the concept of the "inward way" which is a path to spiritual perfection that has nothing to do with confession, confessors, cases of conscience, theology, or philosophy, and is instead focused on achieving a state of imperturbable peace and union with God.
- According to the text, God sometimes makes it impossible for souls who are advanced in perfection to go to confession, and instead supplies them with grace, leading to a state where passion is extinguished, sin is no more, and the soul wills only what God wills, which is referred to as the "mystic death".
- The text also mentions that those who pursue this path must obey their superiors outwardly, but only God and the director enter into the soul's interior, and that the Church passes no judgment on the hidden things of the interior life.
- The concept of Quietism is mentioned as a result of Nihilism, and is found in various philosophical and religious traditions, including Luther's Reformation, Buddhist Nirvana, and the works of Eckhart, Aquinas, and Augustine.
- The text quotes Molinos, who writes about the importance of experimental guidance and true subjection and submission in order to ascend to a higher state of spiritual awareness, and emphasizes the need to understand and know God through an obscure, general, and confused faith, rather than through distinct and clear intellectual understanding.
- Molinos also writes about the importance of acknowledging and embracing one's own nothingness and misery as a means of achieving spiritual reform and union with God, and encourages the soul to clothe itself in this nothingness and misery in order to receive the Lord's wonders and achieve the greatest good and highest peace.
- The pursuit of spiritual perfection involves mortifying one's passions, denying oneself, and recognizing one's own nothingness, which can ultimately lead to a state of quiet contemplation, divine wisdom, and true knowledge with the aid of a higher power.

## The Concept of the Painful Martyrdom of Desolation and Passive Purgation
- Many individuals fail to achieve this state due to their inability to fully submit themselves to a higher power, deny their own desires, and conquer their own selves, which is necessary for purification and transformation through inward pain.
- The concept of nothingness is a central theme in spiritual growth, where recognizing one's own worthlessness and powerlessness can help individuals endure spiritual hardships and ultimately die to their own selves, allowing for a deeper understanding and connection with a higher power.
- There are two extreme views: Essentialism, which believes in the inherent existence of things, and Nihilism, which believes that there is no need for responsibility, but the Middle way, as represented by Madhyamaka, offers a balanced approach between these two extremes.
- The concept of Buddha nature, or the inherent potential for enlightenment, is present in every being and can be accessed through various means such as meditation, contemplation, or prayer, allowing individuals to experience a state of nirvanic liberation and connect with their own inner awakeness.
- The Buddha nature is described as uncreated, deathless, and beyond rational understanding, and it is this internal element that guides individuals towards liberation from worldly suffering and ultimately leads them to a state of spotless bliss and transformation into a Buddha.
- The teachings of Mahayana metaphysics, particularly the concept of emptiness and Madhyamaka philosophy, provide a foundation for understanding the nature of reality and the path to enlightenment, which is characterized by the elimination of negative thoughts and behaviors, allowing the indwelling Buddha principle to shine forth and transform the individual.
- The language used to describe the concept of the Other is primarily negative, as it is incomprehensible, and the Buddha nature genre of sūtras attempts to express orthodox Buddhist teachings using positive language to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism due to a false impression of nihilism.
- The concept of nihilism is seen as a universal element that ties together various boundaries of concepts of the Other, which are restricted or destroyed by language, culture, intelligence, and religion, and is considered the root of perennial concepts such as non-movement, pacifism, and renouncement.
- The Pure Land school of Mahāyāna simplifies the expression of faith by allowing salvation to be obtained through the grace of the Other, which is similar to the concept of nihilism, and emphasizes the importance of humility, listening, and asking for help in order to be released into the Other realm.
- The idea of contemplating the Other with the hope of obtaining union with the Other realm is reflected in the works of various spiritual leaders, including Socrates, Jesus, and Molinos, who is referred to as a "Spiritual Genius" by William James in "The Varieties of Religious Experience".

## The Importance of Recognizing One's Own Nothingness and Misery
- Augustine's writings also touch on the concept of nihilism, stating that evil does not exist in a positive sense, but rather as the lack of goodness, and that Jesus was sent to show us to despise worldly things in order to gain immortality, highlighting the idea that goodness exists in the next realm, not in this world.
- The concept of nothingness is seen as a fundamental aspect of human experience, with our earthly languages and symbols failing to capture its essence, and is considered to be a universal experience that transcends time and culture, with only a few individuals being able to truly understand and experience it.
- The fear of nihilism is seen as a fear of God, and is considered to be a driving force behind human behavior, with people often ignoring or distracting themselves from the reality of their own annihilation, and the organized madness that surrounds us today is seen as a result of this distraction.
- The text from the document '**JOURNAL314**' discusses the concept of experiencing God and the difficulties of accepting a higher power due to earthly habits and selfish conceptions of a god, as noted by Augustine in his Confessions.
- Augustine's quotes, such as "I was mad for health, and dying for life" and "I hesitated to die to death and to live to life", highlight the struggles of letting go of earthly desires and embracing a spiritual life.
- The text also references the experiences of others, including a woman who committed suicide after an LSD experience, and Timothy Leary, who is described as being too earthly in his approach, as well as Molinos and his concept of infused contemplation.
- The Perennial Philosophy is mentioned as a framework for understanding spiritual reflection and the pursuit of knowledge, with references to philosophers such as Plato, Socrates, and Tolstoy, who all sought to understand reality and the human condition.
- The text quotes from various sources, including "The City of God" and "A Letter to a Hindu", to illustrate the idea that true understanding and happiness can only be achieved by letting go of earthly desires and embracing a life of solitude, humility, and internal retirement, as noted in quotes such as "If, with this liberty, thou wilt give thy Soul to God, taken off from the World, free and alone, thou wilt be the happiest creature upon Earth".
- The importance of humility and recognizing one's own nothingness is emphasized, as noted in the quote "Why, thinkest thou, do infinite Souls hinder the abundant Current of the divine gifts? 'Tis only because they would be doing something, and have a desire to be great: all this is to come away from internal Humility, and from their own Nothing".
- The text also touches on the idea that true spiritual growth and understanding can only be achieved by quieting the mind and listening to the divine voice, as noted in the quote "in this internal Retirement that that marvellous, powerful and divine Voice is heard".

## The Concept of the Inward Way and the Importance of Silence and Resignation
- The text from the **JOURNAL314** document discusses the importance of seeking God with truth and humility, and that those who do not do so will not find Him, as they must first undervalue their own selves and recognize their nothingness.
- It is stated that God's Omnipotence can produce wonders in the soul of an individual who keeps constant quiet, is resigned, and has a true knowledge of their nothingness, and that this can lead to a deeper understanding of one's purpose, value, and meaning.
- The text quotes various spiritual leaders, including St Teresa, who appeared after her death to a certain soul and told them that she had only been rewarded for her pain, not for the extasies and revelations she had experienced in life, highlighting the importance of suffering with quiet and resignation.
- The concept of a "painful martyrdom of horrible desolation and passive purgation" is discussed, which is described as a necessary step towards achieving the "sweet, joyous and abundant riches of high contemplation and loving union" with God, and is compared to a form of "Hell" by mystic divines, including Seraphim Rose.
- The text also references the ideas of Augustine, who said "die to live, live to die", emphasizing the need to endure spiritual martyrdom and painful torment in order to arrive at a state of union with God.
- It is noted that all those who serve the Lord must suffer troubles, persecutions, and tribulations, but that those guided by God through the interior walk and purgative contemplation must suffer even more, with stronger and more horrible temptations and torments than those experienced by martyrs in the primitive church.
- The text concludes by describing the desolate soul that must "die in itself" and put off its old heart, surrounded by temptations, darkness, and anguish, and that this state is a prolonged death and continual martyrdom, but that it is a necessary step towards achieving peace and resignation in following Christ.
- The Lord will not abandon individuals, even in times of great suffering, but the support provided will be so secret that it may seem like there is no remedy, leaving the soul feeling hopeless and without consolation, much like those who are condemned to suffer the pains of hell.
- There are four signs to recognize the inner man, which include: the understanding producing thoughts that stir up the light of faith, the will being habituated to acts of love for God, the ability to easily turn to God after ceasing from external work, and carrying oneself in an orderly manner towards outward things while abhorring business unless charity requires it.
- The understanding of mystical truths is a secret science known only to saints and those who humbly seek their own contempt, and individuals who live sensually according to flesh and blood are far from this mystical science, which allows the soul to dive into profound apprehensions of the divinity.

## The Influence of Augustine's Confessions and the Importance of Seeking God
- The sermons of men of learning who lack the spirit are not the word of God, but rather the word of men, and these preachers can spoil Christians by feeding them with empty and vain words, leaving both the preachers and their followers void of God.
- There are two ways to know God: speculation, which is a remote way, and contemplation, which is a near way, and while the learned may follow speculation to get to know God, only those who follow the mystical way of contemplation can arrive at the excellence of union, transformation, simplicity, light, peace, tranquility, and love.
- Study that is not ordered for God's glory alone can lead to hell, not through the study itself, but through the pride that it begets, and many people are miserable because their only study is to satisfy their curiosity, rather than seeking to know and love God, as emphasized in Matthew 6:25-34, where it is written that one should not take thought for their life, but rather trust in God's providence.
- The section from the document '**JOURNAL314**' emphasizes the importance of seeking the kingdom of God and his righteousness, as stated by the heavenly Father, who knows that all basic needs will be met, and therefore, one should not worry about what to eat, drink, or wear.
- It is advised to sell one's possessions, give alms, and provide for oneself a treasure in heaven that will not fail, as stated in Luke xii. 33-34, and to follow the path of discipleship by leaving behind worldly attachments, such as family, fields, or house, and taking up one's cross each day.
- The text also warns against laying up treasures on earth, where they can be destroyed or stolen, and instead encourages laying up treasures in heaven, where they will be safe, and notes that one's heart will be where their treasure is.
- It is stated that one cannot serve two masters, specifically God and money, and that judgment will be based on the judgment one pronounces, with the measure used being the same measure that will be used in return.
- The importance of self-reflection and removing one's own flaws before trying to correct others is emphasized, as well as the need to enter by the narrow gate that leads to life, rather than the wide gate that leads to destruction.
- The text also includes parables, such as the one about the wise man who built his house on the rock and the foolish man who built his house on the sand, to illustrate the importance of following the words of God and being prepared for challenges.
- Additionally, the section includes accounts of Jesus' interactions with his disciples, such as when he calmed the winds and sea, and reminded them to have faith and not be anxious about their basic needs, as their heavenly Father knows what they need.

## The Concept of the Two Wills and the Struggle Between the Carnal and Spiritual
- The overall message of the section is one of trust, faith, and devotion to God, and the importance of prioritizing spiritual treasures over worldly ones, as emphasized by Jesus' teachings and interactions with his disciples.
- The text from the '**JOURNAL314**' document emphasizes the importance of seeking the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and not being anxious about tomorrow, as each day has its own troubles, and God will provide for those who prioritize his kingdom.
- It also highlights the value of giving to the needy in secret, without seeking praise from others, and turning the other cheek when faced with evil, as well as having compassion for those who are harassed and helpless.
- The text quotes Jesus as saying that he has not come to bring peace to the earth, but rather a sword, which will set family members against each other, and that whoever loves their family more than him is not worthy of him.
- Jesus teaches that his true family consists of those who do the will of his Father in heaven, and that people must turn and become like children to enter the kingdom of heaven, where the humble are considered the greatest.
- The text also warns that it is difficult for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven, and that the love of money is the root of all evil, leading people to err from the faith and experience many sorrows.
- Additionally, Jesus says that those who leave behind their worldly possessions for his sake will receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal life, but many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.
- The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of contentment and godliness, and that having food and clothing is sufficient, as those who strive to be rich will fall into temptation and destruction.
- The text from the document '**JOURNAL314**' discusses the concept of despising worldly things to attain immortality, citing Augustine's words on the attractiveness of beautiful bodies, gold, silver, and other worldly honors, but emphasizing that these should not lead one to depart from God's law.
- The author reflects on how sin is committed when one becomes immoderately inclined towards lower goods, forsaking the better and higher things, including God, truth, and His law, and notes that even righteous individuals like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and David were judged unrighteous by silly men.

## The Importance of Focusing on the Kingdom of God and His Righteousness
- The text also touches on the idea that things that were once lawful can become unlawful over time, and the author expresses grief and darkness upon experiencing the death of a loved one, feeling that their life is now a horror because they are living "halved" without their companion.
- The author is reminded to praise God for physical objects that bring pleasure, but to turn their love back to the creator, and to sacrifice their own desires and imaginations to God in order to be re-created immortally.
- The text quotes Heidegger's phrase "Suddenly every vain hope became worthless to me" and the author's own realization that they had been barking against the fictions of carnal imaginations, rather than the Catholic faith, and that scripture passages can be resolved through spiritual interpretation.
- The author expresses a desire to cleave to God, having been freed from the "fast-sticking glue of death", and notes that the joy of a faithful hope lies beyond the vanity of worldly things, urging themselves to abandon worldly hopes and seek after God and the blessed life.
- Ultimately, the author acknowledges that worldly things have some sweetness, but recognizes the importance of seeking a higher purpose and converting to God, who is above all and without whom all things would be nothing.
- The author of the Journal314 reflects on their life, realizing they were stuck in a state of pleasure and greed, and that this was distracting their soul and preventing them from enjoying a peaceful life with God.
- The author describes being guided by God to enter into their inward soul, where they discovered that iniquity is a perversion of the will, turned away from God towards lower things, and that this perversion leads to a bloating with external goods.
- The author notes that they were borne up to God by His beauty, but were soon borne down by their own weight, sinking into sorrow and inferior things due to the weight of carnal custom.
- The author reads the books of the Platonists, which teaches them to search for incorporeal truth, and they come to understand God's invisible works and eternal power through the things that are made.
- The author is assured of God's existence, infinity, and unchanging nature, and that all other things are from God, and they begin to see the world in a new light.

## The Concept of the Beatitudes and the Importance of Humility and Meekness
- The author meets Simplicianus, who congratulates them on not falling into the writings of other philosophers, which are full of fallacies and deceit, and instead finding the pathway to belief in God and His Word through the Platonists.
- The author comes across the story of Anthony, a servant of God, and is inspired by his life, leading them to meditate on embracing a similar life, giving up worldly employment to seek God alone.

- The author reflects on the fleeting nature of earthly things and the importance of seeking a life with God, and how this realization can lead to a change of heart and a dropping away of worldly concerns.
- The text from the document '**JOURNAL314**' appears to be a philosophical and spiritual reflection, heavily influenced by the writings of Augustine, where the author grapples with the conflict between worldly desires and the pursuit of a higher, spiritual truth.
- The author describes a state of inner turmoil, where the soul is pulled apart by two opposing wills, one carnal and the other spiritual, leading to a sense of grievous perplexities and a divided self, as the individual struggles to reconcile their earthly desires with their longing for the divine.
- The text references Augustine's reading of the Bible, specifically a passage that advises against indulging in worldly vices and instead encourages the reader to "put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof".
- The author reflects on the difficulty of breaking free from the tyranny of habit and the slavery of worldly business, which holds the mind captive even against its will, and expresses a deep-seated desire to serve a higher power, but is hesitant due to uncertainty and fear of letting go of worldly entanglements.
- The passage also touches on the idea that the mind has a innate knowledge of the unchangeable and the eternal, and that this knowledge can be accessed through introspection and contemplation, but the author acknowledges their own weakness and inability to sustain a gaze on the divine, leading to a relapse into accustomed ways.
- The text concludes by highlighting the author's sense of longing and yearning for a deeper connection with the divine, and the recognition of the immense difficulty of returning to this state, with the phrase "how high art Thou in the highest, and how deep in the deepest, and Thou never departest, and we scarcely return to Thee".

## The Influence of Jesus' Teachings and the Importance of Loving One's Enemies
- The individual in the story avoided distractions and focused on pursuing wisdom, reserving many hours to read, discuss, and listen to conversations about wisdom, and he eventually turned his eyes to a book that changed him inwardly.
- As he read the book, he began to question the purpose of his labors and the dangers of seeking favor with the Emperor, and he realized that he could become a friend of God immediately, which led him to break loose from his worldly hopes and resolve to serve God.
- The individual's friend decided to follow him in his decision to serve God, and they both began to build their spiritual tower by forsaking all their worldly possessions and following God, with their affianced brides also dedicating their virginity to God.
- The narrator of the story, who is not explicitly named but appears to be the author of the Journal314, reflects on his own life and feels a sense of abhorrence towards himself when compared to the individuals who have resigned themselves to God, as he has been deferring his own decision to reject earthly felicity and follow God for many years.
- The narrator recalls being stirred to an earnest love of wisdom after reading Cicero's Hortensius at the age of 19, but he has been delaying his decision to follow God, and he is now ashamed that the unlearned are taking heaven by force while he, with his learning, is still wallowing in flesh and blood.
- The narrator is torn between his desire for spiritual health and his inability to take action, and he is aware of the contradiction between his mind commanding his body and his body not obeying, which is preventing him from doing what he truly desires.
- The story highlights the themes of spiritual struggle, the pursuit of wisdom, and the tension between worldly desires and spiritual aspirations, as the characters navigate their relationships with God and their own sense of purpose.
