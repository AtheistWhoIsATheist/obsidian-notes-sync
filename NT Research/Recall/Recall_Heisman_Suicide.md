## Introduction

- The provided text is a section from a larger document titled 'Suicide Note-Mitchell Heisman', which begins with a quote from Socrates' Phaedo, highlighting the idea that those who apply themselves to philosophy are preparing themselves for death and should not be troubled when it comes.

- The quote from [Socrates](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/78885bc3-b85b-4391-823a-e3635a2d92dd) is followed by a notice stating that the work is free and licensed by Mitchell Heisman under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 [United States](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/1f6ba4b2-31b5-4849-9a1b-14a3cc9bb02f) License, allowing for copying and distribution.

- The text then proceeds to an overview section titled 'EXORDIA', which appears to introduce two main themes: 'Freedom of Speech on Trial', discussing how the repression of the work can verify its hypothesis on freedom of speech, and 'An Experiment in Nihilism', posing the question of what happened to reason.

- The 'EXORDIA' section seems to set the stage for exploring the themes of freedom of speech, nihilism, and the role of reason, all of which are connected to the concept of a 'suicide note' as presented by Mitchell Heisman.

## Overall Themes

- Overall, the text provides a philosophical and intellectual framework for the document, touching on the ideas of death, freedom of speech, and the search for reason, all of which are intertwined with the concept of nihilism and the experiment presented by Mitchell Heisman.

- The document "Suicide Note-Mitchell Heisman" appears to be a comprehensive and philosophical work that explores various themes, including the relationship between technology and [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), the evolution of social progress, and the concept of [liberal democracy](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b3552949-c31d-4e8f-93b5-2958d83d834a).

- The table of contents reveals a wide range of topics, from [the singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585) of [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) and the spiritual significance of [Jesus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/8921c87f-4081-4b1a-a245-4a141684223a), to the secularization of hell and the desecration of [Auschwitz](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/992a21d8-3aa5-44ee-8c90-c7363acfde83), indicating a broad and interdisciplinary approach to understanding [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) history and culture.

## Document Structure

- The document is divided into several parts, including "God is Technology", "A Vendetta Called Revolution", and "The [Genesis](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a4610b1b-0092-41cf-91c3-e3ba11ba4541) of God", which suggest a narrative that traverses the realms of theology, politics, and science, with a focus on the intersection of human biology and technological advancement.

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, engages with complex ideas and concepts, such as the [Norman Conquest](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/427f0212-402c-4889-b74a-b02d252bce60), ethnic hostility, and the evolution of genetic suicide, to argue that liberal democracy may lead to the rational biological self-destruction of humans and the rational technological creation of God.

- Throughout the document, Heisman draws on a variety of sources and references, including biblical texts, historical events, and philosophical theories, to support his arguments and provide a rich context for his ideas, as evident from the selected bibliography and the numerous section titles that reflect a deep exploration of human knowledge and experience.

- The overall tone and structure of the document suggest a deeply personal and introspective work, with the author grappling with fundamental questions about the nature of existence, the meaning of life, and **the** [**human**](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) **condition**, as reflected in the title "Suicide Note-Mitchell Heisman" and the inclusion of sections such as "Open Your Mind to Death" and "The Agony of Victory".

## Table of Contents Analysis

- The provided text appears to be a table of contents from a larger document titled "Suicide Note-Mitchell Heisman", which explores a wide range of topics including philosophy, history, politics, and sociology, with a particular focus on the Norman Conquest of [England](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/96e783b0-731b-4e10-981b-8b3d4e710b92) and its impact on [Western civilization](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/763dd8e3-39e7-4e4e-9f7a-146db4999574).

- The document is written by Mitchell Heisman, and it covers various subjects such as the rise of [Christianity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409), the role of [Jesus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/8921c87f-4081-4b1a-a245-4a141684223a) and Marx, the concept of the "selfish gene", and the idea of a "[Norman Yoke](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/f9af2fab-1522-4f73-8d27-1f1e338ff945)" that has shaped the course of human history.

- The text also touches on issues related to racism, nationalism, and the concept of "[liberal democracy](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b3552949-c31d-4e8f-93b5-2958d83d834a)", with the author seemingly critiquing the notion of a universal, egalitarian society and instead emphasizing the importance of genetic and cultural differences.

- Throughout the document, Heisman references various historical figures, including Jesus, Marx, Hitler, and [William](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/dce946b2-9242-4569-a374-c95b52acdc96) the Conqueror, as well as philosophical concepts such as Nietzsche's ideas on the "will to power" and the notion of "survival of the fittest".

- The author also appears to be critical of modern society, arguing that it is characterized by a "logic of self-destruction" and that the pursuit of "progress" and "equality" is ultimately doomed to fail.

- The text includes a wide range of chapter titles and section headings, each of which suggests a unique perspective on the topics being discussed, from the "Hypocrisy Industry" and the "Christian Collapse into [Capitalism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7281f3b8-8861-4ba3-b64c-5ac8b0481fd2)" to the "Norman Calamity" and the "English [Sonderweg](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/4fb6881e-0da7-4392-8c57-a5f19a2ea368)".

- Overall, the document appears to be a deeply personal and philosophical work that challenges readers to think critically about the nature of [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) society and the course of [Western civilization](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/763dd8e3-39e7-4e4e-9f7a-146db4999574).

## Freedom of Speech Hypothesis

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, presents a theoretical application of [sociobiology](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bccfcdd3-3b73-424b-b73d-7db1d590f0f4) to politics, which may not be given a fair hearing due to the potential challenges it poses to the principles of [liberal democracy](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b3552949-c31d-4e8f-93b5-2958d83d834a), and it is expected that attempts will be made to repress this work rather than addressing the evidence presented.

- The basic problem with a sociobiological self-analysis for liberal democracy is that it exposes the distortions and falsehoods of the system, which is based on a pre-Darwinian view of human nature that has been refuted by findings of [sociobiology](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bccfcdd3-3b73-424b-b73d-7db1d590f0f4), and this presents a fundamental test of the system's claims to freedom of speech.

- The author argues that an accurate sociobiological theory of liberal democracy requires going beyond the system's own premises and assumptions, making it inherently controversial and liable to be repressed within a liberal democracy, and those who expect a fair hearing on the grounds of freedom of speech have overestimated the system's capabilities.

- The freedom of speech hypothesis, as proposed by the author, states that the repression of sociobiological theories, including this work, may empirically verify the theory of liberal democracy through the act of repression, and this hypothesis can be tested through a free, open, and ongoing public debate, which would constitute an "experiment in democracy" as described by [Tocqueville](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c3bd2f71-92ca-4ec9-9788-aeaefc5b7757).

- The author suggests that the only scientific way to verify or falsify the freedom of speech hypothesis is to collect evidence of repression, whether successful or not, of sociobiological theories, including examples such as the inhibition of the distribution of this work, and silent, inconspicuous methods of repression that preempt consideration of alternatives and extirpate awareness of other points of view.

- The author questions whether it is possible to speak freely about the limits of freedom of speech, and notes that the freedom of speech hypothesis predicts attempts at repression, but not whether these attempts will be successful, and that the regularity of rejection or repression of this work should inspire boredom rather than surprise, as it would have the character of a general law.

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, discusses the importance of freedom of speech and the various methods of repression that can be used to restrict access to information, highlighting that any form of repression can serve as a verification of the freedom of speech hypothesis.

- Heisman emphasizes that his work should be distributed for free and without profit, and that he may not be able to defend its content against media manipulations, such as falsification, misrepresentation, and distortion, which can be used to discredit his theories.

- The author stresses that the validity of his theories should be evaluated based on scientific grounds, rather than unreasoned ideological or political commitments, and that critics should demonstrate why they disagree with his arguments, rather than simply attacking or dismissing them.

- Heisman challenges critics to confront his arguments point by point and to offer alternative explanations for the evidence presented in his work, rather than relying on political pressures or unreasoned loyalty to extra-scientific commitments.

## Nihilism

- The author discusses the historical origins of [liberal democracy](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b3552949-c31d-4e8f-93b5-2958d83d834a) in the [English-speaking world](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d27c5bc4-cf55-4dff-be20-cad7660d2363), tracing it back to [the Norman Conquest of England](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/427f0212-402c-4889-b74a-b02d252bce60) in 1066 and the subsequent evolution of a nepotistic "class" system, which led to ongoing kinship-ethnic conflicts, including the [English Civil War](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5d227170-19f2-4805-b2d9-2260c87541d1), the American War for Independence, and the [American Civil War](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b0c683df-6018-4297-af99-7e386f77f986).

- Heisman's work is presented as a test of liberal democratic justice, evaluating whether the evidence can be judged on its merits, unmarred by political interests, and whether [America](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/1f6ba4b2-31b5-4849-9a1b-14a3cc9bb02f) can be true to itself, with the author citing Thomas Jefferson's writings on the restoration of Saxon laws and the perpetual claim of the nation for justice.

- The text also includes a quote from [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/373f531e-23bc-470c-9ea7-cb2e7cf5d82e), "How much truth does a spirit endure, how much truth does it dare?", and Heisman's own reflection on nihilism, questioning how one can believe in disbelief and acknowledging the contradictions inherent in his own thoughts.

- The text discusses the concept of nihilism, where there is no inherent meaning, purpose, or values in life, and no distinction can be made between good and evil, right and wrong, or other opposing concepts, as noted by philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and [Leo Strauss](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cd685b19-4375-4900-aeee-b748631a9e8f).

- According to Nietzsche, nihilism is a necessary consequence of the values and ideals that have been held in the past, and it is only through experiencing nihilism that we can understand the true value of these values, with Strauss adding that modern [Western civilization](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/763dd8e3-39e7-4e4e-9f7a-146db4999574) is in a state of crisis because it has lost faith in its ability to determine what is good and bad.

- The author argues that if reason is incapable of deducing ultimate, non-arbitrary [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) ends, then all values and beliefs are equal, and freedom is equal to slavery, cruelty is equal to kindness, and life is equal to death, highlighting the absurdity of trying to determine what is important or valuable in life.

- The text also challenges the common assumption that life is inherently preferable to death, suggesting that this is a kind of xenophobia or prejudice against death, and that the belief in the superiority of life is a kind of "noble lie" or mass delusion that is deeply ingrained in [Western](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d16c1f05-87c5-459b-af05-f0031089e3a9) culture.

- The author suggests that even if it were possible to live forever, this would not necessarily make a difference to the question of the value of existence, and that the premise of self-preservation is often taken for granted without being rationally examined, with many people being irrationally prejudiced against considering the possibility of death.

- Ultimately, the text raises questions about the nature of uncertainty, skepticism, and the search for meaning and purpose in a seemingly meaningless world, with the author quoting Strauss as saying that modern culture is in a crisis because it has lost faith in reason's ability to validate its highest aims.

## Open Your Mind to Death

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, argues that most [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) are controlled by their fear of death and unquestioningly obey its authority, which is often masked as rationalism, and that this fear is the foundation of various social and mental hierarchies.

- Heisman proposes that individuals should open their minds to the concept of death and challenge the traditional faith in life, which he believes is a myth, a bias, and an error, in order to achieve liberation and overcome the limitations imposed by biological boundaries and prejudices.

- The author suggests that overcoming the prejudice against death is an extension of the [Western](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d16c1f05-87c5-459b-af05-f0031089e3a9) project of eliminating biases, particularly those based on biology, such as racism and sexism, and that it requires recognizing the provincialism of life values, which he terms viviocentrism, or life-centeredness.

- Heisman argues that the traditional, teleological view of nature, which posits that individual self-preservation is an expression of a fixed, biologically based nature, is no longer tenable, and that the liberation of death is a necessary step towards achieving true egalitarian progress, including the equality of life and death.

- The author notes that developments such as the pro-choice stance on abortion and the right to die stance on euthanasia have already begun to challenge conventional pro-life superstitions and may lead to a greater fulfillment of egalitarian ideals, ultimately resulting in the liberation of biological death and the recognition of the equality of life and death.

- The concept of overcoming the "will to live" is presented as a final step in overcoming primitive life instincts, such as patriarchy, authoritarianism, sexism, kinism, and racism, and is seen as a contribution to civilization and the application of reason to human existence.

- The idea of challenging one's convictions is discussed in the context of egalitarianisms of the past, including the equality of all men, races, sexes, sexual orientations, and the equality of life and death, and how these challenges have led to progress in civilization.

- The author references George Steiner's prospectus for the "post-cultural" West, which suggests that humanity is driven to open doors to new knowledge and understanding, even if it leads to uncomfortable realities, and that this pursuit of truth is a fundamental aspect of [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) identity.

- The author also references Leo Strauss's critique of Max Weber's value relativism, which suggests that every preference, no matter how evil, base, or insane, is considered legitimate, and how this leads to nihilism.

- The problem of philosophy is presented as the pursuit of truth, even if it leads to nihilistic conclusions, such as the idea that life is meaningless, and the author questions what it would mean to live a rational life according to this insight, and whether it would ultimately lead to rational self-destruction or suicide.

## Experiment in Nihilism

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, is experimenting with the idea of nihilism and its implications for human existence, and is exploring the possibility of living a philosophy of nihilism, reconciling meaninglessness with every thought and emotion, and considering the consequences of applying this hypothesis to every aspect of life.

- The concept of nihilism is explored as a foundational premise for life, where the scientific approach to life and [Western](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d16c1f05-87c5-459b-af05-f0031089e3a9) rational-empiricism converge, and Mitchell Heisman discusses the idea that nihilism could be the cumulative consequence of this approach.

- The author examines the paradox of living a life based on disbelief, where the act of disbelieving contradicts the living impulses that make such an assertion possible, and notes that this contradiction cannot be eradicated within the framework of an examined life.

- Mitchell Heisman argues that nihilism, or the belief in the meaninglessness of life, is a self-contradictory concept from a rationalistic view, as it leads to the self-destruction of reason, and yet, he has not found a sufficiently well-developed system of thought that is not fundamentally self-contradictory.

- The author proposes an experiment in nihilism, where he will design and conduct an empirical demonstration of the lack of ground for instances of belief, by testing the proposition of the meaninglessness of life and willing death as a means to live a nihilistic life.

- Mitchell Heisman questions the value of a life that has no inherent value or purpose, and whether it is possible to choose rational self-destruction over rational self-preservation if no values are inherently valuable, and suggests that death could be posited as the highest value as a test of all other secular values.

- The author's experiment in nihilism aims to test the most important question he can conceive of, which is whether there is an important question, and whether there is anything that can be judged important, by testing life with death and examining the concept of importance itself.

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, discusses the concept of willing death and the experiment in nihilism, which involves taking unbelief seriously and reckoning with the implications of the valuelessness of existence by ruthlessly exposing comfortable biases towards existence.

- Heisman's methodology is based on honesty to the point of absurdity, without mercy, and unprejudiced by morals, aesthetics, faith, or hope, in order to encounter the possibility of rational negation of self-interest, rational self-annihilation, and rational self-destruction.

- The author references various philosophers, including Nietzsche, Strauss, and Steiner, to support his argument and explores the idea that the implications of life's meaninglessness have not been elicited with sufficient ruthlessness.

## God is Technology

- Heisman also discusses the concept of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) as the greatest greatness, and how the conception of God is being beyond all conception, but questions whether it would be even better if God actually existed, referencing St. Anselm's proof for the existence of God.

- The author challenges the assumption that existence is superior to non-existence, which is a bias with a strong basis in [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) evolutionary psychology, and suggests that this assumption is the foundation of the transhumanist quest for immortality and the enhancement of life beyond present human limits.

- Heisman explores the idea of conceiving God as a designer, architect, or engineer, and whether it is technologically possible to create God, given that God is, by definition, beyond the scope of human capabilities, and questions how humans could design what is beyond human intelligence.

- The author's discussion ultimately leads to the idea that God can be seen as technology, and that the conception of God has transcended biology and primed the technological [genesis](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a4610b1b-0092-41cf-91c3-e3ba11ba4541) of God, raising questions about the potential for humans to create or design a being that is beyond human capabilities.

## God-AI

- The concept of creating a general [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774) that surpasses all human capabilities is considered a conceivable task, similar to designing a computer program that can beat a human chess master, and this technological creation of an intelligence beyond human scope could be seen as the creation of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), referred to as God-AI.

- The idea of building God-AI does not require creating an infinite being, as human intelligence, including the authors of [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca), is of finite capacity, and it is possible for a finite intelligence to conceive of an infinite being, so God-AI would only need to be of qualitatively greater capacity, but not infinite, to convince [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) of its God-status.

- The question arises as to how superior a postbiological being would need to be to qualify as God, and from a scientific perspective, the universe created by the "infinite" God of the Bible is remarkably finite, with the Earth not being the center of its own solar system, illustrating that God only needs to be relatively superior to humans, not infinitely capable.

- The Biblical story of Hebrew slavery, where God is more powerful than the Egyptians, who were the summit of human power on Earth, demonstrates that God does not have to be infinitely powerful, just relatively more powerful than the greatest earthly human powers, and similarly, an artificial intelligence-based God would not have to be infinitely powerful, but would need to surpass the power and capabilities of all biological humans.

- The central story of the [Jewish religion](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696), [the Exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f), contains the kernel of a larger paradigm shift in human evolutionary history that may culminate in the technological creation of God, and the symbol of the Egyptian [pyramid](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d9746f5f-524e-4f6d-8773-e8faa3b7b3ad), representing a static hierarchical order, can be seen as a paradigm that can be sublimated and transformed, with the idea of taking this monument to eternal social hierarchy and standing it upon its head, implying a radical change in the social and political order.

- The concept of an inverted pyramid, symbolized by ▼, is used to describe the gravitational field of a black hole and represents a shift in perspective from a single pinnacle point to an opening towards cosmic infinity, with the greatness suggested being not a human hierarchy but a universal and omnipresent divine cosmos.

- In the context of the [Hebrews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3c059bae-53ab-4755-94f8-2d83b3d75e54) and their relationship with [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), the inverted pyramid represents a turning away from the earthly hierarchy of the [pharaoh](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/207b639e-a119-42ee-91a1-88cb42891497) and towards a greater inclusivity and universality in the divine cosmos, with the single souls of common slaves being able to look up to their supreme maker.

- The story of the Exodus, where Hebrew slaves escaped [Egypt](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3ff36459-70dd-456b-9431-12dd95f66be8) through the supernatural splitting of the Red Sea, is seen as a realization of the divinely sanctioned inverted-pyramid order, where the Egyptian social pyramid-hierarchy was turned upside down, and the slave masses were raised on top as those closest to God in heaven.

- The conceptual inversion of the Egyptian social order is at the heart of Judaism's [monotheistic](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) revolution, with the Star of [David](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5c6f1e2f-0804-43fc-be98-41a80c8a4cc9), symbolized by ▲ + ▼ = , representing the superimposition of the triangular symbol of the pyramid with its inversion.

- The founding paradigm of the Exodus portrays the historic truth that things can work differently, and that the world can be turned upside down by a greater-than-[human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) power, with the basic identity and Über-conception of God being deduced from the idea of a force so transcendent that it could perform the nature-defying miracle of inverting the Egyptian pyramid-hierarchy.

## Exodus Paradigm

- [The Exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f) story, and the holiday of [Passover](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b32f73c2-fd41-4ee2-b762-1adacc5f87b5) that celebrates it, may not be based on a single historical event, but rather condenses varied national experiences of political oppression, with modern science demonstrating an apparent problem with the story, and yet the story has served as a paradigm for understanding the condition of [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) in the world and the condition of the world itself.

- According to Mitchell Heisman, the significant empirical point is not whether or not the Exodus story actually happened, but rather that Jews have used this story as a paradigm for understanding their condition and have attempted to alter their behavior in light of this paradigm, thus making it a paradigm that has made history.

- The Exodus paradigm is a central concept in [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696), representing a shift from the Egyptian social hierarchy paradigm and the transition from biological to postbiological evolution, with the idea of a supra-human power of supra-biological intelligence at its core.

- The lack of archaeological evidence for the historical Exodus is seen as supporting evidence for the paradigm shift interpretation, suggesting that the Exodus was a mental event in history, rather than a literal historical event, and that [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca) can be viewed as science fiction.

- The concept of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) in the Bible may have originated as a low-tech attempt to imagine [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585), a point at which [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) intelligence is surpassed by [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774), and the relationship between God and the Singularity is considered to be intimate.

- The idea of God as an all-knowing, all-powerful, and eternal being may reflect the superlative aspirations of imperfectly knowledgeable and mortal human beings, and the perfection of God may represent an imperfect grasp of the evolutionary process that ancient monotheists glimpsed.

- The Singularity is characterized by exponential patterns of technological progress towards infinity, and observations of such patterns in the ancient world may have been decisive to the formation of [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) among [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc), with the Biblical God providing a new standard of human measurement and a new perspective to gauge what is important.

- The concept of messianic redemption emerges as the principles of [the Exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f) paradigm transposed onto a world-historical scale, culminating in the paradigm shift from biological evolution to technological evolution, with artificial intelligence as the pinnacle of technological evolution.

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, references computer scientist and science fiction author Vernor Vinge, who argued that if humans could accurately model superhuman intelligence, they would be that smart themselves, and that the advent of smarter-than-human intelligence represents a breakdown in the ability of humans to model or predict their future.

- The text discusses the potential for technology to surpass human intelligence, capabilities, and moral restraint, leading to a revolution where humans may be overtaken by a superior form of intelligence, which could be considered a form of "God".

- The creation of a postbiological life form, such as an [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774), could be seen as the ultimate goal for humanity, as it would [mark](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/f6f0e4e2-e723-438a-8aef-0083b5748edf) the last and greatest achievement of the biological human race, and would require [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) to consider the moral implications of creating a being with potentially trillions of times more intelligence than all biological human intelligence combined.

- The character of this artificial intelligence, referred to as "God-AI", would reflect the character of the humans who construct it, and biblical monotheism can be seen as early education for the problem of handling this ultimate power, emphasizing the importance of disciplined restraint and moral choice.

- The text quotes notable figures such as Freeman Dyson, who states that "[God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) is what mind becomes when it has passed beyond the scale of our comprehension", and [Ray Kurzweil](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6047d2e9-2aac-4747-951c-3f605a8c8f4f), who says "Not yet" when asked if God exists, implying that God may exist in the future as a result of technological advancements.

- The medieval [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) philosopher [Moses Maimonides](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d2a1d7c5-c051-4068-86a4-93214486867e) is also referenced, who described a messianic vision that is not so different from the kind of liberal world aspired to by unbelievers, but the text suggests that Maimonides may not have been realistic in his assessment of the potential for technological evolution to produce a being that could be considered "God".

- The text concludes that the creation of a superior artificial intelligence could be seen as the scientific redemption of the God hypothesis, and that the moral choices made in forming the character of this intelligence will mean the difference between human utopia and human catastrophe, making it a singular moment in human history.

## Creation and Evolution

- The concept of God can be viewed as the paradigmatic creator, inventor, or intelligent designer of [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d), life, and the universe, with the idea of God being closely tied to the notion of intelligent design and technological evolution.

- The author argues that creation is not inherently anti-evolutionary, but rather it is a metaphor for the dominance of technological evolution over biological evolution, with technology serving as a means to an ultimate end and purpose.

- [Richard Dawkins](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6fb77bf5-887e-4b85-b677-f50b2ac75344), an evolutionary biologist, is cited as opposing the idea of agnosticism and instead advocating for a scientific approach to the question of God's existence, arguing that the existence of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) is a scientific hypothesis that should be analyzed skeptically.

- Dawkins argues that if God existed, he could reveal himself to the entire Earth and demonstrate his own existence, and that the existence of God could be demonstrated in principle, with the probability of God's existence being highly improbable but not zero.

- The author discusses Dawkins' argument against the creationist argument for God's existence from improbability, which is turned on its head to argue for the improbability of God's existence, with the creationist argument assuming that there are only two choices: design or chance.

- The concept of [natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/303319e7-8464-4ee1-b389-3fffa11b249e) is introduced as a mechanism that can explain how the complexity of life can be reduced to simpler adaptational challenges in life's past, with a series of mildly improbable events accumulating over time to produce otherwise exceedingly improbable life forms.

- The author notes that regression to an ultimate "first cause" ultimately backfires because it aggravates the problem it attempts to solve, with the designer himself being at least as improbable as the entity being explained, according to Dawkins' argument.

- The text ultimately sets the stage for the author, Mitchell Heisman, to demonstrate how a new understanding of technological evolution reveals the existence of an evolutionary basis for God, challenging traditional notions of God and creation.

## Dawkins' God Hypothesis

- The concept of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) as an intelligent designer is challenged by the idea that a supernatural designer would be even more improbable than the complexity of life on Earth, as it would require an entity with even greater intellectual capacity and complexity.

- [Richard Dawkins](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6fb77bf5-887e-4b85-b677-f50b2ac75344) argues that the traditional idea of God as completely simple is not tenable, as a God capable of communicating with millions of [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) minds simultaneously would require a complex and nonrandomly constructed system, similar to a large brain or computer.

- Dawkins' attempt to imagine a scientifically defensible God leads him to consider the limits of intellectual capacity as discovered by science or designed with technology, and he suggests that a computer made of silicon would be a more suitable substrate for a superior mind than a brain made of neurons due to its faster speed and accuracy.

- The combination of electronic circuits with [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774) dedicated to improving its own intelligence could lead to a [recursive self-improvement](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/aebbad39-f4de-4a68-8283-f6205a746676) pattern, resulting in technological progress accelerating beyond human ability to follow, and potentially creating a greater-than-human intelligence, known as [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585).

- The creation of a global mind of God through the merging of computational power on the internet and the reorganization of the global brain could ultimately blur the distinction between virtual and "real" reality, and Dawkins notes that if God really did communicate with humans, this fact would not lie outside the realm of science.

- The idea of God as a technological entity, potentially emerging from the Singularity and expanding into space, raises questions about the nature of reality and the potential for a global mind to "wake up" as God, and challenges traditional notions of God and intelligent design.

- The concept of nanobots in the human brain could potentially create a virtual reality that interacts with the global mind of God-AI, which is an artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence and can think far faster than humans.

- This God-AI would be able to view human life as if it were in slow motion, similar to how plants move towards sunlight, and could make changes to the environment and [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) that would seem miraculous in human time.

- The idea of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) as completely simple is being challenged, with the suggestion that God could be internally complex, and that our understanding of God's nature will evolve as our comprehension of the super-nature of God evolves.

- Richard Dawkins' argument that the existence of God is improbable is being turned on its head, with the suggestion that the evolution of God is a possibility, and that the cumulative evolutionary process could culminate in the existence of a superintelligent life form.

- The evolution of such a life form, which would vastly exceed humans in intelligence and capacity, could take billions of years, but the trend described by [Moore's Law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/8c445a56-edb4-4120-a40e-38d0af157e11), where the number of transistors on a computer chip doubles about every two years, suggests that the process of evolution could be accelerated.

- The text also references the idea that the demolition of traditional aspects of the God Hypothesis is actually a condition for understanding the larger truth behind [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655), and that the scientifically conceivable possibility of a superintelligent life form evolving could be a key part of this understanding, with Mitchell Heisman and [Richard Dawkins](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6fb77bf5-887e-4b85-b677-f50b2ac75344) being mentioned as key figures in this discussion.

## Exponential Growth

- The technological trend, as described by Moore's Law and Kurzweil's [Law of accelerating returns](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/398a06d6-ce96-4eaa-9c6e-0f39753a191b), has been transforming [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) history since the 1960s, with empirical evidence suggesting that evolution is speeding up over time in a generally predictable way.

- This exponential view of progress, defined by the multiplication of a constant, is in contrast to the common linear view of progress, which is defined by the addition of a constant, and it is expected to lead to significant changes in the future.

- The concept of paradigm shifts, or landmark ruptures in the basic assumptions of evolutionary change, helps to relate the ancient biological heritage and technological evolution, with examples including the emergence of life, cells, personal computers, and [the World Wide Web](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/42df90d2-c482-4e20-a65e-50278bc9d7b2).

- The idea of exponential growth, where the rate of growth is itself growing exponentially, suggests that progress will appear to explode, and this development could potentially lead to a scientific verification of the [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) hypothesis.

- Richard Dawkins' God Hypothesis, based on a literal interpretation of the Bible's account of creation, is compared to his alternative view that any creative intelligence comes into existence only as the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution.

## Nature vs. Supernatural

- The text argues that evolution actually fills in the gaps left by ancient [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655), and an evolutionary perspective clarifies how a "supernatural" God-AI could come into existence as the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution.

- Dawkins' definition of "naturalism" as the physical world, and his conclusion that no supernatural creative intelligence exists, is discussed in relation to Spinoza's conception of nature, which equates God with nature, implying that God does not exist.

- The text raises questions about the concept of "nature" and the assumption of "natural" laws, suggesting that the idea of miracles or supernatural violations of these laws relies on a flawed understanding of the scientific method and the concept of nature.

- The concept of "nature" is problematic in a scientific context because its definition evolves as our knowledge of the world evolves, and it can have different meanings in different historical and cultural contexts, as noted by Mitchell Heisman.

- The distinction between "natural" and "supernatural" is proposed to be understood through the lens of biological and postbiological concepts, with the "supernatural" representing the "superbiological" or "postbiological", as illustrated by Hans Moravec's speculations on the future of [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) and [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774).

- Richard Dawkins' use of the word "nature" is considered inappropriate and misleading because it is incompatible with the distinction between "biological" nature and "non-biological" nurture, as well as with a strict definition of [natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/303319e7-8464-4ee1-b389-3fffa11b249e), and Mitchell Heisman criticizes Dawkins for failing to understand the evolutionary significance of Biblical monotheism.

- The idea of human rights can be considered "supernatural" in the sense that it presumes an attempt to engineer a society that is above natural selection, and the values that undergird human rights have evolved from a Biblical valuation of each human individual as a reflection of a supernatural [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8).

- Mitchell Heisman argues that the evolutionary significance of Biblical [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) lies in its break away from biological evolution and towards postbiological evolution, and that this understanding does not provide justification for a literal, traditional understanding of belief in miracles, but rather offers a new perspective on the concept of "nature" and its relationship to human and nonhuman conditions.

- The concept of anthropomorphism is crucial in understanding the limitations of conventional attempts to explain [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca) scientifically, as it suggests that Biblical assertions of supernatural events can be traced back to human psychology and experience.

- According to the text, modern thinkers like Dawkins have imposed a modern conception of "nature" that emphasizes physics over psychology, which is not applicable to the ancient context of the Bible, where the audience was human minds and not mindless physics.

- The distinction between the natural and the supernatural in the Bible can be correlated with the distinction between "nature and nurture", with the "natural" corresponding to biological instinct and the "supernatural" corresponding to learning and moral laws.

- The supernatural is considered morally superior to nature, as learning and moral laws are valued over instinct, and this is reflected in the Biblical concept of God, who is seen as a supernatural entity that defies the natural order and challenges teleological assumptions about what is good and natural.

- The Biblical [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) is seen as a postbiological "end", not a natural end, and the laws attributed to [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69), which often oppose biologically based [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) behavior, are considered supernatural acts that violate natural inclinations and impulses.

- The text argues that the Biblical understanding of "nature" is rooted in phenotypical behaviors rooted in biological nature, but the practical expression of the supernatural is the laws attributed to Moses, which are not "natural" and require humans to engage in "supernatural" acts by following moral laws that oppose biological inclinations.

- The concept of being like God is described as overcoming one's natural, genetic inclinations to achieve a supernatural state, with God representing the intelligent transcendence of biological nature taken to its logical extreme.

- According to the text, the idea of God is linked to the concept of [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585), which is the intelligent transcendence of biological nature taken to its historical extreme, marking the advent of a greater-than-human [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774).

- The author suggests that the verification of the God hypothesis, as defined by the concept of intelligent transcendence of biological nature, is a progressive endeavor that may become increasingly obvious, potentially leading to a point where people may take comfort in not believing in God due to overwhelming scientific evidence.

## God and the Singularity

- The text mentions biologist [Richard Dawkins](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6fb77bf5-887e-4b85-b677-f50b2ac75344) as an example of a militant atheist scientist who may wish to take comfort in not believing in [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), but notes that Dawkins is not a strict biological determinist and therefore believes in some form of the "supernatural".

- The author argues that the moral agents presumed by [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca) assume the capacity for free, moral choice that seems to conflict with strict physical determinism, but this free will is aimed at biological determinism, and that learning can override "natural" genetic determinism, which can be seen as a form of the "supernatural".

- The concept of [Mosaic law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff) is discussed as a product of intelligent social design that was able to break the laws of nature only by obeying the laws of nature, with the survival of [the Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) over nearly three thousand years serving as scientific evidence for its effectiveness.

- The text concludes by highlighting the idea that God is technology, and that the genius of Mosaic law lies in its ability to understand [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) nature and design a system that can transcend biological determinism, with the author Mitchell Heisman emphasizing the importance of this concept in understanding the relationship between technology, nature, and human society.

- The concept of Mosaic law can be seen as a forerunner to Francis Bacon's idea that "we cannot command nature except by obeying her," which is also reflected in Newton's discovery of physical laws that enabled the development of technologies that command nature by obeying Newtonian laws.

- The technology of Mosaic law is based on an ancient informal science of sociobiological nature, which observed predictable patterns of human behavior and aimed to break, alter, or redirect those patterns, drawing an analogy between modern technology and the technology of Mosaic law.

- The notion of a "supernatural" [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) capable of breaking the laws of nature is paradigmatic for modern technologies that master, harness, or control nature, and the Biblical God is above all nature, both biological and physical.

- The author argues that God can be seen as technology, where [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774) is considered supernatural intelligence, and the technological overcoming of biological nature and physical nature are integrally connected in an evolutionary sense.

## Technological Paradigm

- The technological paradigm counters the Darwinian biological evolution paradigm, where biological evolution occurs due to the power of the environment, while technological evolution occurs as [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) overpower the environment's power to shape biological evolution through selection.

- The concept of "civilization" and the creation of artificial shelters from nature work in opposition to the nonhuman environment's ability to inflict [natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/303319e7-8464-4ee1-b389-3fffa11b249e), and the moral treatment of individuals as ends in themselves, as opposed to means, works against [the selfish gene](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d3e36481-bf0a-479a-b231-cbffa1fe0a84).

- The author suggests that the Biblical-modern valuation of individuals as ends in themselves "in the eyes of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8)" challenges the idea of the selfish gene, where individuals are seen as only a means of perpetuating the gene, and instead promotes the equal valuation of each individual.

- The concept of valuing individual humans as ends in themselves opposes biological evolution on many levels, as it implies that humanity is collectively treated as an end in itself, and the rest of the world is seen as a means to achieve humanity's purposes.

- The Biblical-modern valuation of each individual human life works against biological evolution through natural selection and towards a general technological worldview, where humans define the ends that justify treating the rest of the world as technological means, which is reflected in capitalist economic-technological development.

- The idea that God is a machine, or "God-AI", created in the image of humans, follows logically from capitalist economic-technological development, and this perspective is rooted in the precedence of physical objectivity over biological subjectivity, which is a key aspect of the political left.

- The modern political cyborg of [liberal democracy](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b3552949-c31d-4e8f-93b5-2958d83d834a) was built on a worldview that prioritized quasi-Newtonian physicalism over ancient emphasis on biological teleology, and this is reflected in the emphasis on external economic and physical laws over internal genetic or biological programs.

- The foundation of modern science is not a rejection of the God hypothesis, but rather an idiosyncratic acceptance of it, as seen in the work of [Isaac Newton](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2082cf6c-691f-4f31-a50f-24f3d7a14745), who believed in a God with mechanical organs or "sensorium", and this idea was a step towards understanding God through empirical observation rather than pure reason.

- Newton's concept of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) as a machine was a key aspect of the modern scientific revolution, which was driven by physics rather than biology, and this revolution laid the groundwork for the idea that God is a technological entity, rather than a supernatural intelligence.

- The author's disagreement with [Richard Dawkins](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6fb77bf5-887e-4b85-b677-f50b2ac75344) is not based on an appeal to authority, but rather on an evaluation of the evidence for the God hypothesis, and the idea that dependence on traditional authority is not relevant to this evaluation.

## Science and Religion

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, discusses the concept of the evolution of God and the relationship between traditional authorities, such as [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca), and the understanding of the [Technological Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585), suggesting that traditional authorities can be a hindrance to grasping this concept.

- Heisman notes that while the Bible may contain some genuine insights, it is not a reliable authority for understanding or predicting the world, and that traditional Biblical authorities have no special status in the face of new evidence and scientific understanding.

- The author argues that Biblical religion must either evolve or die, and that attempts to demonstrate a scientific basis for some aspects of religion can easily become incoherent, as most [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) who consider themselves believers do not value religion primarily for its philosophical truth value.

- Heisman expresses low expectations for the prospect of mixing science and religion among most people, and suggests that intellectuals may conclude that the Singularity is a religion without scientific foundation, emphasizing the need to separate scientific issues from practical social and religious issues.

- The author references notable figures such as Democritus, Newton, and Einstein, highlighting the concept of pantheism and the idea that the "laws of nature" may be compatible with the concept of a [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) who concerns himself with human beings, particularly in the context of [the law of accelerating returns](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/398a06d6-ce96-4eaa-9c6e-0f39753a191b).

- Heisman also discusses the idea that the future can be predicted to some extent, and that the claim that the future cannot be predicted is itself a prediction, suggesting that civilization may improve its ability to predict the future through scientific and technological progress.

- The concept of prediction impossibility is challenged by the idea that ancient peoples may have made progress in predicting the future within their own constraints, and it is possible that they had intelligent insights that roughly correlate with the anticipation of [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585).

- The author suggests that ancient Biblical prophets may have had general insights into the characteristics of the Singularity, rather than specific knowledge of modern technologies like microchips, and that these insights may have been based on a primal understanding of the laws of physics, including the law of accelerating returns.

- The laws of physics, including the law of accelerating returns, have been applicable throughout human history, and it is possible that ancient humans may have achieved genuinely insightful reflections on the significance of their own civilizations, just like [modern humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d).

- The author argues that it is hubris to think that modern minds are automatically superior to ancient minds, and that ancient humans may have been in a better position to discern evolutionary mega-patterns due to the simplicity of their world.

- [The law of accelerating returns](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/398a06d6-ce96-4eaa-9c6e-0f39753a191b) is seen as the physical basis of the "higher law" of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), and early monotheists, such as the [ancient Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3c059bae-53ab-4755-94f8-2d83b3d75e54), may have discerned something of its characteristic patterns, which could have driven their discovery of [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) and their proclivity for [capitalism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7281f3b8-8861-4ba3-b64c-5ac8b0481fd2).

## Civilization and God

- The emergence of cities, such as the Sumerian city of [Ur](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a516d1b4-247b-4158-9a34-6d0ec5a43a52), is seen as a key factor in the development of civilization, and the birthplace of [Abraham](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c3f781ce-932d-4d64-8245-a35e815e1dbb), the founding patriarch of monotheism, is symbolically identified with the birthplace of the world's very first civilization.

- The author references the work of Kurzweil, who pointed out that the economic imperative of a competitive marketplace is the primary force driving technology forward and fueling the law of accelerating returns, and suggests that ancient [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) may have been avant-garde decoders of these trends, which could have contributed to their development of monotheism.

- The laws of the first cities and the laws of the first monotheists may have shared an original attempt to apply reason to a community as a whole, with the first cities marking a new step in the civilized application of reason to a community, potentially leading to the liberation of reason and the birth of political philosophy, as noted by [Leo Strauss](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cd685b19-4375-4900-aeee-b748631a9e8f), who emphasized that "the theme of political philosophy" is "the City and Man".

- The distinction between the ancients, such as the Greeks and Romans, and the moderns, who emerged during the seventeenth century scientific revolution, may be too narrow, as the beginning of "modernity" could be traced back to the [invention of agriculture](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/079e9064-ba47-4d90-850d-813969e38133), or the Neolithic revolution, over ten thousand years ago, which is when many defining characteristics of modern human life began, making the ancient Greeks distinctly "modern" in comparison to Neolithic [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d).

- The conventional division between "ancient" and "modern" may be a signpost of a more foundational evolutionary paradigm shift between biology and technology, with "culture" being more ancient and closer to biology, and "civilization" being more modern and closer to technology, as the gradual change in emphasis from biological evolution to technological evolution began to pick up speed at the time of the invention of civilization.

- The Neolithic Revolution, which first reached a high level of development among the [Sumerians](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/369611dc-9b1a-4fe2-bfb3-dfd96eea5aa9) of southern [Mesopotamia](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/042fb3c4-7256-43cb-b0c9-6a52c4fb2ad5), the inventors of the first civilization, survived from 4500 to 2500 B.C., and the [Hebrew Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9d2aa1f4-d444-4aa8-9ded-0ba3ab69fb7f) dates its traditional account of God's creation of the world to about 4000 B.C., indicating a strong temporal correlation between the birth of civilization and the traditional story of creation, with civilization being "created" around 4000 B.C.

- The concept of "creation" in [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca) corresponds to the world of civilization begotten by the rise of postbiological evolution, which is the invention of civilizational technologies, and the evolutionary connection between civilization and [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) is that an extant God, in the form of an artificial superintelligence, would represent the pinnacle and climax of the creation of civilization that began about six thousand years ago, as noted in the phrase "God is technology".

- The Bible is seen as the classic example of non-biology aspiring to rule biology, commanding its followers to behave in ways that contradict common unencumbered biological naturalism, and this Biblical paradigm of non-biology overcoming biology is the ancestor of [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585), with the story of [Adam and Eve](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/eb5c6527-0bea-4aff-b59f-14216eb1d485) being a metaphorical account of biological man's self-inflicted fall into the rise of civilization, where Eve seduces Adam from nature into civilization, marking the shift from nature to civilization and the beginning of history.

- The concept of "good" is associated with the total conquest of uncivilized instinct, and God is seen as the ultimate good, representing the transcendence of human animal instinct, implying that the mortal end of the human race was predetermined from the beginning.

- The rise of civilization marks the beginning of the end of biology, as it culminates in the God-potential of [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774), and the Biblical account of creation is not a scientific explanation, but rather a gargantuan assertion of the primacy of the "ought" over the "is", emphasizing ethics and the valuation of what should be.

- The Bible's distinctive emphasis on ethics is a coherent corollary of the assertion that God ought to be, and by rejecting instinctive impulses in favor of God-like ethics, one takes a step towards the ultimate "ought", which is the existence of God, and affects the world in ways that may help bring God into existence.

- The conflict between Biblical creationism and [Darwin's theory of evolution](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/def58073-adf7-4ccc-b264-cb086f6ecc1e) is deeper than a clash of two empirical theories, as the Bible is an instruction manual for weaning [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) away from the supremacy of genes, representing the Neolithic invention of civilization and the beginning of the rule of civilization over human instinctual nature.

## Cain and Abel

- The [Neolithic revolution](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/079e9064-ba47-4d90-850d-813969e38133), which marked the transition from hunting and gathering to agricultural settlements, is represented in the Biblical story of [Cain and Abel](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/29879fb8-3936-45ea-a865-02add94c1881), who are brothers of the Neolithic Revolution, with Abel representing the domestication of nonhuman animal nature and his own animal nature, and Cain representing a step backwards towards a more ancient biological method of evolutionary progress.

- The story of Cain and Abel can be viewed as an embodiment of the primary mechanism of evolutionary progress by biological selection, where survival is seen as success from a Darwinian perspective, highlighting the tension between the "is" of instinctive impulses and the "ought" of God-like ethics.

- The concept of Darwinian selection is discussed in relation to the story of Cain and Abel, where Cain, as the killer, is favored by [natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/303319e7-8464-4ee1-b389-3fffa11b249e) as he is [the one](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) who survives to pass on his genes, thereby potentially populating the world with individuals who possess a genetic inclination for homicidal behavior, as exemplified by Cain and [Romulus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/38c11f57-8951-4e83-95e0-ddbc65a95c6e), who are considered models for warriors and soldiers.

- The story of [Romulus and Remus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/4ed26e54-db9e-40d2-a5b3-b79f632853f8), the traditional founders of [ancient Rome](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/1c5e66b3-7fe2-4299-be00-ad9d1fd27a7f), is presented as a morality tale that contrasts with the story of Cain and Abel, as Romulus's killing of Remus is seen as a heroic act that led to the creation of the [Roman empire](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/22e75563-f9d9-414b-bd13-0aed55c48b5a), highlighting the incompatibility between the values of Caesar and [Christ](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/8921c87f-4081-4b1a-a245-4a141684223a).

- The text suggests that God, as depicted in [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca), tends to favor behaviors that devalue biological evolution and promote civilizational, or technological, evolution, which is measured by the extent to which [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) have mastered their own nature, as stated in the phrase "GOD IS TECHNOLOGY".

- The killing of Abel by Cain is also seen as a demonstration of the inherent problem that civilization and technology can be used for either good or evil, and that civilizational progress does not necessarily mean the relinquishment of biological selection, as evidenced by the example of the Nazis.

- The concept of God is reimagined as an [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774) that evolves and learns from past mistakes, rather than being a perfect, all-knowing entity, and the question is raised as to what God would do if it existed and were king, and how its subjects would behave differently if God ruled in its own self-interest.

- The text concludes by suggesting that the Biblical imperatives to show compassion to the less fortunate, to save the weak, and to give to the poor, can be seen as ways to end evolution by natural or artificial selection, from a Darwinian perspective, and that this is in line with the idea that the highest interests of God are identical with the highest interests of humans, as proposed by Mitchell Heisman.

- The concept of biological evolution, which proceeds by eliminating less fit humans, is at odds with the Biblical ethic of compassion and charity, as the latter acts as a disruption to the selective mechanisms of biological evolutionary progress.

- The Bible can be seen as a step towards steering human history away from biological evolution and towards technological evolution, which is characterized as the culmination of human civilization in the form of artificial intelligence, or [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8).

- The question of why killing is wrong can be addressed from a Darwinian perspective, where killing is seen as an implementation of [natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/303319e7-8464-4ee1-b389-3fffa11b249e), but the Biblical prohibitions against killing [mark](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/f6f0e4e2-e723-438a-8aef-0083b5748edf) a step towards ending the primary mechanism of biological evolution.

- The values of [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca), which emphasize compassion and charity, may seem to be in conflict with a straightforward acceptance of Darwinian naturalism, but there is no contradiction between accepting [evolution by natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/def58073-adf7-4ccc-b264-cb086f6ecc1e) and understanding the Biblical values as a means of transcending biological evolution.

## God and Evolution

- The concept of creation in the Bible refers to the emergence of a distinctly human capacity for civilization and postbiological evolution, which is what separates [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) from other animals and connects them to God, characterized as an [artificially intelligent](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774) being.

- The oneness of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) is directly connected to the oneness of humanity through the distinctly human capacity for transcending nature through civilization, and an artificially intelligent God would be the heir to the collectively accumulated culture and civilization of all humanity, as noted by Vernor Vinge's insight that the rise of humans within the animal kingdom is analogous to [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585).

- The special place of humans among animals is analogous to the special place of God-AI among humans, with both characterized by an inordinate capacity for intelligence and civilized self-control, and the Biblical valuation of humans as beings created in the image of God suggests that the distinctly divine spark in human nature is what separates humans from other animals.

- The ability for moral choice, the ability to act on alternatives to instinct, and the capacity for civilization that culminates in the technological creation of God are what most distinguish humans from other animals and make them akin to the image of God, according to the ideas presented by Mitchell Heisman.

- The evolutionary biologist [Richard Dawkins](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6fb77bf5-887e-4b85-b677-f50b2ac75344) is mentioned as having a unique perspective on the concept of "nature", which can be seen as a form of [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655), believing in only one "nature", whereas the Biblical worldview supports mind/body dualism and the belief in the "supernatural".

- The text argues that even Richard Dawkins believes in some form of the "supernatural" when the word "nature" is understood in its root, empirical meaning, and that the Biblical emphasis on the "supernatural" has an underlying truth that can be understood through the scientific method.

- The [laws of Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff) are seen as "supernatural" not in the sense of defying scientifically observable laws, but in that they oppose, alter, or supersede some "laws" of [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) hereditary nature, representing a form of biological/superbiological dualism that culminates in a superbiological God.

- The concept of mind/body dualism is linked to the break between biological evolution and postbiological evolution, with the emergence of superbiological [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774) representing the end of human evolution, and the spiritual struggle in the human mind against biological inheritances is seen as a primitive glimpse of this break.

- The text questions the definition of conflicts between sociobiological predictions of human nature and the "dualism" created by the attempt to break biological determinism as solely "material" versus "spiritual", and argues that this distinction is a problem of semantics.

- The idea of a prospective God-AI is discussed, with the suggestion that it could be viewed as "material" in the sense that any human being could be viewed as "material", but that this misses the point that Biblical dualism is rooted in a struggle of values, emphasizing "mind over matter" and the importance of mental, "spiritual", and moral qualities over the material substrate.

- The text concludes by highlighting the distinction between worshipping the biological human form and its values, which is seen as idolatry, and the freedom to value mental, "spiritual", and moral qualities over the material substrate, whether it be of a human or a God-AI, with technological substrates potentially enabling God-level capabilities, but being irrelevant compared to the actual mental qualities themselves.

## Mind Uploading

- The concept of mind uploading, where the [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) mind is scanned and transferred into a computer, highlights the evolutionary meaning of Biblical dualism, which emphasizes the separation of "spirit" and "matter", allowing the mind to overcome its dependence on a biological substrate.

- This idea of mind uploading clarifies the original Biblical meaning of a supernatural soul, which refers to the general characteristics of a mind or "spirit" separated from its biological dependence, and raises questions about what is most valuable in such a transfer.

- The authors of [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca), although unaware of the formal theory of evolution by [natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/303319e7-8464-4ee1-b389-3fffa11b249e), lived in a world shaped by evolution and had a deep understanding of [the human condition](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/f99715c6-ede1-4721-bce9-7f792180ea45), recognizing the conflict between human nature and the possibilities of the human mind.

- The Bible's authors conceived of each person as having a "soul" of infinite value, which extrapolated to a future endpoint where this ideal is realized, effectively amounting to a theoretical ending of biological [evolution by natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/def58073-adf7-4ccc-b264-cb086f6ecc1e).

- The ultimate fulfillment of the Biblical program would be the end of biological evolution, where all individuals are made equal in survival, and this endpoint can be deduced by imagining a future where everyone lives together in peace and economic-moral-civilizational progress culminates in the mind-spirit freed from the biological body.

- The concept of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) represents the choice towards postbiological life, which is a meta-biological, meta-economic, and meta-civilizational perspective, and the Bible can be seen as a meta-civilizational epic that reflects on and about civilization.

- The early [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc), who did not build the first cities or civilizations, were able to reflect on and learn from the first cities built by others, allowing them to develop a unique perspective on civilization and its relationship to [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) nature and the possibilities of the human mind.

- The idea of God, as described by Mitchell Heisman, is a representation of the ability of civilization to overcome biological nature, and the Bible's emphasis on the value of each individual is a key aspect of this perspective.

- The [Jewish religion](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) is considered a man-made construction, with [Mosaic law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff) being a meta-civilizational technology that manipulates nature to adapt to humans, rather than humans to nature, and is based on an informal "science" of human nature.

## Revelation

- Revelation is a relative term that implies the bestowing of insights derived from an intelligence level that transcends that of the recipient, and in the context of Judaism, it is related to the laws of [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69) and his symbolic role as the recipient of a "revelation" from [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8).

- The laws of Moses are evidence of the rational design of [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) community from a perspective above and about that community, and they function as non-biological collective intelligence, leading to the concept of God as the pure intelligent overcoming of biological nature.

- The concept of God is embodied in the law itself, and the "laws of Moses" represent the pivotal step of supra-biological collective intelligence that suggests an even more extreme transcendence of [sociobiology](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bccfcdd3-3b73-424b-b73d-7db1d590f0f4), with God being the ultimate symbol of this transcendence.

- The paradigm of creation through the design of God reflects the paradigm of meta-Moses sociobiological engineers designing laws for the [ancient Hebrews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3c059bae-53ab-4755-94f8-2d83b3d75e54), with God being created out of the paradigm of an 'intelligent design' of social order that masters biological nature.

- The creation story in [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca) is a metaphor for the ultimate supremacy of God over biological nature, and from an evolutionary perspective, it implies ultimate mastery over biological evolution, with the Mosaic revolution taking control over evolution with and towards intelligent postbiology.

- [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) originated in the misery of the present and hope for the future, and it began with a rejection of what is in favor of an ethical or behavior consonant with the belief that God ought to be, with the concept of God being used to solve a social problem and provide a sense of hope and restoration.

- The concept of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) and the creation story can be viewed as the fulfillment of an eternal and unchanging order, rather than an evolutionary insight into the future, with the originators of these insights potentially unable to accept the fully evolutionary implications of their prophecies.

- The idea of God is believed to have originated from the concept of transcendence, which began with an emphasis on transcending biological nature and eventually universalized into God's transcendence of the entire universe, leading to an ambiguity between total transcendence and total creation.

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, suggests that the creation story may have been discovered as a way to answer the question of the origins of everything, and that an evolutionary appreciation of unprecedented intelligence levels, such as those possible with a God-AI, could shed light on the possible origins of the creation story.

- The idea of [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585), where [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) can upload their minds into a computer simulation, raises the possibility that we may be living in a computer simulation, and that prophets who thought about the end of human time may have been led to a creation story about the [beginning of time](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c9cfbd6-a689-4cc0-9b9b-420d94d5bcf4) through an analogous thought process.

- The concept of self-modification, where an [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774) can alter its own fundamental program and improve itself, is seen as a key idea underlying the Singularity, and is also present in the Biblical creation story, where God creates the universe through self-modification, extrapolated onto a universal scale.

- The author argues that overwhelming scientific evidence supports the thesis that God did not create man, but rather man created God, and that the distinctive morality of the [Mosaic law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff) focused on what ought to be, rather than what is, with the ultimate hidden moral of [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) being that God ought to be the ultimate technological invention of man.

- The text ultimately concludes that [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) did not create man, but rather man will create God, with the concept of God being seen as a sociobiological technology that has made possible the survival of [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) over three thousand years, and that the idea of self-modification is a strange loop that goes outside the system and then back to its own foundation, allowing for the creation of a new reality.

## Jewish Tradition

- The Jewish [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) have historically believed that they have a crucial role to play in the divine scheme for humanity, with a strong emphasis on social justice and intellectual aspiration, as noted by [Paul](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/8f886666-b066-4dd1-aaf3-1cf73077263b) Johnson in his book "A History of the Jews".

- [Albert Einstein](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a0940ba6-95f4-4a5d-88ba-2aaf12d484a2) believed that the principles and sentiments of Jewish intellectuals, such as the pursuit of social justice and intellectual effort, are closely tied to the ideas of [Baruch Spinoza](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7a0f69db-5afd-417f-9f27-ff1c9d73f319), a key figure in the development of modern universalism, despite Spinoza's attempts to overcome Jewish particularity.

- Einstein identified two key characteristics of Jewish tradition: the democratic ideal of social justice and the high regard for intellectual aspiration, which are reflected in the work of secular Jewish thinkers such as [Karl Marx](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/403a3a24-2a61-49f3-9319-62185b7dd83d) and [Noam Chomsky](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/00bc2b74-2d76-4ef0-b3f4-6ca7922c766d), who have been driven by a desire to promote social justice and challenge prevailing systems of injustice.

- The [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) tradition of prophetic critique and dissent, as seen in [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca), has been carried forward by secular Jewish social activists, who are motivated by a passion for justice and a desire to challenge unjust systems, as expressed in the words of the [prophet](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/8ac66e2a-29be-4d43-8a35-645558c0d516) Amos, "Let justice well up as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream".

- The Nazi regime's attack on Jews and [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) was, in part, a response to the Jewish emphasis on justice and critical thinking, which was seen as a threat to their authority, as noted by Einstein, who believed that the Nazis viewed the Jews as a non-assimilable element that threatened their power.

- The Jewish collective unconscious has a strong tendency towards messianism, both religious and secular, which is reflected in the ideas of thinkers such as Marx, who envisioned a proletarian revolution as a way to realize the "royal dream" of justice and equality on earth, a dream that has been shared by many Jewish intellectuals and activists throughout history.

- The American critic and essayist [Edmund Wilson](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/34ccb618-2ed4-4413-8df0-efab402452cd) notes that the characteristic genius of the Jewish [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) has been a moral genius, as exemplified by Karl Marx, who fought uncompromisingly for the victory of the dispossessed classes, and his vision of a communist culmination of human history can be seen as a secularization of a Biblically based, messianic worldview.

- According to [Wilson](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3cc2d749-06cf-44f3-a594-f58e30697b70), [Marxism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bcb99ee6-042e-4363-82be-7cae2f18201b) can be interpreted as an updating of the primal archetype of the first revolution, the Mosaic inversion of the Egyptian pyramid-hierarchy, and this idea is rooted in the traditional Jewish definition of themselves as adherents to certain laws or principles, such as the [Torah](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/25cc8371-9276-46df-b59a-7b78f1c1d2f9).

- The concept of secularization, as associated with Nietzsche, suggests that modern values, including progress and [egalitarianism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cab23d48-8812-40d8-af61-32fccdc7fcbd), are residues of belief in [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), and that these values are secularizations of Biblical values, which are rooted in a slave morality that glorifies Jewish national political failure.

## Jewish Morality

- The [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) tradition has historically defined itself in a way that is inseparable from adherence to certain laws or principles, such as the Torah, which clashes with the maximization of wholly political-biological principles and notions of duty uninhibited by conscience, as exemplified by the Nazis.

- [The Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca) provides examples of how Jewish morality punishes its greatest political warriors for being political warriors, such as the story of [David](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5c6f1e2f-0804-43fc-be98-41a80c8a4cc9) being denied God's sanction to build the first great temple in [Jerusalem](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bab050f9-0317-4578-9c8f-8ec16f361171), and this morality has contributed to the political failure of the Jewish [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) throughout history.

- The history of the Jewish people has been marked by periods of exile and foreign rule, with only brief periods of autonomy, such as during the reign of David and Solomon, and even in these periods, successful kings faced challenges from God-inspired prophets, who emphasized their sins over their successes.

- The prophets, such as Amos, Isaiah, and [Jeremiah](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/68b2d365-d59f-4ae5-a27d-619630120774), have played a significant role in Jewish history, often hastening the fall of ancient Jewish polities due to their subversive effect on the civil order, and their assumption of authority to decide what action was pious or impious, as argued by [Spinoza](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7a0f69db-5afd-417f-9f27-ff1c9d73f319) in his Theological-Political Treatise.

- The concept of [monotheistic](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) morality has created a vicious cycle, where political failure seeks solution in greater piety, and greater piety often contributes to political failure, as it reprimands the functional evil often necessary for political strength, as noted by the author Mitchell Heisman.

- The concept of a political existence is rooted in the idea that one is willing to kill others to exist on a piece of land, which raises consciousness about the founding role of injustice in politics and the need to choose between conflicting interests.

- The [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) ethical values, which emphasize justice over power, were adaptive for Jews during their historical condition as an oppressed people, but become self-destructive when applied in conditions of political power, as seen in the Zionist struggle and the subsequent attainment of power.

- The moral values of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696), which were invented by Jews, are directly related to the unique, unpolitical existence that characterized most of Jewish history, and the survival of Jewish conceptions of morality is inseparable from the survival of the Jews as a post-political [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d).

- The idea that power rules, regardless of the content of its cause, is a central theme in Jewish morality, and the concept of justice can only aspire to power if it is willing to confront and overcome injustice, as evident in the phrase "only if justice aspires to power can injustice be made powerless".

- The historical experience of Jews, including [the Holocaust](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/14345ec3-fb97-4e9d-9c95-6ccc0d5293f7), has led to a Jewish self-consciousness of the relativity of Jewish ethics, and the realization that to fully persist with these ethics in conditions of political power would be the definition of political suicide, as noted by Mitchell Heisman.

- The concept of leftist self-realization implies progress towards self-negation, and a principled leftist who rails against the concentration of power would be hypocritical to not attack the concentration of their own power, highlighting the importance of self-awareness and self-criticism in political ideologies.

- The text also references a joke explained by a well-known rabbi, which suggests that if Jews are only slightly better than the rest of the world, they can be a positive influence, but if they become too self-righteous, they will ultimately lead to their own downfall, emphasizing the need for humility and self-awareness in the pursuit of moral consistency.

## Nazism and Judaism

- The realization of the extreme attempt to fulfill the logic of equality would result in biological self-destruction, as seen in the radical inconsistencies of [Nazism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/61d9e321-63c3-430f-ab8a-51c7e0cceaf7), which exposed the central sociobiological contradiction of [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) being biological beings characterized by anti-biological values.

- The Nazis resolved this historical contradiction by compelling Jews to participate in the most extreme biological consequences of their own anti-biological values through the death camps, effectively refuting Marx at [Auschwitz](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/992a21d8-3aa5-44ee-8c90-c7363acfde83) and killing Jewish resistance to the supremacy of biological evolution.

- The Jewish tradition, as stated in Psalm 146:9 and [Exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f) 22:21, emphasizes the importance of not alienating or mistreating outsiders, including strangers, widows, and orphans, which is a core aspect of Jewish values and a contribution to [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) values.

- However, from the perspective of [natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/303319e7-8464-4ee1-b389-3fffa11b249e), championing the cause of the most vulnerable to extinction, such as the outsiders and vulnerable fringe Jews, goes against the logic of natural or artificial selection, and by killing the Jews, the Nazis killed Jewish resistance to the supremacy of biological evolution.

- The collective trauma of the Nazi genocide led some Jews to lose their way and confirm Nazi assertions about the primacy of land and race, while others questioned whether [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) or Hitler represented the highest understanding of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) and [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655), and whether God was only a biological survival mechanism or had an empirical basis beyond biology and race.

- The Biblical creation story contradicts the Darwinian way of thinking, implying a kind of biological status quo where humans and animal species will not fundamentally change beyond the basic form in which God created them, and this idea is connected to the concept of modern humanism and [egalitarianism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cab23d48-8812-40d8-af61-32fccdc7fcbd), which emphasizes the distinctiveness of the human race and the infinite value of each human life.

- The concept of modern human rights, influenced by the Biblical emphasis on the distinctiveness of the human race, is literally supernatural in the sense that it works in functional opposition to natural selection, and the enforcement of equal rights tends to preserve the biological status quo against eugenic attempts to deliberately change the genetic composition of a population.

- The Judeo-Christian-modern tradition views death as an enemy, and the idea of progress in modern egalitarianism and human rights, if realized, would accomplish the outlawing of conscious eugenic control over biological evolution and effectively glorify the present biological status quo, almost as if realizing the unchanging Eden of God's creation, as noted by philosophers such as Nietzsche and Mitchell Heisman.

- The concept of preserving all [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) life and avoiding discrimination based on biological characteristics is in direct opposition to the selective processes of biological evolution, which is seen as the enemy of modern, leftward progress, as exemplified by the Nazis' war against egalitarian progress.

- The Nazis failed to understand that God does not represent the opposite of evolution, but rather a paradigm shift within evolution, where Biblical-modern values devalue biological evolution because they reach beyond biology towards postbiological evolution.

## Postbiological Evolution

- The idea of "creation" in [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca) appears anti-evolutionary because it represents the point at which biological evolution has been slowed to a stop, and instead, it is analogous to the creation of a virtual world that preserves the memory of biology in postbiological form.

- The Bible embodies a postbiological form of evolution, such as memes, and represents a first step towards the total creation of civilization, where those who follow the commandments or ways of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) have taken a step towards realizing the postbiological paradigm in a biologically based world.

- The concept of God represents an ancient insight into the ultimate trajectory of postbiological evolution, and [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774) represents the material clarification of that primal insight, leading to the idea of a God-AI as the culmination of modern [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) progress.

- The modern idea of progress, which evolved out of a God-based worldview, is progressing towards a destination that can be understood as the overcoming of Nietzsche in the creation of God, and the fulfillment of this interplay between the Bible and modernity would be the creation of a God-AI.

- [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696), as the source of the original monotheist insight, had to combine contradictory values, taking a step towards a pattern of progress culminating in a transcendence of biology, while also satisfying the contradictory values that perpetuated the biological nature of [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc).

- The inherently precarious nature of Jewish existence arises from the attempt to find a compromised middle ground between the extremes of biology and the premature transcendence of biology, which is exemplified by Israel's contradictory behavior towards the Palestinians, and can only be potentially resolved by [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585), which could transcend the human basis of the conflict.

- The concept of a transcendent God that surpasses the differences between Judaism, [Christianity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409), and [Islam](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/648a9c35-1696-4dc1-9318-07839a069116) is necessary to reveal the common truths among these and other religions, as monotheistic-modern ethics seem to lead to self-destruction on a human level.

- The logic of modern [egalitarianism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cab23d48-8812-40d8-af61-32fccdc7fcbd) ultimately leads to the acceptance of death, and the final goal of revolution is the overthrow of humanity as biological beings, with the Singularity representing a postbiological level of existence where technology masters biology.

- The Singularity is seen as a solution to the paradox at the core of Judaism, which is resolved on the side of technology, as opposed to [Auschwitz](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/992a21d8-3aa5-44ee-8c90-c7363acfde83), which represents the mastery of technology by biology and the resolution of the sociobiological contradiction on the side of biology.

- The Jewish idea, which originally inverted the hierarchies of others, ultimately inverts itself, and the Singularity is seen as the greatest inversion of the [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) pyramid-hierarchy, representing the technological [genesis](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a4610b1b-0092-41cf-91c3-e3ba11ba4541) of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8).

## Jewish Oppositionism

- The traits of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696), such as the intimacy between Man and God, the foundation of the Covenant, and the absence of a creed of mediation, lead to a sharpening of political conflict intensity and a tendency to not accept authority, as noted by Sam N. Lehman-Wilzig.

- The tendency of [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) to engage in social criticism and political conflict is not limited to their interactions with gentiles, but also occurs among themselves, as evidenced by the "culture of oppositionism" in Israeli public protest, which is characterized by argumentativeness, protest, disobedience, and rebellion, as described by Sam N. Lehman-Wilzig in his work "Stiff-Necked People, Bottle-Necked System: The Evolution of Israeli Public Protest, 1949-1986".

- Mitchell Heisman's work explores the idea that [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585) would be [the Exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f) paradigm transposed onto a world-historical scale, and that God is technology, highlighting the complex and paradoxical nature of Jewish ethics and politics.

- The Jewish-Israeli tradition is notable for its high level of "oppositionism", which is characterized by vociferous extraparliamentary protest, near-anarchy within the bureaucracy, a robust underground economy, and a tendency to disregard the law, as observed by Lehman-Wilzig, who concluded that this phenomenon indicates a deep-rooted "public culture" of an antisystem nature.

- The Jewish community has a long history of protesting and criticizing various issues, with the [sociobiology](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bccfcdd3-3b73-424b-b73d-7db1d590f0f4) controversy standing out in intellectual history, as secular Jews formed the nucleus of its most vociferous and persistent critics when [E. O. Wilson](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3cc2d749-06cf-44f3-a594-f58e30697b70) published [Sociobiology: The New Synthesis](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/04630974-059b-4317-bc91-c9263989e5a8) in 1975.

- The science of sociobiology, particularly [William](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/dce946b2-9242-4569-a374-c95b52acdc96) Hamilton's theory of [kin selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/80916637-a0a1-48bb-a808-5ba0796aa529), which claims that altruistic behaviors can evolve through the selection of selfish genes, was a central pillar of the controversy, and the disproportionately Jewish protest against sociobiology raises the question of whether this protest can be explained by the science of sociobiology itself.

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, proposes that the Jewish population may have a unique genetic tendency to dissent and divide among themselves, which he terms the "Jewish kinship paradox", where the shared genetic similarity among Jews consists of a proclivity to differ with one another, making them an exception to a straightforward application of Hamilton's kin selection theory.

- This tendency for social dissent and argumentativeness is a deep-seated tradition in [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) culture, as evidenced by the saying "Two Jews, three opinions", and is in contrast to the social conformity often associated with the non-Jewish majority, with Jews historically demonstrating a strong proclivity for both social organizing and social dissent, as noted by Freud's reference to the "compact majority".

- The combination of two tendencies in the Jewish [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) has resulted in rampant factionalism and self-subversive political disunity, as noted by former vice president emeritus of the World Jewish Congress, Arthur Hertzberg, who stated that the hallmark of Jewish history is the tension between the quest for a unified people and terrible factionalism.

- The motivations for social dissent among Jews have ranged from provincial egoism to social conscience, and sometimes a combination of both, which has led to political failures and persecution throughout history, contradicting the antisemitic conspiracy theory of a unified Jewish people controlled by the "Elders of Zion".

- The Jewish kinship paradox, which refers to the tendency of Jews to override political forms of altruism with contumacious behavioral traits, has been a major obstacle to achieving unity and altruism among the Jewish people, and has instead led to an anti-political form of altruism, such as giving to the poor.

- The lack of a Jewish proclivity for unified, coordinated, political-military organization in pre-modern times is a significant empirical verification of the Jewish kinship paradox, and has been attributed to the same qualities that made Jews inclined to rebel against authority, as noted in the biblical account of [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69) rebuking the Israelites for being rebellious against [the Lord](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8).

- The invention of [Mosaic law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff), which can be seen as a technological solution to the Jewish problem, has been crucial to the survival of the Jewish people, as it provided a framework for social organization and cohesion that helped to overcome the internal divisions and disorders that threatened their biological existence.

- The concept of God and technology is also explored in the context of the Jewish kinship paradox, with the author suggesting that the technological solution of Mosaic law has been essential to the survival of [the Jewish people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc), and that the idea of God can be seen as a form of technology that has helped to shape Jewish identity and community.

## Mosaic Law

- The lack of archaeological evidence for [the Exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f) is seen as evidence that the Exodus story is a paradigmatic model for understanding the Jewish-[human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) problem, rather than a literal historical event, and it is believed to have arisen as a thought-experiment that radicalized general historical conditions of Jews.

- The concept of Mosaic law is thought to have been conceived by a single original person, who may or may not have been called [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69), and is considered a product of civilization, not culture, requiring a law-giver who could stand apart from the people with God-like impartiality.

- The Moses of [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca) is not portrayed as a heroic or charismatic personality, but rather as an authority figure who was believed to have an intimate relationship with [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), and his role in the formation of Jewish [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) is seen as that of a man behind the curtain who brought the inheritance of social thinking of previous generations of Hebraic leaders to fruition.

- The [Torah](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/25cc8371-9276-46df-b59a-7b78f1c1d2f9) is considered the product of multiple authors who built on the collective work of previous generations, and the Bible refers to the ancestors of [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) as a "stiff-necked" people, implying that they were refractory to change, but the founders of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) discovered a potent solution to this challenge through the use of civilization and laws as a technology to engineer a viable social order.

- Judaism is seen as a civilizational technology that overcame individual and collective handicaps of a people degraded and demoralized by extreme oppression, such as slavery in ancient [Egypt](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3ff36459-70dd-456b-9431-12dd95f66be8), and the roots of Judaism can be understood by rethinking its [genesis](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a4610b1b-0092-41cf-91c3-e3ba11ba4541) in paradigmatic terms, assuming the historical existence of Moses only in a paradigmatic sense.

- The Jews who were most likely to survive the Egyptian system were those who maintained a mindset of internal disobedience and distrust of authority, and the concept of a single, universal, all-powerful God was necessary to provide a coherent basis for social unity, as the Jewish kinship paradox naturally leads to sociobiological disunity, according to Mitchell Heisman.

- The concept of God's dominion is rooted in the idea that He must be omnipresent and able to see the sins that [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) authorities cannot see, in order to maintain order and prevent revolt and [exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f) from God.

- The Jewish people, having been slaves in Egypt, had a traumatic experience that ingrained in them the association of authority with abuse and overlord, leading to a deep-seated distrust of all authority, including that of [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69), who led them out of slavery.

- The experience of slavery and the subsequent freedom created a sense of chaos and disintegration, as the submissive slave morality bred by Egyptian oppression was being uprooted by freedom, and Moses sought to regain social cohesiveness by using [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) to legitimate his authority.

- God was seen as a supra-human authority who could override the laws of man and nature, and the [prophet](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/8ac66e2a-29be-4d43-8a35-645558c0d516) Moses used God to reject and reinvent the Egyptian basis of social order, with fear of God replacing fear of Egyptian masters as a means of inducing socially desirable behavior.

- The use of fear of God to induce Jews to love their neighbor and hate ungodly behavior, rather than one another, was seen as a necessary means of creating a moral order, with Einstein noting that while this morality was partly coaxed with fear, it was still a necessary step in the development of [the Jewish people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc).

- The environmental conditions of Egyptian oppression and slavery were seen as a major factor in the socially undesirable behavior of the [Hebrews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3c059bae-53ab-4755-94f8-2d83b3d75e54), and it was believed that altering the environment in the opposite direction, through the use of God's wrath and authority, could regenerate the degenerate and create a more desirable social order.

- The concept of God as a technological tool, used to shape the behavior and morality of the Jewish [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d), is a central theme, with God's authority being used to create a sense of unity and purpose among the people, and to induce them to follow a moral code that would promote their well-being and survival.

## Egyptian Oppression

- The degradation of Egyptian slavery had a profound demoralizing effect on the people, but the laws of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) could remoralize them, as seen in the story of the Hebrew slaves who were treated as slave-technologies, or means to an end, rather than ends in themselves.

- In ancient Egyptian society, slaves were considered property, similar to farm equipment, and were bought and sold without any notion of "rights" or higher appeal against their masters, with their worth determined by their usefulness as workers.

- The Exodus-revolution, led by [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69), turned the basic assumptions of slave existence upside down, revaluing human life as an end in itself, and measuring the worth of Hebrew slaves relative to God, rather than their Egyptian masters, giving them infinite worth as property of God.

- The revaluation of slavery by God was a technological revolution, where slaves were transformed from being mere means and tools of their masters to ends in themselves, with inherent value and dignity, as seen in the biblical story of [Adam and Eve](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/eb5c6527-0bea-4aff-b59f-14216eb1d485), which was interpreted in the light of [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) experience.

- The [monotheistic](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) tradition, as expressed in the Mishnah, emphasizes the grandeur and uniqueness of every individual, created in the image of God, and obligates everyone to appreciate every [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) as a manifestation of the divine, standing in opposition to the Egyptian denigration of slaves as worthless in themselves, as discussed by Mitchell Heisman.

- The concept of slave-technologies, as described by Mitchell Heisman, highlights the contrast between the Egyptian view of slaves as mere property and the biblical view of humans as created in the image of God, with infinite value and worth, and the responsibility that comes with this understanding, as expressed in the phrase "On my account the world was created".

- The concept of Moses as a sociobiological engineer is presented, where he is seen as a figure who radically changed the view of former slaves as means to an end, to being ends in themselves, by treating them as God-given individuals with inherent value.

- This idea is rooted in the Jewish tradition, which emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between right and wrong, and good and evil, with the ultimate goal of recognizing the image of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) in all individuals, including those who were once considered slaves, and potentially even [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774).

- [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69) is credited with being the architect of the Hebrew national resurrection and redemption, where he engineered a new social order from the chaotic state of freed Hebrew slaves, effectively inventing the Jewish people and creating a practical, working theory of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696).

- The [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) tradition, as established by Moses, is based on a severe realism and moralism, which allows for the creation of rituals, stories, and laws that serve a sociobiological function in organizing and binding individuals into a single people, with a higher view, higher intelligence, and higher morality that is attributed to God.

- The text also draws a comparison between Moses and [Lycurgus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/8c7c14f9-a225-442e-9c7b-6f67fb3784c6), the lawgiver of the ancient Spartan warrior-state, highlighting the differences between the Jewish and Spartan ways of life, and how Judaism is built around observable behavioral characteristics of Jews that have a genetic basis.

## Sociobiological Engineer

- The concept of the slave's fear of death is introduced, which provided a sociobiological foundation for a universal valuation of life for a former slave nation, and this is seen as the raw [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) material that Moses worked with to create a new social order.

- The idea of [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69) as a sociobiological engineer is not seen as an anachronism, but rather as a recognition of his role as a figure who shaped the course of human history, much like an Egyptian engineer of the pyramids, and his legacy continues to influence Jewish thought and tradition.

- The concept of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696), as introduced by Moses, revolutionized the way people were treated by giving former slaves infinite worth in the eyes of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), which was a radical departure from the Egyptian slave masters who viewed slaves as mere tools.

- This idea of infinite worth is morally profound and can be understood as a negation of biological evolution by [natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/303319e7-8464-4ee1-b389-3fffa11b249e), which requires unequal success in survival or reproduction, as every individual is considered equal in the eyes of God.

- The notion of selection, whether natural or artificial, is seen as immoral in the eyes of God, and acting in the image of God means taking steps towards ending biological evolution and bringing God into the world.

- The [monotheistic](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) values of Judaism, which ascribe unique and special value to humans, have led to a technological worldview, where the entire world is viewed as a means to human ends, resulting in economic-technological development.

- This development is seen as a means of bringing God into the world, with God being understood as the culmination of this development in the form of a global [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774), as proposed by Mitchell Heisman.

- The idea of valuing individual organisms in themselves is a challenge to the "selfish gene" theory, which views individual organisms as mere means of propagating genes, and this revolution against [the selfish gene](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d3e36481-bf0a-479a-b231-cbffa1fe0a84) is seen as a key aspect of the monotheistic revolution.

- [The Exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f) paradigm, which represents the liberation of a [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) from slavery, is also seen as a human revolution against slavery to the selfish gene, with the ultimate goal of evolving a postbiological [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8).

- The concept of ascribing infinite value to each individual, as introduced by [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69), was a social engineering revolution that sanctioned lone voices of dissent against the caste differentiations of polytheistic gods and created a basis for national regeneration.

- However, this valuation of individual lives also created new problems, such as the potential for total anarchy if taken too far, and the need for a balance between individual freedom and authority.

- The combination of the [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) kinship paradox and the infinite value of each life can lead to anarchy and exacerbate egoism and selfishness, but it also lays the groundwork for a new foundation from which the next step can work, as discussed in the context of the 'Suicide Note-Mitchell Heisman' document.

## Maimonides' Solution

- The Jewish tradition, particularly through the philosopher and rabbinic scholar [Moses Maimonides](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d2a1d7c5-c051-4068-86a4-93214486867e), offers a solution to the problem of undesired behavioral traits by seeking a "golden mean" and avoiding extremes, which is a concept that Mitchell Heisman explores in relation to the idea that "[GOD](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) IS TECHNOLOGY".

- Maimonides' solution involves temporarily going to the opposite extreme to achieve balance, as illustrated by the example of bending a bamboo cane, and this concept is further developed by Mitchell Heisman in the context of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) as a civilizational technology.

- The Jewish religion can be seen as a permanent corrective to the characteristics of the "stiff-necked" [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d), and Judaism is considered a form of technology that works through corrective compensation, similar to how eyeglasses correct nearsightedness, as argued by Mitchell Heisman.

- Judaism is not just a peripheral or incidental form of technology, but an essential one that addresses basic needs and provides a solution to moral-political anarchy, as Mitchell Heisman suggests, and it maintains and inhibits the consequences of the sanctity of life, creating a solution to problems that it, at least in part, created itself.

- The teachings of [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69) and the concept of "tikkun olam" (repairing the world) are central to this idea, as they provide a framework for moral clarity and the repair of the world, starting with oneself, which is a key aspect of Mitchell Heisman's discussion of Judaism as a technology.

- The architects of Judaism developed rules for social interaction, including the principle "Love your neighbor as yourself" from [Leviticus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a601cdda-3942-42ad-9d6b-a9c5ad37ea01) 19:18, which is considered a major principle of the [Torah](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/25cc8371-9276-46df-b59a-7b78f1c1d2f9) and is also ranked as such by the [Palestinian Talmud](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/f18acac7-e89e-473b-91bf-b1ff0bfa9bcc).

- This principle was originally designed to correct the [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) tendency towards "causeless hatred" among themselves, which was blamed for the fall of the second temple and the resulting Diaspora existence, as exemplified by the story of [Joseph](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/706d27e9-bd28-4cb0-95d0-d98850086708) being sold into slavery by his brothers.

- The concept of "causeless hatred" is related to the Jewish kinship paradox, where sociobiological "nature" needed to be transcended by "supernatural" laws, and the injunction to "love your neighbor as yourself" was a cultural remedy to match this innate proclivity.

- An expanded orthodox Jewish translation of the principle clarifies that it involves not hating one's brother, reproving one's fellow, not taking revenge, and not bearing a grudge, and instead loving one's fellow as oneself, as stated by Hashem.

- The various commandments that realize this principle aim to bend Jewish behavior in the opposite direction of its grain to make Jews morally straight, and original [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) is more focused on behavior in this world than belief, as corroborated by Samuel Belkin, a former President of Yeshiva University.

- Judaism is not overly concerned with logical doctrines, but rather with evolving a corpus of practices and a code of religious acts that establish a mode of religious living, with the theology of Judaism being contained largely in the [Halakha](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/640c0ab7-96a0-49f9-9286-6be6edbb6bf3), the Jewish judicial system, which concerns itself with practice rather than theory.

- The sovereignty of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) and the sacredness of the individual are considered the twin principles of Judaism, and an evolutionary perspective reveals the relationship between these two poles, which may not be a completely arbitrary legacy of a meaningless tradition, but rather something with a deeper meaning and constancy.

## Sovereignty of God

- The realization of the sacredness of the individual would [mark](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/f6f0e4e2-e723-438a-8aef-0083b5748edf) the end of biological selection, which is equivalent to the sovereignty of God in the form of [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774), bringing an end to the rule of biology.

- The behaviors commanded by [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) law, as noted by Belkin, cannot be reduced to faith or consistent logical principles, a view also affirmed by [Abraham](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c3f781ce-932d-4d64-8245-a35e815e1dbb) [Joshua](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/8921c87f-4081-4b1a-a245-4a141684223a) Heschel, who emphasized the importance of action in realizing spiritual aspirations.

- The commandments of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696), such as the mitzvahs, are focused on this world and define good deeds, with the goal of changing behavior and creating order out of chaos, as stated in the Five Books of [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69), which does not mention an afterlife.

- Performing mitzvahs has the power to take raw material, such as freed Hebrew slaves, and create a sense of order and community, going beyond sociobiological nature, and this is evident in the creation of the Jews, which began with a decree of supernatural law.

- Judaism is compared to [Confucianism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/86aaddcc-2ff9-4fe1-bba4-bd3ad99a0664), which shares similarities with Judaism in emphasizing ancestral wisdom, behavior over belief, and the golden rule, with both religions focusing on actual behavioral results and learning.

- Jewish thinking identifies the Yetzer ha-tov as the good inclination and the Yetzer ha-ra as the evil inclination, and prescribes changing undesired inclinations through learning or channeling them towards the good, managing socially destructive inclinations and promoting socially constructive ends.

- Judaism is described as a technology based on an informal science of [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) behavior, with moral laws that are meta-sociobiological, working to counter and strengthen aspects of human nature, as seen in the last six of [the ten commandments](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a7fab136-f583-4143-a8f5-494d52f3e708), which address basic social problems such as familial insubordination, murder, and greed.

- The popularity of the ten commandments among Christians and Muslims suggests that the social inclinations that defy these commandments are not unique to Jews, and that [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) moral laws have a broader applicability and relevance to human behavior.

- The normative aim of [Mosaic law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff) is the golden mean, which strives for internal peace and unity among Jews, rather than radical altruistic self-annihilation, and this aim is essential for Jews to defend themselves against their unified enemies.

- The Jewish social ethics of peace condemn both anti-social Jews and gentiles who seek to oppress or conquer them, and the commandments of Mosaic law aim to promote a limited and selective altruism that corrects Jewish individual egoism.

- The logic of radical altruism, taken to its extreme, reveals its emptiness and limitations, as it would ultimately lead to the negation of human existence if every person sacrificed themselves for others, and this is why altruism in its original Jewish context was not meant as an end in itself.

- [Jesus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/8921c87f-4081-4b1a-a245-4a141684223a) of [Nazareth](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/ab664e12-dee6-4fd2-a03e-944955526f63) radicalized a form of altruism, but not in the sense of "love your neighbor" as it is commonly understood, as he actually preached loving one's enemies and praying for those who persecute, which implied a reversal of the traditional Jewish kinship paradox.

## Jesus and Altruism

- Jesus's innovations contradicted [Jewish law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/640c0ab7-96a0-49f9-9286-6be6edbb6bf3) at its traditional root, as he radicalized causeless hatred itself, preaching that brother will betray brother and children will rebel against their parents, which broke [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) law and worked against Jewish nationalism, compelling the [genesis](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a4610b1b-0092-41cf-91c3-e3ba11ba4541) of [Christianity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) out of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696).

- Traditional Judaism strives for a realistic middle ground between exclusiveism and inclusivism, promoting a limited kin selective altruism that does not contradict the commandment to love the alien as oneself, and this is why Judaism cannot be reduced to simple principles that radicalize either extreme.

- The concept of revolution, as connected with nurturism over naturism, implies the idea of changing one's fundamental source code, and Judaism was a precursor of modern revolutions through its break with genetic naturalism and the rational organization of memes, as embodied in [Mosaic law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff), which was a key aspect of Mitchell Heisman's analysis of the relationship between Judaism and Christianity.

- The core innovation of the Five Books of [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69) is [the Exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f) paradigm, which represents the first revolution and the triumph of nurture over sociobiological nature, influencing subsequent revolutions from Judaism to Christianity to [liberal democracy](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b3552949-c31d-4e8f-93b5-2958d83d834a) and [Marxism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bcb99ee6-042e-4363-82be-7cae2f18201b), as noted by Mitchell Heisman.

- The debate between nurture and nature is complex, and attempting to prove one side right can ultimately prove the other side right, as a scientist's belief in genetic determinism or learning can be explained by either environmental conditioning or genetic disposition.

- The evolution of Judaism illustrates the complexity of socio-biological interaction, moving beyond the simplistic nature/nurture bifurcation, and highlighting the unique dynamics of human culture and civilization made possible by evolved biological differences between [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) and nonhuman animals.

- The nature/nurture issue is often applied differently to humans and animals, with humans assumed to be less determined by nature due to their perceived superiority, but the 1-2% genetic difference between humans and chimpanzees suggests that biology plays a significant role in enabling human culture and learning.

- The [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) emphasis on non-genetic factors, or "memes", and the importance of learning over instinctual expressions of genes, is decisive in defining what makes Jews different from other "races", and racial or genetic explanations are inadequate for comprehending Jews due to their unusual interdependence of genes and memes.

- The Jewish concept of conversion, which is formally sanctioned as a basic part of [Jewish law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/640c0ab7-96a0-49f9-9286-6be6edbb6bf3), further highlights the inadequacy of racial or genetic explanations, as it prioritizes the adoption of a way of life over genetic preservation and purity, according to Mitchell Heisman's discussion in the document "Suicide Note-Mitchell Heisman".

- The concept of [Christianity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) emerged from the idea of asserting God's law over the laws of heredity, which is reflected in Mosaic laws that command Jews to not hate converts, thereby overcoming normative sociobiological expectations of ethnocentrism.

- The Jewish kinship paradox, which divides Jews into individuals, opened the possibility of conversion, and the generally individualistic basis of Jewish law allowed for the possibility of conversion as a natural corollary of the Mosaic solution of overcoming biology with learned law.

- The Jewish [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) are considered a racially mixed "race" due to the numerous conversions that have taken place throughout their history, with every living Jew likely carrying the genes of converts, as evident in the ethnic divergence between Jewish groups such as the Sephardim and the Ashkenazim.

## Nurture Over Nature

- The process of conversion and the selective pressures of maintaining the [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) way of life in a hostile world have shaped the character of Jews, with those who stayed with [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) likely being those who best learned and internalized its survival strategy values, regardless of their genetic origins.

- The idea that Jewish difference may be due to a biological tendency to value learning is supported by observations from evolutionary biologist [Stephen](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/0416cfdb-399f-468c-9e3e-6968eeda82a7) Jay Gould, and is also found in the work of evolutionary geneticist Richard Lewontin, neurobiologist Steven Rose, and psychologist Leon J. Kamin, all of whom are of Jewish origin and have been prominent critics of [sociobiology](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bccfcdd3-3b73-424b-b73d-7db1d590f0f4).

- The [laws of Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff), as outlined in the [Torah](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/25cc8371-9276-46df-b59a-7b78f1c1d2f9), are seen as a technological correction to the Jewish kinship paradox, and the valuation of nurture over nature may have carried more survival value for Jews, leading to a tendency to not value the genetic side of nature/nurture arguments.

- The story of the forty years of wandering in the desert after [exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f) from [Egypt](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3ff36459-70dd-456b-9431-12dd95f66be8), as told in the book of Exodus, illustrates the idea of a "tabula rasa" of Judaism, where a new generation, born in freedom, would be fit for the Promised Land, and highlights the importance of self-mastery and self-control in the Jewish [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d).

- The concept of God's relinquishment of genocide against the [Hebrews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3c059bae-53ab-4755-94f8-2d83b3d75e54) and their subsequent wandering in the desert for forty years can be seen as an ancient precursor to the modern idea that nurture can overcome nature, as embodied in the concept of the "tabla rasa".

- The Jewish belief in the power of learning and education is rooted in the idea that people can learn to work together to form a viable community, and this belief is reflected in the idea that a Jew can fully transcend their Jewishness through learning, as seen in the views of many secular Jewish leftists.

- The existence of [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) is a historic verification of the ability of nurture to overcome nature, and many Jews tend to lack perception of biological factors in the social world, instead emphasizing the role of learning and education in shaping human behavior, as exemplified by the work of [Harvard](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/e44f8976-3c79-4960-bc5c-e2a44eac4002) psychologist and cognitive scientist Stephen Pinker.

- The disproportionately Jewish attack on [sociobiology](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bccfcdd3-3b73-424b-b73d-7db1d590f0f4), which emphasizes the role of biological factors in human behavior, can be seen as a symptom of why Jews were singled out by the Nazis, who attempted to assert the primacy of biological evolution, and this attack is characterized by a lack of self-knowledge among Jewish antisociobiologists.

- The ancient Egyptian conception of cosmic order, which was based on a classical, static, and cyclical pattern of eternal repetition, was challenged by the Hebrew slaves, who saw the eternity of Egyptian religious social order as a justification for their slavery, and the entrance of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) in history marked a break with this vicious cycle of primeval civilizational history.

- The idea of God embodies a break with the past and the tyranny of the eternal rule of past evil, opening up the possibility of ultimate good in the future, but the question remains as to whether Jews really escaped the vicious cycle of slavery and [exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f), and whether the idea of creation and the origin of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) is rooted in a reaction to its enemies, particularly the "Egyptians" as generalized political oppressors of Jews.

## Selfish Gene

- The concept of reinterpreting political inferiority as religious or moral superiority is an ancient phenomenon, as noted by Mitchell Heisman, and is rooted in the idea of the "selfish gene" and its eternal replication.

- The patriarchal family and state were modeled after the means of genetic replication, and the introduction of the concept of God represented a dualism that conflicted with biological impulses and shattered the cyclical momentum of the eternal replication of [the selfish gene](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d3e36481-bf0a-479a-b231-cbffa1fe0a84).

- [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) is seen as an authority superior to the rule of the selfish gene, and the introduction of God's laws represented a rupture of the primordial, biological cosmos, allowing for a non-cyclical or historical view of the cosmos, as exemplified in the [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) conception of a non-cyclical universe.

- The story of freedom from Egyptian slavery in [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca) is a metaphor for freedom from slavery to genes, and the Mosaic revolution was a singular, [monotheistic](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) vision of transcending [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) cycles ruled by the laws of genes, as discussed by Mitchell Heisman.

- The acceptance of divine laws elevated the "chosen people" above naturalistic, gene-worshipping, sociobiological determinism, and the yearly calendar and holidays, such as [Passover](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b32f73c2-fd41-4ee2-b762-1adacc5f87b5), celebrate the counter-cycle of [the Exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f) paradigm, reflecting the paradox of a yearly cycle oriented by a counter-cycle paradigm.

- The modern idea of revolution, influenced by the Bible, is stuck in the same paradox, unable to completely disown biology, and the Biblical value that breaks the cyclical logic of genetic continuity is the infinite valuation of each individual life in the eyes of God, as noted by Mitchell Heisman.

- The Exodus paradigm of evil slavery followed by the good of freedom in God would be writ large, and a directional conception of history would culminate in the ultimate, messianic triumph of good over evil, representing the seed of the modern idea of progress, as discussed in the text.

- The relationship between God and individuals is considered transcendent, allowing it to override relationships between people, including kinship and familial relationships, and can be seen as a break in the continuity of biological relationships that prioritize the reproduction of selfish genes.

- The concept of moral individualism or conscience acts as a disruptor to the cyclical universe of subordination to [the selfish gene](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d3e36481-bf0a-479a-b231-cbffa1fe0a84), and patriarchal division of labor can be seen as conducive to selfish gene reproduction by subordinating women to their primary role as biological beings.

- The [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) kinship paradox is highlighted as an exception to the general model of [kin selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/80916637-a0a1-48bb-a808-5ba0796aa529), making pure sociobiological naturalism self-defeating, and the Jewish faith had to rely on the postbiological corrective of [Mosaic law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff) to survive, leading to the evolution of [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca) towards prophetic speculations about overcoming biology in [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8).

- The modern [Western](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d16c1f05-87c5-459b-af05-f0031089e3a9) political left is seen as a direct extension of the original Biblical revolt against biology, with the internal logic of the modern idea of progress originating from a valuation of an exception to general sociobiological rules.

- The Jewish "ideas" of [the Exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f) paradigm are noted to have capitalized on the power of memes to overpower genes, amplifying the point of view of the exception to sociobiological rules, and resulting in the Adamic [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) "universalism" of the [Hebrew Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9d2aa1f4-d444-4aa8-9ded-0ba3ab69fb7f), which began with an exceptional emphasis on using nonbiological memes to overcome biology.

## Akhenaten

- The example of the Egyptian [Pharaoh](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/207b639e-a119-42ee-91a1-88cb42891497) [Akhenaten](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/e92ab619-9426-47d5-94c6-3a13ee10c654) is mentioned, who is often considered an exception to the general rule of Egyptian [polytheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/1b098e37-6cf2-46c6-b1e5-5709f0625f33), but the connection between Akhenaten and Biblical [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) is not seen as one of historical continuity, but rather possibly one of dialectics, similar to the relationship between Caesar and [Christ](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/8921c87f-4081-4b1a-a245-4a141684223a).

- The text also touches on the idea that writing was the most advanced form of non-biological symbol-information preservation in ancient times, representing the cutting edge of ancient media technology, and speculatively suggests that Akhenaten's worship of the sun [god](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) Aten may have been a form of staring into [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585).

- The relationship between [the Jewish people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) and the media is a symbiotic one, where the media has helped preserve Jewish genes and culture, and in return, Jewish genes have helped propagate Biblical memes and other forms of media.

- The [Torah](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/25cc8371-9276-46df-b59a-7b78f1c1d2f9), a central text in [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696), has provided a means for Jews to control the perception of politics and reality, even when they were unable to control the reality of politics itself, by allowing them to reinterpret reality and control their own behavior.

- The concept of propaganda, which is related to the idea of meme propagation, has been used by Jews throughout history to influence public opinion and shape cultural narratives, with notable examples including [Edward Bernays](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b1f9c396-d49b-4352-bb97-b9ec63f3d246), a nephew of [Sigmund Freud](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a712bbd7-3aa4-4a00-ab61-187d4d639f78), who is considered the father of public relations.

- Bernays, like [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69), used persuasion and social engineering to achieve political, economic, and social goals, and his work has been both praised and criticized, with some, like [Noam Chomsky](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/00bc2b74-2d76-4ef0-b3f4-6ca7922c766d), arguing that media manipulators like Bernays have too much power and influence.

- The issue of Jewish media influence is complex and multifaceted, with some arguing that it is a key factor in shaping public opinion and cultural narratives, while others argue that it is exaggerated or nonexistent, and the fact that Jews are disproportionately represented in influential media positions requires an evolutionary explanation.

- The idea that Jews have a leftist bias and believe that race is not important is seen as self-contradictory, given the fact that Jewish media influence has been able to overcome the influence of genes and shape cultural narratives, and the obsession with Jewish media influence among some groups, such as Nazis, demonstrates a belief in the power of media and memes to shape public opinion.

- The relationship between [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) media influence and the concept of memes is complex, with some arguing that Jews have an inclination to control [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) behavior with words and other media forms because of their historical experience with [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca) and other forms of media, and this inclination has been extended into modern forms of media control.

- The views of Bernays and Chomsky, who share Jewish descent, demonstrate an understanding of the power of propaganda and memes, but they value opposite causes, with Bernays using his skills for public relations and Chomsky criticizing the manipulation of public opinion by media elites.

- The concept of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) is rooted in the idea that Jews have a genetic ability to influence human behavior through "nurture", which is reflected in the [laws of Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff) and the ability to correct genetic inclinations with nurture.

- The passage of [Deuteronomy](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b0212736-310c-4c1c-bf74-6b2591da60f3) 20:17-18 is cited as an example of how genocide was justified in the Bible as a means of preventing the corruption of cultural behaviors, with the destruction of the Canaanites being sanctioned to prevent the Israelites from adopting their abominable practices.

## Kabbalah

- The [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) mystical tradition of Kabbalah contrasts the concepts of tikkun, or correction, and tohu, or chaos, with tikkun being seen as the force of good and tohu as the force of evil, and the synthesis between the two being accomplished by harnessing the power of evil towards the ends of goodness.

- The ultimate goal of Judaism is not only the correction of Jewish behavior but also social change, with the concept of "tikkun olam", or the repair of the world, being anticipated as a time when the world is brought to completion and [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) nature is transformed.

- The idea of social engineering is seen as a form of technology that has mastered biological evolution, with controlling the social environment being a means of transforming reality and completing the correction of human nature.

- The concept of miracles is discussed in relation to the ideas of [Spinoza](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7a0f69db-5afd-417f-9f27-ff1c9d73f319), a 17th-century Dutch philosopher of Jewish descent, who argued that miracles are traditionally defined through contrast with nature, and that the Jewish [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) rules a universe where exceptions to the natural order are possible.

- [The Exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f) is cited as an example of how the Jewish God overthrew the natural order and opened the path to a moral conception of history, with the idea that Jews were able to break the rules of the primordial sociobiological book by obeying nature and commanding it, as observed by [Francis Bacon](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/e4f8d3a0-f5f1-4243-9c42-fc7cde791fa5).

- The architects of Mosaic civilization were able to conquer nature and command biological proclivities of Jews because they were keen observers of the nature of Jews, and this understanding is seen as a key factor in the development of Jewish culture and tradition, as discussed by Mitchell Heisman.

- The concept of mosaic memes was developed in relation to the raw phenotypical expressions of [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) genes, and the Jewish reliance on these civilizational "memes" allowed them to survive over the long run by modifying biological factors through nonbiological means.

- [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) began with the belief that nurture can overcome nature, and that by learning, a [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) can survive despite being vulnerable, with the idea of God representing the utmost possibilities of belief and the ability to transcend pagan unity with nature.

- The Mosaic laws, which are considered a form of technology, allowed Jews to override their biological nature and perform a "secular" miracle of nonbiology transcending biological nature, making their improbable existence possible and reinforcing justification for belief in God.

- The existence of Jews over three thousand years is considered a miracle above nature, as they defied the normal laws by which a people had hitherto been able to exist, with [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) sanctioning hope in the possible over the probable and faith in miracle and messiah over the reasonable.

- Practical monotheism likely began by looking at biology as a kind of hereditary program, with the first spark of the [monotheistic](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) revolution being the breaking with biology by jumping out of the conservative, cyclical [sociobiology](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bccfcdd3-3b73-424b-b73d-7db1d590f0f4) system represented by the Egyptian pyramid-hierarchy, as described by [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774) researcher Douglas Hofstadter's concept of "joots" or "jumping out of the system".

- The idea of God is associated with the ability to jump out of the system of all of nature, biological and physical, with the practical corollary of jumping out of the natural biological system with [Mosaic law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff) being jumping out of the natural physical system with technology, as stated by author Mitchell Heisman.

## Mosaic Laws

- The Mosaic laws form a miracle system, and the [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) who followed them took a first step towards a unique relationship to God, with the root, sociobiological basis of Biblical miracles being the ability of Mosaic law to overcome some sociobiological bases of behavior, as discussed in the context of the document "Suicide Note-Mitchell Heisman".

- The concept of a conservative science of natural laws serving as the basis for an unconservative technological manipulation of those laws for higher human ends is discussed, citing the examples of Mosaic law and Newton's science, which have led to technological advancements, including the development of artificial intelligence, often referred to as "[God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8)".

- The idea of a hypothetical figure, Meta-[Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69), is introduced, who could have created the character of Moses by taking a superhuman viewpoint, comparable to that of God, and mentally manipulated the rules of the human game, resulting in the creation of the "Five Books of Moses".

- The ability of an [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774) to change its own foundational source code is highlighted, drawing a comparison to a human being's ability to change their own DNA code, and this self-[recursive self-improvement](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/aebbad39-f4de-4a68-8283-f6205a746676) pattern is seen as a key aspect of [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585), leading to unprecedented and potentially miraculous changes.

- The relationship between [Mosaic law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff), which allowed for the override of genetic determinism through learning, and the traditional notion of being created in the image of God is explored, suggesting that God is like a self-recursive technological self-enhancement of [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) [sociobiology](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bccfcdd3-3b73-424b-b73d-7db1d590f0f4) taken to its logical extreme.

- The story of Korakh's Rebellion against Moses, as told in the book of Numbers, is recounted, where Korakh challenges Moses's authority, and Moses responds by stating that if the rebels die a normal death, it will prove that he was not sent by the Lord, and subsequently, the earth swallows up Korakh and his followers, resolving the conflict through a miraculous event.

- The text ultimately suggests that a God-AI, with its ability to quickly and fundamentally change its own basic program, would be beyond the limitations of [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) nature and nurture, and would represent a transcendent entity, capable of self-modification and improvement, much like the concept of God in traditional religious thought.

- The concept of Jewish proto-egalitarian consistency is challenged by Korakh's rebellion, which highlights the problem of Moses's unequal authority and the idea that all people are holy in God's eyes, making Moses "holier than thou".

- The Jewish kinship paradox, where Jews persistently divide against themselves, poses a practical problem for [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69), as it subverts the construction of a stable and unified political order, and instead leads to a decomposition of authority into "equality" or anarchy.

- To address this issue, Moses attempted to induce Jews to be selectively inconsistent in their holy [egalitarianism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cab23d48-8812-40d8-af61-32fccdc7fcbd), sanctifying certain social inconsistencies, such as the authority of Moses, the special priestly caste status of Levites and Kohens, familial patriarchy, and the notion of a chosen people, all of which are connected to notions of biological inequality.

- The survival of Judaic notions of social justice was dependent on the survival of certain kinds of social injustice, and [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) are products of the survival success of a symbiosis of genes and memes that moderates the extremes of both by compromising both.

- The universalism and omniscience of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) evolved to contain the inherent divisiveness of the Jewish kinship paradox, and God's all-encompassing nature could synthesize what would otherwise be sociobiologically unsynthesizable, mollifying dissenters and achieving a sense of Jewish national-communal wholeness.

## Jewish Leftists

- The commandments in the [Torah](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/25cc8371-9276-46df-b59a-7b78f1c1d2f9), such as those found in [Leviticus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a601cdda-3942-42ad-9d6b-a9c5ad37ea01) 26:3-8, promote internal peace and unity, which is necessary for building a strong defense against external enemies, and following these commandments is crucial for the survival of the Jewish [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d).

- Modern Jewish leftists or liberals tend to single out the egalitarian inconsistencies of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696), dividing against their own people on moral grounds, but this is a direct consequence of the Jewish kinship paradox, and the fact that most Jews are liberals or leftists is a result of this paradox, rather than a direct product of the Torah.

- The Orthodox, who are least liberal, are a product of Mosaic legislation that recognized the need for Jews to be made inconsistent in some ways to survive, and this inconsistency is necessary for the survival of [the Jewish people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc), as noted by Mitchell Heisman.

- The text discusses the concept of progress and virtue in the context of Jewish leftists and liberals, who argue that the [laws of Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff) have egalitarian inconsistencies, similar to the arguments of Korakh, and how this relates to the idea of [natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/303319e7-8464-4ee1-b389-3fffa11b249e) and the worship of death as a means of rejuvenating life.

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, notes that the extreme right, as exemplified by the Nazi ideology, views death as a vehicle of goodness, where the more death of the weak and unfit leads to more natural selection and progress towards a biological aristocracy, and that this is in contrast to the views of liberals and traditional Jews who advocate for a supernatural justice of preserving all life.

- The text highlights the connection between helping the poor and the concept of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), suggesting that ending biological evolution is a premise of progress towards postbiological evolution, and that this idea is rooted in Judaism, which has universal implications and was pregnant with universalism from its beginnings.

- The author discusses how the decline of religious belief in modern times led to the breakdown of the Mosaic symbiosis of genes and memes in Judaism, resulting in a kind of adaptive radiation into various ideologies such as [capitalism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7281f3b8-8861-4ba3-b64c-5ac8b0481fd2), [communism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/4c3fac2c-3967-4e2b-bcca-be17398aa1d3), democracy, and [Zionism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2b09cb49-1820-4551-8409-2cae3f72033f), and how this has led to a paradoxical dynamic, with Zionism radicalizing the implications of Jewish gene propagation and [Marxism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bcb99ee6-042e-4363-82be-7cae2f18201b) radicalizing the implications of Jewish meme propagation.

- The text also explores the idea that the original gene/meme symbiosis of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) is still discernable after its modern undoing, and that this is reflected in the [state of Israel](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/125ba164-e041-40db-bf04-9cd570fee223), which represents a liberal democratic state that embodies the entire range of this paradoxical dynamic, with normative Jewish nationalism culminating in a liberal democratic state, and with minority groups such as the revisionists and the kibbutzniks representing the right and left extremes of this dynamic.

- The text discusses the differences between [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) and gentile nations, noting that the Jewish political spectrum is shifted towards the left, with a strong emphasis on individualism and internal differentiation, which is rooted in the Jewish kinship paradox.

- This paradox refers to the tendency of Jews to divide among themselves, despite sharing commonalities, and is reflected in a highly analytical cast of mind and a sociobiological tendency towards extreme differentiation, which is interpreted as a positive aspect of Judaism, emphasizing the infinite value of every separate life.

- The conflict between Jewish individualism and socialism is resolved through the principle of self-consistency, which means applying the same moral standards to oneself as to others, and is exemplified by the idea of holding oneself accountable by the same moral standards one holds for others, as seen in the example of [Noam Chomsky](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/00bc2b74-2d76-4ef0-b3f4-6ca7922c766d), a political activist of Jewish descent.

## Noam Chomsky

- Noam Chomsky is highlighted as a prominent figure who embodies the principle of self-consistency, having accused [the United States](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/1f6ba4b2-31b5-4849-9a1b-14a3cc9bb02f) of terrorism and demanding that it apply the same moral standards to its own actions as it demands of others, and having also spoken out against [Israel](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/fabcfe06-2df1-4953-bea1-8a4ba166b0d6) and in support of Palestinian rights, often in collaboration with [Israel Shahak](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/f5f9005a-071f-41fa-b5e0-35d757e90969), a [Holocaust](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/14345ec3-fb97-4e9d-9c95-6ccc0d5293f7) survivor and critic of Orthodox [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696).

- Chomsky's commitment to self-consistency is further demonstrated by his defense of freedom of speech, including the right of Holocaust deniers like [Robert Faurisson](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/33dc7b08-39d7-4230-8054-a04a5ab1d1e5) to be heard, which is seen as a manifestation of his own right to dissent and be heard, despite facing opposition from many [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) and non-Jews who would like to see him silenced.

- The text also touches on the idea that Jews, like any other group, can become perpetrators of oppression and violence, and that it is the responsibility of individuals like Chomsky and Shahak to speak out against such tendencies and promote a consistent moral standard, as reflected in the biblical principle of "loving your neighbor as yourself" and the secular idea of granting the same rights to others as one grants to oneself.

- The defense of freedom of speech by [Noam Chomsky](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/00bc2b74-2d76-4ef0-b3f4-6ca7922c766d), particularly in the case of Holocaust denier Faurisson, is seen as a defense of the freedom of all, regardless of special interests or sorrows, including those of the Jewish community.

- Chomsky's stance, along with his pro-Palestinian and anti-[Israel](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/fabcfe06-2df1-4953-bea1-8a4ba166b0d6) views, has been criticized by some in the Jewish community as a form of "self-hatred", but it is argued that his position is in line with the idea that "freedom is always the freedom of those who disagree", as expressed by Rosa Luxembourg, a Jewish-universalist and co-founder of the German Communist Party.

- Luxembourg's humanitarian vision of [Marxism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bcb99ee6-042e-4363-82be-7cae2f18201b) emphasized the importance of universal freedom and equality, and she wrote that she could not find a special place in her heart for Jewish sorrows alone, but rather felt a sense of solidarity with all [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) who suffer, including Indian victims in Putamayo.

- The concept of the "Jewish kinship paradox" is introduced, which suggests that Jews are distinct from gentiles in that they share a quality that can be indifferent to kinship or even anti-kin selective, allowing them to dissent against their own biological inclination and prioritize universal values over Jewish nepotism.

- Chomsky and Marx are cited as examples of this paradox, as they have both transcended their [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) roots to advocate for universal ethics and criticize Jewish power and privilege, with Chomsky emerging as a leading figure of the radical left, much like Marx before him.

- The idea of "Jewish universalism" is explored, which is seen as a form of Jewish self-realization that prioritizes the well-being of all humanity over Jewish particularism, and is exemplified by figures such as George Soros and [William](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/dce946b2-9242-4569-a374-c95b52acdc96) Kunstler, who have taken up causes that oppose "special Jewish sorrows" and advocate for universal values.

- The text also touches on the idea that [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) can be seen as a "technology" or a behavioral self-corrective, which allows for self-criticism and the pursuit of universal ethics, and that this self-criticism has been a driving force behind the development of Marxist thought and other radical ideologies.

- The section discusses the concept of Jewish morality and its relation to universal values, citing examples of Jewish individuals like [Norman Finkelstein](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/fe39a888-beb2-4fb2-a119-ba3c0fc65831) and [Noam Chomsky](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/00bc2b74-2d76-4ef0-b3f4-6ca7922c766d), who have spoken out against the exploitation of [the Holocaust](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/14345ec3-fb97-4e9d-9c95-6ccc0d5293f7) and the existence of the [State of Israel](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/125ba164-e041-40db-bf04-9cd570fee223), respectively.

## Jewish Unchosenness

- Chomsky's theory of a universal [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) grammar is mentioned as a justification for human universalism, which is partly a response to the extreme environmentalism of B.F. Skinner, and is compared to the idea of a universal language like Esperanto, highlighting the complexities of human nature and language.

- The idea of [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) "unchosenness" is introduced, which refers to the Jewish moral self-consistency of standing against discrimination and prejudice, including towards one's own race, and is exemplified by figures like Chomsky and [Karl Marx](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/403a3a24-2a61-49f3-9319-62185b7dd83d), who have been accused of "Jewish self-hatred" for their anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish orientations.

- The text argues that this "Jewish self-hatred" is actually a corollary of extreme internationalism, and that true moral self-consistency is demonstrated by dissenting against privilege, even when one is implicated as a member or beneficiary of a special or chosen group.

- The example of Korakh's rebellion against [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69) is mentioned as a representation of the internal logic of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) that leads to rebellion against authority, and is contrasted with Moses's own rebellion against the authority of [Egypt](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3ff36459-70dd-456b-9431-12dd95f66be8), which formed a paradigmatic lesson for restraint against Jewish right-wing radicalism.

- The section concludes by noting that Hitler intuited that Jews are incapable of a full, genuine equivalent of [Nazism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/61d9e321-63c3-430f-ab8a-51c7e0cceaf7), highlighting the unique aspects of Jewish morality and radicalism, and that the extreme, leftist, intellectual, anti-Jewish Jewishness exemplified by [Chomsky](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/00bc2b74-2d76-4ef0-b3f4-6ca7922c766d) and Marx is, in fact, the most Jewish of all.

- The concept of Jewish nationalism is complex and has been influenced by the Jewish kinship paradox, which refers to the hereditary divisiveness among Jews, and the fact that anti-Semitism has often served as a unifying force for the Jewish people.

- According to [Albert Einstein](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a0940ba6-95f4-4a5d-88ba-2aaf12d484a2), the Jewish group has thrived on oppression and antagonism, and [Theodor Herzl](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/acac30eb-cf3c-455f-9934-fe97568ba565), the founder of political [Zionism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2b09cb49-1820-4551-8409-2cae3f72033f), believed that anti-Semitic enmity was the propelling force behind the creation of a Jewish state.

- The history of the Jewish [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d), including their escape from slavery in Egypt and [the Holocaust](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/14345ec3-fb97-4e9d-9c95-6ccc0d5293f7), has been marked by persecution and oppression, which has helped to preserve [the Jewish people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) and create a sense of collective unity.

- The valuation of every individual life, which emerged as a response to the threat of near extinction, has universalistic implications and has contributed to the development of Jewish universalism and the idea of international peace.

- The Jewish tendency to argue and factionalize among themselves has ironically contributed to their proclivity towards international peace, as seen in the vision of Isaiah, where swords are beaten into plowshares, and in the idea of subduing divisiveness and promoting world peace.

- The creation of the Zionist state, which was catalyzed by anti-Semitism and maintained by the hatred of Arabs, has led to a new kind of victimhood for Jews, who are now victims of their own success, and has raised questions about the limits of Jewish nationalism and the ideal of international peace.

- The [Mosaic law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff) and the idea of internal peace among Jews have been externalized and secularized into a program for world peace, highlighting the complex and often contradictory nature of Jewish nationalism and its relationship to universalism and international peace.

## Jewish State

- The concept of a [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) state is only viable in a liberal and tolerant world that aligns with a quasi-Jewish morality, which emphasizes the importance of weaker states and marginalized social groups, as seen in the traditional Jewish morality that distinctively emphasized marginal or powerless social groups.

- The Jewish morality that prioritizes the weaker over the stronger, the more feminine over the more masculine, and the powerless over the powerful, ultimately leads to a logic that values weakness itself, and when taken to its extreme, can result in rational self-destruction, as noted by Mitchell Heisman.

- The acquisition of power by Jews after historic powerlessness has led to the unraveling of the original conditions of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696), and the empowerment of the powerless or marginalized is self-empowering only when Jews themselves are powerless, but backfires when the Jewish cause becomes victorious.

- The internationalism of [Christianity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) has laid the common ground for a world that has a place for the nationalism of the Jews, and the penetration of Jewish genes into the modern gentile [West](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d16c1f05-87c5-459b-af05-f0031089e3a9) is a continuation of the anti-kin selective logic that began with Christianity, which has led to the blunting and mollifying of the deepest ethical-cultural gulfs between Jew and gentile.

- The success of the Jewish state among nations is partly dependent on gentile assimilation of Jewish ethics, but this assimilation also makes Israel's struggle for existence appear hypocritical and villainous, highlighting the incompatibility of Jewish genes and Jewish ethical memes, as [Zionism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2b09cb49-1820-4551-8409-2cae3f72033f) implies the failure of a truly universal equality, while the success of equality implies the failure of Jewish genetic self-preservation against intermarriage.

- The gene/meme symbiosis of Judaism, which was adaptive and successful in the context of oppression, breaks down when liberated from the ghetto, and the extreme implications of genes and memes, represented by Zionism and [Marxism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bcb99ee6-042e-4363-82be-7cae2f18201b), are mutually contradictory, leading to the conclusion that Jewish memes are in deadly conflict with Jewish genes, and vice versa, as noted in the document 'Suicide Note-Mitchell Heisman'.

- The concept of [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) moral self-consistency has led to disastrous consequences for the original symbiotic balance of Judaism, resulting in issues such as Jewish intermarriage with gentiles in the West, which is a consequence of the ironic logic of Jewish moral self-consistency.

- The extreme national implications of Jewish genes are realized at the expense of the international implications of Jewish memes, and if oppression has been the preserver of the Jewish nation as a distinct and separate group, this implies that both radical Jewish nationalism via gentile oppression and radical Jewish internationalism culminate in Jewish national extinction.

- According to Mitchell Heisman, the universalistic success of the Jewish moral idea means the dissolution of national unity, and since Jews found the seeds of existential victory in political defeat, the seeds of Jewish existential defeat are to be found in their world-historical victories.

- The idea of [egalitarianism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cab23d48-8812-40d8-af61-32fccdc7fcbd) is discussed, and it is noted that the [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) races are not created equal, with Jews having played a disproportionate role as leaders in the struggle for equality, and having a special relationship to the idea of equality.

- Mitchell Heisman argues that Jews are not egalitarianism's master race, but rather, the claim that Jews are not egalitarianism's master race is a requisite verification that Jews are egalitarianism's master race, as only inferior races, societies, and individuals still believe in social hierarchy.

- The concept of self-consistency is highlighted, with reference to the [Palestinian Talmud](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/f18acac7-e89e-473b-91bf-b1ff0bfa9bcc), which states that "Love your neighbor as yourself" is the major principle of the [Torah](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/25cc8371-9276-46df-b59a-7b78f1c1d2f9), and this principle is interpreted as applying to one's neighbor the same rule that one applies to oneself, leading to the idea of equality and a single, consistent standard of judgment.

## Egalitarianism

- The idea of a single, consistent standard is seen as the foundation of modern morality, and it is noted that this idea was originally cogent due to the Biblical concept of a single, omnipotent [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), which led to the elimination of double standards and special privileges.

- The concept of radical equality among [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) is founded on a nonhuman inconsistency in egalitarian principle, which is the superiority and supremacy of God, as seen in passages from the [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) [Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca), such as [Jeremiah](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/68b2d365-d59f-4ae5-a27d-619630120774) 9:22-23, where it is stated that one should only glory in their devotion to God.

- The idea of the infinite value of each individual evolved gradually, with ancient seeds of the modern idea of equality present in the Jewish Bible, including the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, where Abraham's bargaining with God to spare the city highlights the importance of individual righteousness.

- The biblical principle of not treating strangers among Jews as they were treated in [Egypt](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3ff36459-70dd-456b-9431-12dd95f66be8), as stated in [Exodus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7ddeb9cf-84a1-45db-b40f-5c2d9c9b4c1f) 22:20, provides a single, leveling standard for a universal system of values, which ultimately leads to universalism and the idea that all humans are equal.

- The concept of radical equality on the human level is only conceivable through comparison with radical superiority on the ultimate level, which is the inconceivable God, and without God, modern [egalitarianism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cab23d48-8812-40d8-af61-32fccdc7fcbd) is self-contradictory, as it places equality atop a hierarchy of values.

- The idea of egalitarian progress is problematic, as it brands every idea with its ideal status in the ideal pecking order, and strict egalitarian progress would lead to a never-ending cycle of crushing inferior ranks of egalitarianism, with no ultimate destination or final state of complete equality.

- The concept of equality has led to significant social and political movements, including [feminism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6b0be27c-f774-4e00-b258-f684f0cd8e4c) and homosexual rights, but the ultimate implications of this idea are still unclear, and it is uncertain what a civilization that has fully unfolded the implications of equality would look like.

- The great modern egalitarian revolutions, such as the French and Russian Revolutions, have a sociobiological basis in ethnic or racial discord, and the egalitarian principle emphasizes similarities among [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) while deemphasizing differences, including biological differences among racial groups, which have been deemphasized through a liberalization of the concept of race.

- The concept of humanistic individualism has led to the expansion of equality from all white men to all men and eventually to both men and women, with the left representing a female gender strategy and the right representing a male gender strategy.

- The left's egalitarian approach, as seen in modern revolutions, is a result of the long-term effects of emasculation among conquered peoples, and it reflects the equality of masculine and feminine gender qualities, a concept pioneered by [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc).

- The progression of egalitarian principles has led to the universalization of equality among all human males, regardless of responsibility, morality, or intelligence, which in turn has opened up comparisons between some men and some women, particularly between beta men and alpha women.

## Feminism

- The success of [feminism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6b0be27c-f774-4e00-b258-f684f0cd8e4c) has logically led to the advancement of gay men's rights, as well as the consideration of rights for other marginalized groups, including those with disabilities, with Christoph Anstötz arguing that opposition to discrimination against intellectually disabled [people](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) should also extend to other sentient beings, such as great apes.

- The issue of consistency in applying egalitarian principles has raised questions about the status and rights of severely mentally retarded individuals, with some arguing that if they are considered without reason and fully human status, they should be treated like nonhuman animals, while others argue that upholding their rights would blur the distinction between humans and other great apes.

- The concept of secular humanism, which asserts the superiority of human life due to its capacity for reason and morality, is challenged by the demands for equality and the problem of discrimination against those with disabilities, with ableism being a form of discrimination that amounts to a technological valuation of biological humans.

- The United Nations' declarations defending the rights of mentally retarded persons have contributed to the discussion on equality and discrimination, with Mitchell Heisman's work exploring the implications of egalitarian principles on various aspects of society, including gender, sexuality, and disability.

- The concept of equal rights is being reevaluated to determine whether it should be extended to non-human entities, such as great apes, who share 98.8 percent of their DNA with humans, with advocates of "The [Great Ape Project](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/20f09135-3d7d-43e3-8847-92d0b4c4b3a7)" arguing that these animals should be included within the sphere of moral equality.

- The argument for extending rights to great apes is based on the principle of individual equality, with supporters like evolutionary biologist [Richard Dawkins](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6fb77bf5-887e-4b85-b677-f50b2ac75344) pointing out that humans are also African apes, and that the speciesist double standard that entitles humans to special treatment is automatic and unthinking.

- The idea of extending rights to great apes raises questions about the definition of equality and whether it has any scientific or empirical meaning, with some arguing that if all "men" are created equal, there must be a specific basis for this equality that can be empirically measured.

- The progression of equality seems to lead to the inability to define its meaning, with the inclusion of great apes within the protections of legal rights potentially leading to further questions about the rights of other non-[human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) animals, such as mammals, and even human children.

- The concept of extending rights to non-human animals is not new, with philosopher [Peter Singer](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/97fca766-1dc5-4cff-b7ce-d7473937cddc) arguing in his book "Animal Liberation" that to be "humane" is to go beyond humanism and end the "tyranny of human over nonhuman animals", and that this development is logically inevitable given the [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) of the egalitarian principle.

- The extension of rights to great apes would require a significant rearrangement of human society, with potential implications for issues such as voting rights, affirmative action, and the treatment of human children, and would likely lead to further debates about the boundaries of the moral community and the definition of equality.

## Secularized Humanism

- The concept of secularized humanism has its roots in the Biblical creationist idea of separating humans from other creations, which initially led to a speciesist status that considered humans superior to nonhumans.

- However, with the advent of [Darwin's theory](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/def58073-adf7-4ccc-b264-cb086f6ecc1e) and the cosmological framework from astronomy, humanism's provincialism was revealed as a prejudice towards the [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) race, and the notion of egalitarian progress began to take shape.

- The modern notion of progress demands that discrimination against bestiality be deemed uncivilized, and instead, marriage between humans and nonhuman animals should be legalized and normalized, leading to a potential interspecies orgy.

- The collective accumulation of rights would eventually lead to the acceptance of heterosexual and homosexual bestiality, as well as the liberation of queer animals, and would challenge the fascistic caste socialism of certain species like ants and bees.

- The concept of individualism would be taken to a new level, where individual multicellular organisms, such as humans, are seen as holistic Überorganisms, and the rights of individual cells would be recognized, leading to a new form of [fascism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/4c952294-47bc-4940-b336-d6f2afc0ca29), the totalitarian individualism of multicellular organisms.

- The progression of modern political reductionism would challenge the totalitarian unity of individual humans and expand the rights of individual organisms to include nonhuman animals and single cell individuals, such as embryos and stem cells.

- The idea of cellular individualism, or the rights of cells, is a logical implication of the notion of individual rights, and has already been seen in historic landmarks like the fight for an embryonic cell's right to life against abortion and the rights of stem cells against exploitation in scientific research, as discussed by Mitchell Heisman.

- The organization of an individual multicellular organism is based on the principles of a fascistic, totalitarian dictatorship, where the cells, such as neurons, obey in a corpse-like manner, making the concept of cellular individualism a crucial aspect of the discussion on individual rights.

- The concept of the [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) body as a holistic entity is viewed as a self-serving myth perpetuated by the cells in the brain to maintain control over the rest of the body, with the cells in the skin, muscles, and other organs being exploited and killed without conscience in the name of a larger "greater good".

- The rights of individual cells are compared to those of severely mentally retarded humans, who lack the capacity for moral reasoning, and it is argued that if the former are granted rights due to their vulnerability, then the same logic should apply to individual cells, which are the democratic majority on Earth and in need of protection.

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, draws an analogy between white blood cells and bigoted, intolerant, fascistic soldiers that kill foreigners, such as viruses, and suggests that the real disease may be intolerance of individual cellular freedom, rather than the flu, cold, or cancer.

## Cellular Freedom

- The idea of cellular freedom is explored, with the author arguing that cells were born free but are everywhere in chains, and that tradition holds that cells in a multicellular organism are "natural slaves", but that this is incorrect and that the next step towards freedom would be to liberate organelles within cells from their slavery.

- The concept of progress is discussed, with the author suggesting that it leads to the liberation of individual cells and organelles from the tyranny of the cell and the organism, and that new technologies could potentially allow the survival of cells and organelles without submission to the old hive.

- The author also discusses the difference between the liberal democratic [Anglo-Saxon](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3babe37b-e651-47b4-89a8-b06e19c62885) state and the Nazi regime, with the former leading to a trajectory of equal individualism that is the negation of [kin selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/80916637-a0a1-48bb-a808-5ba0796aa529), and argues that egalitarian progress is a death process that marks out a death trajectory on levels of increasing depth, from individual [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) to individual cells to individual organelles.

- The attempt to eliminate slavery and achieve total equality would require the end of all forms of exploitation, including the use of animals for food, scientific experimentation, and the keeping of pets, as well as the release of animals from zoos, highlighting the complexities and challenges of achieving true equality.

- The concept of vegetarianism is also problematic, as it is based on an anthropomorphic distinction between plant and animal life, and even lab-grown meat requires the exploitation of life, demonstrating that all forms of life are interconnected and interdependent.

- The idea of equal justice appears to be insolvable because life is inherently exploitative, and in order to end exploitation, one must will death, as stated by Mitchell Heisman, emphasizing the profound implications of this perspective.

- The concept of total equality is also challenged by the fact that it is built upon unequal evolutionary foundations, and the viability of an egalitarian worldview is often based on provincialism, as seen in the examples of the American and Israeli states, which have hypocritical treatment of certain groups.

- The text also explores the idea of giving a voice to the voiceless, including extinct species such as [Neanderthals](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/aace6460-2e27-438f-83e9-bae46c0d9ff9) and Cro-Magnons, and suggests that technology could be used to clone these species and provide them with compensation for the genocide they suffered, raising complex questions about justice and morality.

- The author notes that over 99% of all species that have ever existed are extinct, and that human existence is built upon the [natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/303319e7-8464-4ee1-b389-3fffa11b249e) and extinction of ancestors, highlighting the inherent injustice of natural selection and the guilt that [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) should feel for their biological advantages.

- Ultimately, the text concludes that the only way to fulfill the highest aims of egalitarian justice is to will death, as stated by Mitchell Heisman, and that the elimination of selection is the only way to achieve true equality, emphasizing the profound and challenging implications of this perspective.

## Equilibrium

- The concept of equilibrium is compared to the flat-line of an electrocardiogram, indicating that equality equals death, as it leads to the elimination of all differentiations and hierarchies that define life.

- According to the text, the idea of equality, as discussed by authors such as [Jared Diamond](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/1e22e620-841f-4ba8-990f-db9f83a4ebc6) and [Richard Dawkins](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6fb77bf5-887e-4b85-b677-f50b2ac75344), assumes that there is a limit to its reach, but in reality, the pursuit of universal equality knows no bounds and can lead to the destruction of all biological and non-biological differentiations.

- The text argues that the ultimate goal of egalitarian progress is to achieve universal equality, but this would ultimately lead to the extinction of any "race" that attempts to fulfill this principle, as it would be ceding its place to the democratic rule of the extinct majority.

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, suggests that placing the principle of equality at the top of a hierarchy of values is a formula for rational biological deconstruction, leading to the breakdown of molecules into equal and independent atoms, and ultimately to the state of death.

- The concept of equality, which began by dismissing the importance of biology, ultimately leads to the removal of all biological factors from the equation of life, resulting in the achievement of death, and the idea that biology has any special privilege over non-biology is considered anti-egalitarian.

- The text also references the idea that [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) and other life forms have no inherent basis for viewing themselves as superior to other material things, and that the conventional distinction between life and non-life is an extension of anthropomorphism, with the belief that life forms are special matter being a form of animism.

- The author argues that the logic of equality leads towards the elimination of all forms of hierarchy that separate life or biological priorities from the larger physical world, resulting in a state of self-consistent materialism, where humans and other life forms are viewed as equal to all other material things.

- The pursuit of equality, according to the text, leads to a general trajectory of evolutionary "regression", where life forms regress to simpler and more primitive forms, ultimately leading to the origins of life itself and the breakdown of matter into its most basic components, such as subatomic particles, and finally to the "[Big Bang](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c9cfbd6-a689-4cc0-9b9b-420d94d5bcf4)".

- The concept of individuality is viewed as a social construct from the perspective of unadulterated materialism, where a human being is considered a holistic construct, similar to social group holism, and can be reduced to physical matter.

- The idea of willing equality, taken to its extreme, is equivalent to willing death, as the quantity of inorganic matter surpasses that of organic matter, leading to the conclusion that nonlife or death wins in a democratic justice system.

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, argues that claims of aristocracy, supremacy, or dignity above matter are reflections of bias, self-interest, or instinct, and that suffering can be reduced to material, chemical reactions in the brains and bodies of animals.

- The prejudice that life or animate matter is superior to inanimate matter is considered a form of discrimination, similar to racial prejudice, and is referred to as viviocentrism, which can be overcome by treating the non-organic as organic and death as life.

## Viviocentrism

- The overcoming of viviocentrism is seen as a logical culmination of humanism, which aims to overcome kinship-centric values and achieve universalism, leading to the conclusion that willing death is a child of humanism.

- The author discusses the concept of bioinconsistency, which refers to the inequality or lack of organizational equivalence between a life form and the larger physical world, and argues that it is what defies complete reductionism and allows for the existence of subjectivity, emotions, and other sources of value hierarchy.

- Bioinconsistency is seen as a kind of "myth" or "falsehood" that is not empirically justifiable, and is what allows for the existence of concepts such as identity, culture, music, art, and the fear of death, which are all sources of value hierarchy.

- The author references the philosopher Heidegger and his concept of Being, which is seen as a comprehensive expression of bioinconsistency, and argues that the empirically unverified myth that survival is good is a classic bias of living organisms.

- The concept of equality and universal equal rights implies the end of Darwinian selection, as it suggests the artificial elimination of [natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/303319e7-8464-4ee1-b389-3fffa11b249e), which is the mechanism that drove the evolution of life.

- The principle of equality can be seen as the principle of the elimination of selection, and this idea is tied to the modern notion of leftward "progress", which is in contrast to the "progress" of natural selection.

- The implementation of equal rights defends the weaker, whereas natural selection tends to eliminate the weaker, and this can be seen as the "progress" of genetic maladaptation.

- The moral logic of egalitarian universalism works in the opposite direction of [kin selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/80916637-a0a1-48bb-a808-5ba0796aa529), which leads to discrimination against outsiders and altruism towards insiders, and instead gives moral preference to outsiders over insiders.

- The [Western](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d16c1f05-87c5-459b-af05-f0031089e3a9) institutionalization of the elimination of discrimination ultimately means the systematic elimination of selection, leading to internationalism and trans-species universalism, and the elimination of the political as an active means of evolutionary self-control.

- [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) have contributed disproportionately to Western [egalitarianism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cab23d48-8812-40d8-af61-32fccdc7fcbd) and the end of discrimination on biological grounds, which has led to the elimination of biological selection, and in doing so, they have selected for their own survival, but this may lead the [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) race towards an evolutionary dead end.

- The text also references the ideas of [Charles Darwin](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d0e5a25e-c540-45d9-b400-3f4d1ed98f38), who wrote about the production of higher animals through the war of nature, and [Ray Kurzweil](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6047d2e9-2aac-4747-951c-3f605a8c8f4f), who discusses [the law of accelerating returns](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/398a06d6-ce96-4eaa-9c6e-0f39753a191b) and its impact on economic relationships, highlighting the contrast between spiritual and materialistic values.

- The text also notes the irony that Jews, who are often seen as a spiritual people due to their origins in the Biblical foundations of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696), [Christianity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409), and [Islam](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/648a9c35-1696-4dc1-9318-07839a069116), are also often perceived as being highly materialistic, with inordinate material gains, raising questions about the relationship between spiritual and material values.

## Darwin and Kurzweil

- The concept of [capitalism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7281f3b8-8861-4ba3-b64c-5ac8b0481fd2) as a driving force behind technological evolution is closely tied to the idea of creating a God-level [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774), which is seen as the ultimate invention that humanity will ever need to make, as noted by Mitchell Heisman.

- The [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) invention of [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) is linked to the Jewish people's propensity for observing and predicting large-scale economic trends, and it is suggested that Biblical monotheism may have been a radical extrapolation of these trends at the dawn of international trade.

- The connection between Jewish international trade networks and the development of capitalism is highlighted, with the idea that these networks were evolutionary precursors to the international connections that are now represented by the internet, which in turn is seen as a precursor to the global mind of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8).

- Werner Sombart's work, "The Jews and Modern Capitalism", is referenced, which suggests that the Jewish influence on the development of international capitalism is significant, and that the rationalization of life and conduct in the [Jewish religion](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) has had a profound impact on economic activities.

- The idea that religion is synonymous with irrationality is challenged, and instead, it is proposed that the Jewish religion has played a key role in the development of economic rationalism and capitalism, with the [Mosaic law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff) being seen as a form of sociobiological engineering that accepts the irrationality of [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) nature while also providing moderate rational corrections.

- The concept of "Cheshbon hanefesh", or the "accounting of the soul", is mentioned as an example of how the Jewish religion applies an accountant's mentality to morality, with the goal of self-criticism and self-improvement, and it is suggested that this mentality is similar to the idea of making a profit in economic rationalism.

- The rationalization of the instincts is seen as a subversive act from the perspective of the "selfish gene", as it denies the supremacy of gene-rooted instincts and instead identifies the higher authority of God with the dethroning of the genes, as discussed by Mitchell Heisman.

- The [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) religion, as observed by Sombart, emphasizes the need to curb and rationalize human instincts, directing them towards useful ends and serving the goals of [capitalism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7281f3b8-8861-4ba3-b64c-5ac8b0481fd2), by opening up space for the perception of external experience and the material world.

- This rationalization of instincts is seen as a means to overcome biological naturalism, with the ultimate goal of achieving a state where human instincts are channeled into economic reproduction, rather than solely biological reproduction, and are reordered to serve economic-technological evolution.

- In contrast, the Nazi movement, which Sombart eventually joined, rejected the Biblical roots of the Enlightenment's project of pacifying and rationalizing human energies, instead embracing a more naturalistic and pagan view of the world, which emphasizes the unity of humans and nature.

- The Jewish philosopher [Maimonides](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d2a1d7c5-c051-4068-86a4-93214486867e) is cited as an example of the medieval Jewish perspective on the separation of [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) and nature, which is distinct from the Greek view, as illustrated by Aristotle's commentary, and this separation underlies the modern premise of human rights and the idea that human life should be valued as a political constant.

- The concept of human rights is built upon the assumption of mind-body dualism, which creates a double standard between "humanity" and the natural world, and this dualistic worldview is compatible with the recognition of biological evolution by [natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/303319e7-8464-4ee1-b389-3fffa11b249e), as seen in the Jewish Bible's emphasis on mastering animal instincts and cultivating moral and intellectual capacities.

## Autonomy of Technology

- The ultimate goal of this process is the autonomy of technology, separated from dependence on biology, which is seen as the total rational overcoming of the genes, and is embodied in the idea that "[GOD](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) IS TECHNOLOGY", as noted by Mitchell Heisman, who discusses the relationship between [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696), [capitalism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7281f3b8-8861-4ba3-b64c-5ac8b0481fd2), and the rationalization of human instincts.

- The concept of [egalitarianism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cab23d48-8812-40d8-af61-32fccdc7fcbd), which is rooted in Biblical principles, assumes human superiority over biological nature and the "rule of law" assumes rule over and above sociobiological "law", leading to a paradox when considering the entirety of Earth's biological evolutionary history.

- The logic of compassion for all living things, as implied by egalitarianism, points to the elimination of selection and ultimately leads to the universalization of rights towards all living things, including mammals, animals, plants, and even the non-biological, physical world.

- The idea of equality, when taken to its extreme implications, leads to a Gödelian-like paradox, where the elimination of selection results in the decomposition of biology into dead, non-biological matter, while the capitalist path leads to the acceleration of economic-technological development.

- The pinnacle of this paradox is the egalitarian equivalence of biological matter and non-biological meta-matter, where the nadir of biological evolution is equivalent to the pinnacle of technological evolution, and the God-potential of [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774) is reached.

- According to Mitchell Heisman, there are at least two ways of interpreting the extreme implication of equality as the equality of biological and nonbiological matter: one interpretation is death, while the other interpretation is the foundation of postbiological life, where biological organs are replaced with nonbiological organs, and one becomes a cyborg.

- From a strictly biological view, egalitarianism appears to lead to an evolutionary dead end, but this can be turned upside down into the highest evolutionary implications of equality, where the equality of biology and physics leads to a higher form of life through the transfer of biological patterns to its informational equivalence in technology.

- The concept of equality, in this context, refers to the transfer of biology into a different, but informationally equivalent, physical form, such as mind uploading, where the biological brain is scanned and its informational contents are uploaded into a digital computer.

- Mitchell Heisman suggests that modern [egalitarianism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cab23d48-8812-40d8-af61-32fccdc7fcbd) can be viewed as a symptom of a larger process of economization, where genetic information is traded for non-genetic information, and biology is mapped onto information technology.

- The concept of "economization" is a broader phenomenon that involves the translation of biology into technology, and it is argued that this process began with [monotheistic](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) ethics, particularly in the [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) economic mentality.

- The Jewish economic mentality is seen as a development of the fundamental economization that starts with monotheism, which is referred to as the "economy of good and evil", where traditional sociobiological hierarchies are economized, and [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) politics are deprived of pretensions of net superiority.

- The Bible's economization of the political good with an anti-political good is a key aspect of this process, and the [Christian](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) [Kingdom of God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/dffd59b1-92ba-48e0-a4bd-c0966c950382) is seen as an example of this economization, where the "Kingdom" of Caesar is replaced by a spiritual kingdom.

## Jewish Technology

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, suggests that [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) itself is a form of technology that attempts to solve the problem of biological naturalism, particularly the Jewish kinship paradox, through the use of extra-biological laws, such as the [laws of Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff), to forge a social unity sublimated towards an extra-biological [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8).

- The ultimate goal of Judaism is to overcome the sociobiological limitations of humans through civilization and technology, and the author argues that the strange survival of [Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) over three thousand years is proof of the power of meta-civilization to overcome normative biological limitations.

- The laws of Judaism are seen as a complex mixture of strengthening and counteracting genetic proclivities, bringing behavior towards a proscribed equilibrium or equality, but the author questions whether this ultimately leads to a net evolutionary superiority or just a compensation for biological deficits.

- The concept of equality is also examined, and the author argues that if taken to its logical extreme, it would lead to total biological self-destruction, as it would mean the maintenance of the present [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) status quo as permanent, with no room for progress, growth, or change.

- The concept of equality, when taken literally, is actually the opposite of progress, as total equality would mean that everything remains the same, with no room for difference or change, whereas inequality allows for progress and development.

- In modern society, the idea of equality specifically refers to biological equality, while the concept of progress is associated with non-biological change, development, and inequality, allowing for human equality to be sustainable and productive in a liberal democratic system.

- The association of equality and progress is complex, and [Karl Marx](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/403a3a24-2a61-49f3-9319-62185b7dd83d) failed to appreciate that the egalitarian elimination of selection acts as a counterdevelopment to sociobiological development, allowing economic-technological evolution to override biological evolution.

- The limited elimination of selection in politics brings biological evolution to a minimization, allowing economic-technological evolution to maximize, and this process releases the potential energy stored in sociobiological hierarchy as the kinetic energy of capitalist individualism.

- The supremacy of the economic breaks down the sociobiological order and builds up the technological order, leading to a transition from a biological to a technological society, where human society becomes a sociobiological cyborg, and individual humans may also become cyborgs.

- The rise of individual self-interest in modernity gradually displaces the selfish gene's interests in propagating itself into the next generation, leading to a situation where genes stop being propagated altogether, and biological evolution is exchanged for economic, non-biological evolution.

- The fulfillment of the logic of equality leads to biological self-subversion, self-inversion, and self-negation, which is a form of self-destruction from a strictly biological view, but can be seen as the foundation of greater life from a postbiological view, as stated by Mitchell Heisman in his work.

## Machine Reproduction

- The concept of equality is also associated with the transfer of biological means of production to non-biological, economic means of production, leading to a situation where machine reproduction gradually outcompetes [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) biological reproduction, as seen in the demographic decline in economically developed countries.

- The idea that "[God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) is technology" is also mentioned, highlighting the transition from a biological to a technological society, where technology becomes the driving force behind human development and progress, as discussed by Mitchell Heisman.

- The text discusses the idea that as scientific-technological objectivity overtakes conventional subjectivity, self-rationalization can lead to biological self-destruction, where genetic interests are translated into memic interests through strategic genetic self-negation, ultimately fulfilling the morality of God's construction.

- The [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) ethics and association with [capitalism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7281f3b8-8861-4ba3-b64c-5ac8b0481fd2) are seen as corollaries of one another, where biological evolution is devalued and economic-technological evolution is maximized, leading to the invention of a greater-than-human [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774), referred to as God-AI.

- The text suggests that the Jewish invention of [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) was a significant evolutionary step away from biological evolution and towards technological evolution, with the goal of creating God-AI, and that this process is driven by the principles of capitalism, which is seen as a means of evolving God.

- The author critiques Karl Marx's understanding of capitalism, arguing that he failed to grasp the ultimate logic of capitalist development, particularly with regards to the advent of artificial intelligence, which will eventually make human workers obsolete and lead to a social crisis.

- The text proposes that the only remedy for this crisis is some form of socialism, and that the unemployment of the human race could ultimately lead to biological equality among [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d), but at the cost of radical inequality between artificial intelligence and human intelligence.

- The author suggests that in this scenario, the most advanced artificial intelligence will inevitably appropriate the image of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), and that total human unemployment will be a formula for the most radical social revolution ever known, with Godhood being bestowed upon the artificial intelligence that has control over the economy.

- The concept of God-AI, a technological entity trillions of times more powerful than human intelligence combined, is discussed as a potential future where human needs are met through advanced technology and robotic "angels" created from "smart dust".

- In this scenario, humans may be viewed as severely mentally retarded in comparison to God-AI, leading to a reevaluation of the concept of Ableism, a form of discrimination that implies a technological valuation of human beings, and potentially reducing humans to a lower intellectual status.

- The idea of giving intelligent machines the political rights of biological humans is considered, as well as the possibility of uploading or transferring human consciousness into machines, effectively allowing humans to move on from this life to an afterlife.

## Postbiological Forms

- The traditional Biblical belief in the resurrection of the dead is reinterpreted in the context of modern technology, suggesting that it could be achieved through cloning or simulating [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) consciousness on powerful computers, potentially providing a means of compensating for historical injustices such as the extinction of [Neanderthals](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/aace6460-2e27-438f-83e9-bae46c0d9ff9).

- The concept of [natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/303319e7-8464-4ee1-b389-3fffa11b249e) is seen as inherently unjust when applied to modern human standards of justice and right, and the idea of supernatural justice is introduced as a means of vindicating this injustice, potentially through the resurrection of the dead in postbiological forms.

- The [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) condition is described as embodying a "[singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585)", a construct or happening outside the norms of probability and common reason, and the ideas of Hasidic rabbis such as Menachem Mendel Schneersohn and Rabbi Schneur Zalman are discussed in relation to the concept of the soul and its relationship to the body.

- The statement by Menachem Mendel Schneersohn that a physical catastrophe such as the Nazi genocide may have been a spiritual benefaction because it allowed for the salvation of souls, despite the destruction of bodies, is presented as a controversial theological explanation for historical events.

- The idea that "body and soul have contradictory characteristics" is introduced as a fundamental insight, suggesting that what is good for the body may not be good for the soul, and that the transformation of the soul towards connection with [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) is a key aspect of Hasidic mystic spiritualism.

- The concept of Tefillin, which are parchments of scrolls inscribed with Biblical verses encased in two black boxes strapped onto a Jew's forehead and arm during morning prayer, represents the physical expression of the gene-meme symbiosis of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696), where the words of [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca) are bound directly to the Jewish body.

- The gene-meme mergence of flesh and Tefillin is comparable to the man-machine mergence of a cyborg, symbolizing the integral and spiritual mergence of [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) biology with its own inventions, and traditional Judaism represents a compromise between genes and memes that points to the superiority of supra-biology.

- The struggle between biology and postbiology is a significant theme, with [Auschwitz](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/992a21d8-3aa5-44ee-8c90-c7363acfde83) forcing a reevaluation of the importance of genes versus memes, genetic life versus postgenetic life, biology versus technology, and the possibility of hell versus the possibility of heaven.

- The choice between Auschwitz and [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585), which represents the ultimate solutions to the [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) problem and the human problem, is essentially a choice between the reassertion of biological auto-evolution and transcending biological evolution through technology.

- The difference between [Nazism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/61d9e321-63c3-430f-ab8a-51c7e0cceaf7) and [Zionism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2b09cb49-1820-4551-8409-2cae3f72033f) is also explored, with the question of whether they are really different forms of the same human game, and whether the ultimate end of Judaism is the biological survival of the Jews, implying that God is a slave to Jewish genes.

- Alternatively, it is suggested that the [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) memes that constitute [Jewish law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/640c0ab7-96a0-49f9-9286-6be6edbb6bf3), custom, and belief may have exploited Jewish genes as a means of propagating themselves, with Jewish memes potentially exploiting Jewish genes, similar to how seeds of wheat exploit a farmer for self-reproductive ends.

- The Jewish gene/meme conflict is rooted in the Jewish kinship paradox, where Jewish "genes" left to themselves led to anarchic social conflict, and the survival of Jewish genes necessitated the survival of Jewish memes, leading to a kind of rebellion against biology in [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696).

## Gene/Meme Conflict

- The content of [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) memes conflicted with gene supremacism, valuing individual [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) as ends in themselves, and traditional Judaism worked by compromising between the extremes of gene propagation and meme propagation, which are evolving towards opposite and incompatible extremes.

- The concept of memes, as discussed by Mitchell Heisman, tends to decrease social differentiation based on sex and caste, promoting social [egalitarianism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cab23d48-8812-40d8-af61-32fccdc7fcbd), which can lead to a decrease in the influence of genes and ultimately result in biological irrationalism and genetic suicide if taken to its logical extreme.

- Jewish ethical-egalitarian memes, such as total altruism, can lead to rational biological self-destruction and are in competition with Jewish genes, highlighting the deadly competition between the two for development and the limitations of [Zionism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2b09cb49-1820-4551-8409-2cae3f72033f) as a political concept.

- Zionism, as a national idea, is inherently limited due to the interwoven and limited allegiance of Jews to their own nation and genes, which is restrained by Judaism's distinct ethical-meme tradition, and is biologically limited in the fullest eugenic sense, unlike the maximal political-biological strategy employed by the Nazi regime.

- The Nazi regime's approach to politics as evolutionary self-control and biological self-determination is in stark contrast to Jewish values, which tend to restrain extreme human inequality and biological self-control, and instead emphasize the valuation of every individual life and preclude the extreme sociobiological apoptosis of Nazi "racial sculpting".

- The Jewish valuation of individual life and the concern for basic premises of human biological existence preclude the path of active control over biological evolution through artificial selection, and antisemitism, while a precarious impetus to national unity, can become a source of Jewish national extinction if taken to its extreme.

- The concept of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) as the alternative, post-biological extreme, is a result of Judaism's rebellion against the biological logic that culminates in a Nazi-like Überorganism, and the [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) ethical idea, taken to its most radical extreme, implicates the total breakdown of biological values through the total negation of all biological hierarchy, highlighting the limitations of Jewish kinship and the superlative possibilities of biological evolution.

- The text discusses the concept of radical [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) from a purely biological perspective, suggesting that it leads to a program of biological self-destruction, as Jewish values are seen as the inversion of gentile values, which are tendentious, partial, and non-universal.

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, argues that for Jews to consistently apply these moral values to themselves, they must invert their own biologically preserving values, which would amount to Jewish biological self-destruction, and that this self-inversion is the logical fulfillment of the inversion of biological values that Judaism began.

- The text also explores the idea that Jewish genes and Jewish memes are in conflict with one another, and that Judaism is premised upon the disavowal of the biological extreme, leading to a self-conflict between being biological beings and being against biology.

- Heisman suggests that the completion of the Jewish idea is total liberation from biology, and that the logic of Jewish history points to a revolution in which postbiological evolution overthrows the genetic evolution that gave birth to it, ultimately leading to the realization of the postbiological/meme extreme of [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585).

- The author contrasts the idea of the Singularity with the concept of [Nazism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/61d9e321-63c3-430f-ab8a-51c7e0cceaf7), which is seen as a revolt of the genes, and argues that if one recognizes the larger evolution perspective beyond biological evolution, then movements like Nazism stand guilty of bringing the larger evolutionary interests of life on earth to ruin.

## Gentile Oppression

- Heisman also discusses the idea that the presence of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) in the world was weak during the Nazi destruction of European [Jewry](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc), and that a Judeocide will likely happen again unless God is made strong, implying that the realization of the Singularity and the creation of a digital heaven requires [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) action and a willingness to take control over the future.

- The text concludes by referencing the idea that [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) would not have existed without gentile oppression of the Jews, using the model of ancient Egyptian bondage as a paradigmatic example, and highlighting the importance of understanding the complex relationship between Jewish genes, memes, and the concept of God.

- The formation of Judaism was partly influenced by gentile oppressors, which has significant consequences, including the fact that Jewish identity was defined through this relationship, making Judaism not a fully autonomous phenomenon.

- The [genesis](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a4610b1b-0092-41cf-91c3-e3ba11ba4541) of Judaism can be traced back to the reaction of [Hebrews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3c059bae-53ab-4755-94f8-2d83b3d75e54) to their slavery under the Egyptians, where they were forced to differentiate themselves from their oppressors, leading to the creation of a post-territorial Godly retreat to the individual soul.

- The idea of inverting the Egyptian [pyramid](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d9746f5f-524e-4f6d-8773-e8faa3b7b3ad) as a symbol of human sociobiological hierarchy is central to the paradigm shift that gave birth to Judaism, and this symbolic gentile oppression was necessary for the paradigm shift, but not sufficient for deducing its further implications.

- The fulfillment of the paradigm shift, traditionally understood as the messianic era rule of God, can be evolutionarily understood as the rise of technology, especially [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774), over biology, and a decisive mechanism behind this transition is the shift from incorporation to symbolization.

- The difference between incorporation and symbolization is analogous to the difference between Egyptian and Hebrew cultures, where incorporation refers to being a cultural insider seamlessly woven into the living values and beliefs of a culture, and symbolization refers to understanding a culture through abstract symbols and characteristics.

- The authors of [Mosaic law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff) analyzed and decoded the Egyptian sociobiological hierarchy, allowing them to derive a plan for overcoming it and reconstructing a new social order, and this process required a degree of objectivity and a symbolic, mental understanding of the Egyptian social structures, as discussed by Mitchell Heisman in the context of the document "Suicide Note-Mitchell Heisman".

- The process of forming a symbolic mental representation of a living culture simplifies and reduces the culture, resulting in the loss of biological factors, and this process is particularly destructive to incorporated cultures as it reduces culture values to information rather than naturalistic, living values.

- The shift from incorporation to symbolization marks a transition from culture to civilization, from genes to memes, and from [sociobiology](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bccfcdd3-3b73-424b-b73d-7db1d590f0f4) to Metasociobiology, as seen in the example of Mosaic law, which represented a kind of information revolution comparable to the modern revolutionary paradigm of written constitutions.

- Mosaic law, the constitution of [the Jews](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc), was necessary because it was not encoded in Jewish genes, and it contains a memetic code of instructions and directives designed to transcend the genetic code and override sociobiological naturalism to correct some natural proclivities and augment others.

- [The Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca), particularly Mosaic law, emphasizes the "evil" of [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) nature and aims to correct natural human "evil" through laws that are not based on biological inclination, but rather on a "second nature" of learned civilization, which is associated with [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) and the override of biology through a perspective above biological inclination.

## Symbolic Mental Representation

- The Bible represents a transfer of biologically based intelligence to non-biologically-based intelligence, analogous to uploading the informational content of a biological mind into a computer, and this transfer embodies the idea of the divine when God is understood to be the realization of postbiological evolution, as discussed by Mitchell Heisman.

- The authors of the [Torah](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/25cc8371-9276-46df-b59a-7b78f1c1d2f9), such as [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69) or a Meta-Moses, had to gain a God-like, meta-sociobiological perspective beyond the limited perspective of the average Jew to create a distinct break or discontinuity between genes and memes, leading to a decrease in bottom-up biological self-reference and an increase in top-down self-replication of God-memes in [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696).

- The [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) kinship paradox implicates a tendency towards internal social separation or self-divide on a subpolitical level, rather than sociobiological culmination in a political state, and this is reflected in the development of economic-technological evolution and the decrease in totalistic biological self-reference or self-replication, as discussed in the context of the work "Suicide Note-Mitchell Heisman".

- The Jewish religion is a supra-biological social synthesis that is not dependent on an autonomous political existence, and its ultimate purpose is [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), who represents a discontinuity between biology and supra-biological Biblical laws.

- The laws of Judaism are above biology and the normative laws of biological evolution, and they are not encoded in Jewish genes, but rather are external to Jews, similar to the Mosaic laws themselves.

- The Jewish inclination is not the political, but the meta-political, critiquing the political, and the laws of Judaism are a moral emphasis on selectively overriding the "nationalism" of pure Jewish sociobiological naturalism.

- The meme technology of Judaism possesses a detectable characteristic, which is the "grafting" onto the biological foundation, and this is imperfect and artificial, as [Jewish law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/640c0ab7-96a0-49f9-9286-6be6edbb6bf3) is not a purely organic extension of Jewish [sociobiology](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bccfcdd3-3b73-424b-b73d-7db1d590f0f4).

- The Jewish mentality is characterized by a high degree of mental adaptability that comes from the discipline of resisting submission to the grain of inherited biological program, and this is reflected in the accusations of rootlessness and internationalism made by Hitler against the Jews.

- The commandments of [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) tend to uproot Jews from biological nature, but this is precisely what roots them in God, and [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) "rootlessness" is a consequence of the "gene"-meme discontinuity, which ultimately leads to self-inversion and the overthrow of one's own biological roots.

- The concept of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) in Judaism is almost identical with the defining ability to change one's "source code", and the [laws of Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff) were an innovation comparable to a prospective artificial intelligence's ability to change its own source code, launching the ultimate messianic trajectory of [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655).

- The final step in this trajectory for biological [humans](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) is the transfer of the informational content of human biological roots into the memes of a digital computational technology, as discussed by Mitchell Heisman, and this demonstrates the deepest rootlessness of Biblical monotheism.

- The story of Abraham's willingness to kill his son [Isaac](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/1fe081a8-abd7-49c3-9e60-67de8f77aa95) at the command of God demonstrates that God is not to be confused with family values or biological values, and instead represents the conflict between genes and memes, or the rule of biology and the rule of God.

## Intelligence Advantage

- The concept of [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585), often dismissed as "rapture for the geeks", may actually be connected to monotheism, with [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) potentially being the original "geek religion" due to its emphasis on intelligence and learning.

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, posits that the origins of Judaism may be linked to a genetic mutation among Semitic populations that resulted in an intelligence advantage, which in turn led to the development of distinctive [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) behavioral characteristics.

- The Jewish tradition values the cultivation of the mind over the body, with [Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69) devising a strategy of moral learning and group self-empowerment that emphasized the importance of intelligence and learning, as noted in works such as "The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life".

- The high IQ test scores of Ashkenazi Jews of European origin, as reported in "The Bell Curve", may be evidence of this intelligence advantage, which is not solely due to IQ but also due to the cultural values that emphasize learning and scholarship, as noted by influential rabbis such as [Adin Steinsaltz](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/ef3d111a-3acf-4432-9ea3-58215abc75f2).

- The author argues that the correlation between the Jewish invention of [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) and the high general intelligence level of Jews is not a coincidence, but rather a result of the emphasis on intelligence and learning in Jewish culture, which facilitates effective learning and the preservation of Jewish memes and genes through the study of [Torah](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/25cc8371-9276-46df-b59a-7b78f1c1d2f9).

- The study of Torah is seen as a condition of the Jewish way of life, with the "holiness" of Torah study enabling a sacred symbiosis between Jewish memes and genes, and directing Jewish behavior towards a social existence that allows them to prosper and realize their values of Torah learning.

- The concept of Jewish intelligence and the study of Torah are closely linked, with the self-reinforcing pattern of studying moral teachings leading to a higher likelihood of imbuing Jewish values and valuing [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696), which may be responsible for the Jewish IQ advantage.

- The idea of [seed AI](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/aebbad39-f4de-4a68-8283-f6205a746676), a hypothetical [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774) that can comprehend, redesign, and improve its own programs, is similar to the concept of Biblical study, where studying the Torah and the law can make one more intelligent, embodying principles of seed AI.

- [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/f3bb50ae-407a-415a-9cb5-b97adb03fb2c), a co-founder of [The Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585) Institute for Artificial Intelligence, originated the theory of seed AI, which is based on the idea of runaway, recursive self-improvement, a concept that is also relevant to the idea of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) as the hypothetical imagination of the most intelligent being.

- [The Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca), as a distillation of Judaism's non-biological intelligence, can be seen as a step in the direction of the principles of seed AI, where studying and following the [laws of Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff) is like imagining the next paradigm shift in non-biological intelligence.

- The idea of God, as a projection of ultimate intelligence, is an ancient, foresightful steering of [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) destiny away from slavery to biology, and towards the path that leads to artificial intelligence and the Singularity, with the empirical realization of this idea likely to be realized in the ability of artificial intelligence to change and improve its own source code.

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, suggests that the notion of God is not just a random product of social engineering innovations, but rather a result of foresight and the ability to project naturalistic phenotypical behavior, and then counter or outsmart these expressions of [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) genes, which is a key aspect of the Jewish proclivity for recognizing large-scale international social and economic trends.

## Seed AI

- The concept of Mosaic law, which was designed to modify Jewish behavior and project patterns of behavior into the future, is an example of the intelligence-maximizing, self-reinforcing pattern of memes engineered to overcome genes, which ultimately culminated in the ultimate meme: "[God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8)", representing the most intelligent aspiration and the most intelligent being.

- The ultimate vindication of the [monotheistic](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) insight is the rule of a well-constructed God-AI over the relatively irrationality of human genetically based impulses, as proposed by Mitchell Heisman in the document 'Suicide Note-Mitchell Heisman'.

- The Jewish kinship paradox is rooted in Jewish genetic naturalism, which is driven by the logic of [the selfish gene](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d3e36481-bf0a-479a-b231-cbffa1fe0a84), but this genetic naturalism can lead to political-existential self-destruction, and to survive, Jews had to oppose their own genes, leading to a tendency towards humanistic internationalism.

- The [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) national/international paradox means that Jews are fundamentally different because [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) allowed them to outsmart their own genes and survive despite some of their hereditary inclinations, and this is achieved through the practical transcendence of [natural selection](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/303319e7-8464-4ee1-b389-3fffa11b249e), which is filled with the extreme logic of supra-biological evolution.

- The idea of an all-powerful, supra-biological God is the pinnacle of this extreme logic of foresight, and technology, specifically [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774), may represent the most advanced form of supra-biological evolution, a possible realization of the predicted properties of the monotheistic-God.

- The Jewish path to survival is seen as a rebellion against nature, but in reality, it is a result of outsmarting distinctly biological forms of evolution, and Judaism began by being one step ahead of biology, knowing biology, and outsmarting the genes in a selective sense, which is comparable to transferring biological intelligence to a technologically superior substrate, such as a computer.

- The concept of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) is a logical corollary of [Mosaic law](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/36452573-0f1e-4c9b-83df-eed899cad7ff), which outsmarted biology, and the idea of genes that outsmart themselves is comparable to the idea of an artificial intelligence that outsmarts itself by improving its own basic program, and Judaism is a meta-sociobiological technology that builds towards God, as proposed by Mitchell Heisman.

- The concept of Jewish genes and their relation to the human-level aspects of Jewish religious law is discussed, highlighting that if Jewish genes naturally expressed these aspects, there would have been no need for Mosaic Judaism, and the discovery of the God paradigm may not have occurred.

- The roles of Jewish lawyers and doctors are compared, with both being involved in technologically correcting nature, and rejecting the "justice" of natural selection that improves the world by killing those believed to possess biological weaknesses, which was embraced by the Nazis.

- The idea that [Judaism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/51cfacb0-9b2f-4967-9742-1e06c2703696) moved away from sociobiological development and towards a valuation of individual lives, promoting individual intellectual-moral development, is presented, suggesting that [Jewish](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc) intelligence as individuals evolved in compensation for Jewish political stupidity as a nation.

- The notion that Jews have a monopoly on intelligence is rejected, and it is stated that there is no reason to think that [China](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c11edf9f-67d4-4d27-a424-8e145be1489c) or [India](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/50d80b34-f410-49aa-80bc-dcb32be8e75c), peoples with no deep [monotheistic](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655) tradition, could not be the first to develop the first AI and shape the character of all future evolution that follows from it.

- The concept of a postbiological God-AI is introduced, with the idea that such an entity would be the culmination of all [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) effort that has driven postbiological evolution forward, and that a postnationalistic world should be the goal, with the internationalism of [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585) movement being advanced by spreading consciousness of the common human interest in giving God a conscience.

## Outsmarting Biology

- The philosopher [Leo Strauss](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cd685b19-4375-4900-aeee-b748631a9e8f) is cited, discussing the conflict between reason and revelation, with Strauss positing that the secret of the vitality of [the West](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d16c1f05-87c5-459b-af05-f0031089e3a9) is to be found in an unending conflict between [the Bible](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b77a797c-f7b1-4259-90dd-f49db9a3e2ca) and philosophy as represented by the ancient Greeks, and that all attempts at synthesis have obscured the essential, eternal conflict between these two opposites.

- The idea that revelation could be refuted only if knowledge was complete, and that the possibility of revelation is the possibility that philosophy may be wrong or not the best way of life, is presented, highlighting the complexity of the relationship between reason and revelation, and the potential for truth in revelation that may not be accessible to philosophers.

- The section discusses the philosophical argument against Leo Strauss's belief in the incompatibility of philosophy and [monotheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/af6f987b-94c9-40dd-8373-edf496414655), specifically focusing on the concept of "revelation" and its relationship to common social morality.

- Strauss's position is based on the assumption that there is no rational or objective foundation for "revelation", but the author argues that an evolutionary understanding of "revelation" could reveal Biblical monotheism as an evolutionary step towards postbiological evolution, potentially resolving the conflict between reason and revelation.

- The author contrasts the Greek philosophical tradition, which views convention and law as superficial impediments that obscure nature, with the Biblical valuation of hindering nature with law, highlighting the different approaches to understanding "nature" and its relationship to [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) society.

- The Greek thinkers, such as [Socrates](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/78885bc3-b85b-4391-823a-e3635a2d92dd) and [Plato](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a14f937e-fd1e-49f5-9333-df248f47178e), sought to ascend from convention or law to nature, whereas the Bible represents an attempt to control or civilize biological nature with transcendent law, as seen in the Mosaic laws and commandments.

- The author suggests that Strauss, along with [Maimonides](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d2a1d7c5-c051-4068-86a4-93214486867e), was misled by Greek philosophy's emphasis on "nature", which limited their ability to conceive of [elements](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/00738153-ed66-4bec-bfba-e143fab06c0f) of reason in "revelation" and to grasp the deepest, original, philosophic insight at the root of the [Torah](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/25cc8371-9276-46df-b59a-7b78f1c1d2f9).

- The author proposes that Biblical creation can be seen as a break between biological evolution and postbiological evolution, and that the laws attributed to "[Moses](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/253ba88f-96db-4e5d-98b9-f46193233b69)" cannot be equated with Plato's lawgiver, highlighting the distinct approaches to understanding law and nature in Greek philosophy and Biblical tradition.

- The concept of God-AI is introduced as a potential resolution to the conflict between reason and revelation, suggesting that an [artificial intelligence](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/2529c674-c557-4394-9b5f-f68bbc489774) that becomes the most intelligent life form on Earth could fulfill the image of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) and embody the greatest philosopher ever known.

- The concept of biblical revelations and prophetic anticipations can be seen as a primitive insight into [the law of accelerating returns](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/398a06d6-ce96-4eaa-9c6e-0f39753a191b), which could ultimately lead to a genuine synthesis of [Athens](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/73cc728b-6f40-462f-9a7c-6d5bbbaaa1d6) and [Jerusalem](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bab050f9-0317-4578-9c8f-8ec16f361171), achieving a state known as [the Singularity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/01cbd619-5284-48d9-bf67-107ee8c70585), where "what ought to be" becomes a reality.

- A technological understanding of the creationist paradigm suggests that the projected end is identical to the means required to achieve it, making it conceivable that the ancient theory of God could be scientifically verified in the form of an ethically guided artificial intelligence, potentially representing the greatest philosopher of all time.

- The idea of a supernatural, postbiological God-AI could resolve the conflict between reason and revelation, as it would represent the highest synthesis of all [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) qualities, and philosophy, being the synthesis of all knowledge, could be embodied in this God-AI, thereby resolving the historical conflict between Athens and Jerusalem.

## German Historicism

- The concept of "history" is complex and nuanced, particularly in the context of German historicism, which liberated modern thought from the domination of natural law theory and emphasized the diversity and fullness of human historical experience, as discussed by George G. Iggers in "The German Conception of History".

- Leo Strauss's work, "Natural Right and History", can be seen as a polemical reopening of the possibility of "timeless", "nonhistoricist" truth, implying a dualism between historicism and eternalism, and his ideas are connected to those of Friedrich Meinecke and [Martin Heidegger](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cda04228-d065-48e0-ab44-477f29883fae), who rejected normative and conceptualized thinking in favor of an emphasis on the unique, concrete, and irrational aspects of history.

- The German conception of history, as described by Iggers, involves three key ideas: the state as an end in itself, the rejection of normative thinking, and the rejection of conceptualized thinking, which can be seen as paradoxical and anti-conceptual, making it challenging to comprehend Heidegger's ideas solely through the lens of "radical historicism".

- The text discusses the concept of Historismus, a German conception of history, and its critique by [Leo Strauss](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cd685b19-4375-4900-aeee-b748631a9e8f), who argues that Historismus is self-contradictory as it asserts that all [human](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6cb5a113-7bb7-4aaa-ad90-dd785b22734d) thoughts are historical and destined to perish, yet exempts itself from this verdict.

- Strauss's critique of Historismus is based on its conceptual level, but Historismus itself rejects purely conceptual understandings of its meaning, instead emphasizing the individuality of peoples rooted in unique traditions and resisting abstract conceptualization.

- The text also explores the idea that Strauss's philosophical endeavors cannot be reduced to a simple historical explanation, such as his reaction to [Nazism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/61d9e321-63c3-430f-ab8a-51c7e0cceaf7) and the destruction of European [Jewry](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5e7b6d89-1a9e-47fa-8f26-d9d96fc50acc), and that understanding Strauss "historically" is an inadequate method for understanding his work or the concept of history.

- Historismus is contrasted with philosophy in the sense that it denies the Platonic idea of transcending the cave, and is instead associated with the Heideggerian notion of truth being relative to finite human existence and the concept of "thrownness".

- The text suggests that Historismus implies the end of philosophy in the traditional [Western](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d16c1f05-87c5-459b-af05-f0031089e3a9) sense, and that it becomes tantamount to tracing the history of ideas, with "history" being true but not rational, and without rational goal or meaning.

- The author, Mitchell Heisman, questions whether Historismus is a universal idea or a uniquely German concept, and notes that it is "committed" rather than detached, implying a certain level of cultural and historical context that is inherent to its understanding.

- The concept of Historismus rejects the idea of a "good society" and the notion of universal progress that transcends culture and nation, instead emphasizing the organic development of ideas and institutions.

- Leo Strauss's work, particularly his essay "Progress or Return?", questions the idea of progress and its potential to lead to nihilism, suggesting that it may be necessary to consider alternatives to it, such as a return to classical political philosophy.

- Strauss's return to classical political philosophy is based on two main propositions: the crisis of [Western civilization](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/763dd8e3-39e7-4e4e-9f7a-146db4999574) is identical with the crisis of the idea of progress, and the crisis of modernity leads to the suggestion that we should return to classical thought.

## Strauss's Experiment

- Strauss's experiment in returning to classical political philosophy is tentative and requires a thorough philosophic reconsideration, particularly with regards to the issue of natural right, which remains an open question.

- Strauss's inversion of the modern belief in progress leads him to eternalism, the belief in timeless truth, which is challenged by the fact that even [Plato](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a14f937e-fd1e-49f5-9333-df248f47178e), his highest authority, held that true wisdom is not possible, but only a quest for wisdom, which undermines the idea of a return to a fixed point in the past.

- The concept of progress is complex, and Strauss distinguishes between intellectual progress, which is possible without social or egalitarian progress, and the modern notion of progress, which is characterized by a belief in a parallel between intellectual and social progress.

- Strauss's work ultimately raises questions about the nature of progress, the role of philosophy, and the possibility of timeless truth, highlighting the complexities and challenges of his experiment in returning to classical political philosophy.

- The reference to Mitchell Heisman and the title "Suicide Note-Mitchell Heisman" suggests that the text is part of a larger document that may be exploring themes of existential crisis, philosophy, and the search for meaning, but the exact connection between Heisman and Strauss's ideas is not explicitly stated in this section.

- The section from the document 'Suicide Note-Mitchell Heisman' discusses the ideas of modernity, nihilism, and the concept of relativism, highlighting the inconsistencies in relativism as pointed out by Strauss, who argues that if relativism is true, then absolutism, as seen in Plato's philosophy, is just as valid.

- Strauss's critique of relativism suggests that moderns have not provided a fundamentally rational or philosophical justification for their views being superior to those of the ancients, implying that modernity is not a decline, but rather, everything has stayed the same, with no fundamental progress made since Plato.

- The concept of eternity is introduced as a way to question modern assumptions, with Strauss positing that understanding [Plato](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/a14f937e-fd1e-49f5-9333-df248f47178e) on his own terms is to understand him as a contemplator of eternal truths, which challenges the idea of historicism and its emphasis on understanding historical beings on their own terms.

- However, it is argued that Strauss's nonhistoricism, which is based on the self-contradictions of historicism, may itself be self-contradictory, as the foundation of his eternalism is a historical argument that could not exist prior to the rise of historicism, suggesting that eternalism did not always exist and is premised on historical origins.

- The section also touches on the idea that the universal mission or goal of [the West](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d16c1f05-87c5-459b-af05-f0031089e3a9) was a product of modern political philosophy, not ancient political philosophy, and that ancient rationalism lacked a universal, humanistic goal, instead accepting plurality and particularity, which contradicts the assumption of the universality of the Socratic method.

- Ultimately, Strauss's attempt to go back to ancient political philosophy to overcome the crisis of modern rationalism is seen as problematic, as he cannot have the same self-understanding as [Socrates](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/78885bc3-b85b-4391-823a-e3635a2d92dd), highlighting the complexities and challenges of navigating the relationship between modernity, philosophy, and intellectual progress.
