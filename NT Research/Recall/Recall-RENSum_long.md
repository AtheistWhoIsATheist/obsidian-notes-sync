# The Religious Experience of Nihilism

- The section from 'The Religious Experience of Nihilism' begins with quotes from [[William James]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], highlighting the inherent sadness and [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]] that can result from a purely naturalistic or positivistic worldview, which can lead to a sense of despair despite a healthy-minded approach to life.
- The author acknowledges that their interpretation of nihilism may be at odds with mainstream philosophical definitions and will be drawing heavily from the works of other thinkers, including Nietzsche, Heidegger, and [[Blaise Pascal | Pascal]], who all describe the human experience of nihilism in their own unique ways.
- The author reflects on their own experience and approach to writing, noting that they are torn between confidence and humility, and that doubt is a constant presence in their work, which may seem disjointed or contradictory at times, but asserts that the experience from which it stems is real and authentic.
- The text emphasizes that the ideas expressed are not born from the personal experiences or worldly existence of the thinkers quoted, but rather from a universal experience that transcends individual backgrounds and perspectives, and that there are no heroes or authorities in the context of nihilism, but rather a shared experience articulated by various thinkers.

---

# Nihilism and Humility

- The author agrees with Freud's sentiment that most people are flawed and that this is something that cannot be said aloud, emphasizing the importance of humility in the face of the nihilistic experience, and notes that the purpose of quoting various thinkers is to show that they all describe the same universal experience of [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]], despite their unique language and perspectives.
- The text concludes by emphasizing the idea that the experience of nihilism is available to any human consciousness that is willing to participate, and that it is not limited to any particular individual or group, highlighting the complexities and challenges of human relationships and the importance of acknowledging the universality of nihilism.
- The author denies any claims of responsibility for the ideas presented, stating that no individual, including themselves, should be elevated to a pedestal, and that there is no finite authority emerging from the visions expressed, instead emphasizing the shared experience of nihilism that is described by thinkers such as [[Blaise Pascal | Pascal]], [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], Cioran, [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], Nietzsche, Buber, Heidegger, and Tillich.
- The quotes from various thinkers are not meant to convey new information, but rather to illustrate the shared experience of nihilism, and the author notes that their own words are not distinct from those of the thinkers quoted, highlighting the idea that the experience of nihilism is a universal and shared human experience.

---

# Independent Thinking and Shared Experience
- The text discusses the importance of independent thinking and shared experience, quoting Cioran's statement that "existence is plagiarism," suggesting that all thoughts and ideas are interconnected, and highlighting the tension between individual thought and the shared experience of [[DarkNote/Nihilism]].
- The author emphasizes the importance of independent research and self-discovery in understanding religion and philosophy, citing Vivekananda's encouragement to find one's own light rather than following the teachings of others, and questioning the concept of 'scholarly' writing as potentially restrictive.

---

# The Human Condition and the Search for Meaning

- The text explores the human condition and the search for meaning, citing questions such as "What am I?" and "What is the purpose of existence?" as fundamental and elementary sentiments, and using quotes from Cioran, [[Blaise Pascal | Pascal]], and Becker to illustrate the human condition and the ways in which people cope with uncertainty and desperation.
- The concept of Nihilism is presented as a paradoxical and nonrational philosophy that exists within contradiction, and is suggested to be the only universal claim, as it acknowledges the subjective nature of truth and the uncertainty of existence, and cannot be reduced to a single definition or authority.

---

# Nihilism, Logic, and Existence

- The text references Heidegger's philosophy, suggesting that the dominance of "logic" within philosophy dissolves when confronted with the question of nothingness and being, and notes that existence is pervaded by nihilating behavior, which is often suppressed, but can be felt in the form of dread that is always present.
- Kierkegaard's concept of despair is discussed, highlighting the difference between true despair, which is the loss of the eternal, and earthly despair, and the author acknowledges that criticisms of their interpretation of [[DarkNote/Nihilism]] will likely be misdirected, as the experience of Nihilism is rare and critiques are often based on misunderstandings.
- The author claims to report their experiences without censorship, condemning all human thought and activity, and acknowledges that they may contradict themselves intentionally or unintentionally, emphasizing the importance of understanding Nihilism as a personal experience rather than a philosophical concept.

---

# Solace in Unconventional Thought

- The author finds solace in the company of notable thinkers like [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]] and Theresa of Avila, who also expressed unconventional ideas, and rejects the pursuit of approval or justification, instead embracing their role as a messenger rather than an author, and invites readers to disengage if they disagree.

---

# Exploring the Depths of Nihilism

- The text explores the concept of [[DarkNote/Nihilism]], which is often superficially addressed or dismissed by most people, and the author seeks to delve deeper into its mysteries by questioning the human experience of existence and the tendency to distract oneself from the reality of life.
- The author critiques the lack of genuine philosophers in the world, suggesting that most people are unthinking robots who regurgitate preconceived notions rather than questioning the nature of existence, and draws on quotes from thinkers like Theresa of Avila, Tolstoy, and Tillich to illustrate the complexity and profundity of the questions they are attempting to address.
- The concept of Nihilism is explored through various philosophical perspectives, including those of Heidegger, [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], Heisman, and Cicero, highlighting the abyssal experience of nihilism and its implications on human existence, and emphasizing the importance of questioning the existence of important questions.
- The author defends the seriousness of their exploration of Nihilism, suggesting that it is a necessary and meaningful pursuit, even if it challenges conventional logic and comfort, and notes that the work is presented as a 'story' rather than an argument, which will never be complete, as Nihilism is a concept that resists resolution or solution.

---

# The Voice of Despair and Hope

- The text also references the ideas of prominent thinkers, including Chesterton, who attempted to create his own original heresy, only to discover that it was actually a reiteration of existing traditions, and Luther, who criticizes someone for applying elegant sentiments in a childish and perverted manner, failing to consider the divine or the transcendent in their discussions.
- The section concludes with a reference to a voice that guides humanity forward, even in times of despair and hopelessness, suggesting that there is a deeper, more profound reality that can provide meaning and purpose in life, and the author emphasizes the role of wonder in sparking inquiry and the importance of acknowledging the nothingness at the heart of existence.

---

# Confronting Uncomfortable Truths

- The author explores the idea that people often ignore or downplay the negative aspects of life and focus on the positive, but argues that this approach ultimately fails, as it is impossible to hide the truth and the problems will eventually resurface, as discussed by [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]].
- Heidegger's notion that the world's darkness, the destruction of the earth, and the reduction of human beings to a mass have made categories like pessimism and optimism obsolete is emphasized, underscoring the gravity of the situation and the need to question the existence of important questions, as noted by Heisman and Cicero.
- The text ultimately presents a complex and profound exploration of [[DarkNote/Nihilism]], highlighting the importance of confronting uncomfortable truths and exploring the depths of human existence, even if it means embracing madness or the possibility of suicide, and suggesting that there is a deeper, more profound reality that can provide meaning and purpose in life.

---

# A Philosophy of Nothingness

- The concept of a philosophy of religion based on the nothingness of the world is explored, with the idea that great conversions often arise from the sudden revelation of life's meaninglessness, as noted by Cioran, highlighting the human tendency to philosophize and search for meaning.
- The analytical tradition is criticized for dismissing the claims of nihilism and reducing ultimate questions to a clash of incomplete arguments, while also highlighting the limitations of human thought and the tendency to react to stimuli rather than think independently.
- According to Nietzsche, the scholar has lost the instinct of self-defense and is no longer capable of original thought, instead relying on criticizing or affirming existing ideas and referencing other thinkers, which is seen as a limitation of the academic approach to philosophy.
- The atheist philosopher's rejection of a 'god' is seen as intellectually superior, but they fail to provide a non-pragmatic ground for trusting human reason within a naturalistic worldview, and instead rely on reason without justification in an ultimately purposeless universe, as illustrated by the 'problem of evil'.

---

# True Religion and Hubris

- True religion is not just about intellectual assent and empty talk, as noted by [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], but rather requires a deeper understanding and commitment, while 'religious' philosophers are criticized for their hubris-filled 'theodicies' that attempt to defend their conception of God by diminishing the Other.
- Heidegger is quoted as saying that philosophy cannot directly bring about historical change, but rather is the concern of a few individuals who transform creatively and unsettle things, and that true greatness does not consist in diminishing everything, but rather in embracing the complexity and richness of life.
- Nietzsche's approach to philosophy is described as attacking triumphant ideas and standing alone against them, even if it means compromising himself, while Shestov notes that understanding has revealed that there is nowhere to flee from Nothingness, highlighting the existential crisis at the heart of human experience.

---

# The Crisis of Philosophy

- The text concludes that philosophy is hanging itself due to its false interpretation of the Socratic Method, which has been deformed by positivistic and scientistic thinking, and that philosophers have exaggerated the importance of reason to the point of absurdity, ultimately leading to a crisis of meaning and purpose.
- The Socratic Method is questioned as to whether it is a tool for knowledge or a means to explore the mystery of human existence, and its pursuit is believed to lead to skepticism and doubt, highlighting the limitations of reason in understanding human existence.
- The analytic tradition of philosophy is criticized for being too distant from human existential conditions, eliminating direct experiences of human consciousness, and giving philosophers a false sense of accomplishment, as noted by philosophers such as Unamuno and Cioran.
- The concept of [[DarkNote/Nihilism]] is discussed, with "intellectual" notions of it being deemed stillborn, as no one truly understands the meaning of existence or the "Why?" behind it, and philosophers like Schopenhauer and Huxley provide insights into the human condition and the role of philosophy in understanding it.
- The tragic problem of philosophy is highlighted, which involves reconciling intellectual necessities with the necessities of the heart and will, and questioning whether all men face this contradiction squarely, as emphasized by Unamuno's quote.
- The importance of an organic and existential approach to philosophy is emphasized, as noted by Cioran, who believes that true seriousness and understanding can only be achieved by thinkers who are driven by a vital imbalance and are beyond science and art.
- Philosophy is concerned with the logical consequences of a proposition, regardless of its ontology or starting point, and to contribute to the project of understanding Nihilism, philosophy must derive an analysis or "map of consequences" grounded in direct human experience, as noted by [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]].


# The Experience and Message of Nihilism

- The experience of [[DarkNote/Nihilism]] is taken as a reality, characterized by boredom, anxiety, depression, ecstasy, despair, and other forms, and the goal is to discover whether there is a "message" or "constructive content" within it, as suggested by Cioran and Heisman.
- In exploring Nihilism, one may choose a reductionist, materialist explanation or a Transcendental approach, with the former found in science and psychology, and the latter in religion or theology, and the philosopher Heidegger's analysis of the human condition will be paramount in exploring Nihilism as a universal human experience.
- Heidegger's ontological analysis of conscience is prior to any description or classification of experiences of conscience and lies outside of biological or theological explanations, emphasizing the need to avoid exaggerating or making perverse claims about its outcome, and allowing for a nuanced understanding of Nihilism's constructive content and message.

---

# Transcendence and the Wholly-Other

- The concept of "transcendence" is introduced as a more neutral term to replace the vague and often self-concerned notion of "religious experience", referring to a feature of human experience that is not entirely deconstructive or naturalistic and is suggestive of the Wholly-Other.
- According to philosophers such as Heidegger, the nihilistic experience is a universal and perennial experience that holds a transcendent interpretation, and is considered the ground of all transcendent interpretations of human experience, emphasizing the importance of transforming human being into its openness to allow for a genuine experience of the nothing.
- The finite is indefinitely separated from the Infinite, and any attempts to move past the nihilistic experience or find completion within the world are seen as distractions from the reality of [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]], with philosophers such as Cioran and Tillich noting the importance of demythologizing sacred stories and recognizing the subjectivity of any "meaning" built upon a material, transitory structure.
- The realization of the ultimate reality and the experience of Nothingness can lead to a transcendence of worldly concerns and the understanding that all things, including philosophies and doctrines, are finite and fleeting, as expressed by [[Swami Vivekananda]], highlighting the importance of recognizing the truly ultimate and avoiding idolatrous faith that elevates finite realities to the rank of ultimacy.

---

# Distractions and Authenticity

- The "It world" described by Buber, where people live comfortably and are distracted by various stimulations, can prevent individuals from confronting the reality of death and the meaninglessness of existence, while Heidegger's concept of the "they" refers to the way in which societal norms and expectations can regulate an individual's behavior and prevent them from confronting their own mortality, instead encouraging a tranquilized and inauthentic existence.
- Ultimately, the text concludes by emphasizing the importance of skepticism and recognizing the subjectivity of any "meaning" built upon a material, transitory structure, which will inevitably collapse as illusory, and the need to confront the reality of nihilism and the experience of Nothingness in order to achieve a genuine and authentic existence.

---

# The Primacy of Experience

- The primacy of experience in transcendent thinking is essential, as emphasized by philosophers such as [[Swami Vivekananda]], Nietzsche, and Tolstoy, who stress the need to experience [[DarkNote/Nihilism]] in order to re-evaluate values and ideals and recognize the meaninglessness and impermanence of existence.
- The experience of Nothingness can be a transformative and profound experience, as expressed by St. Augustine, and is characterized by a sense of dread, anguish, and ontological despair, as described by Tønnessen, who highlights the idea that this experience is not just a philosophical concept, but a deeply personal and existential crisis.

---

# The Ontological Basis of Nothingness

- The ontological basis of Nothingness is necessary to understand the experience of Nihilism, which is rooted in the concept of Nihilism and is characterized by a hidden meaninglessness throughout all of the world's activities, and can be expressed through the idea of "no-thing" as described by Heidegger, where dread reveals the absence of meaning and significance in the world.
- Heidegger's concept of "no-thing" and the absence of meaning is further explored through the idea that anxiety arises from the fact that environmental entities no longer have any involvement, and the world has sunk into insignificance, leaving only an empty and merciless presence, as also described by [[William James]], who notes that this experience can be expressed as a state of negativity and deadness.
- The experience of [[DarkNote/Nihilism]] is a universal aspect of the human condition, but its extreme forms are rare, and the experience is typically received in piecemeal, making it difficult to fully comprehend, and is marked by a sense of the uncanny, where "something is uncanny," but the nature of this "something" cannot be defined, and is characterized by a sense of indifference, where all things and the self sink into nothingness.
- The concept of Nihilism is also linked to the idea of a "moving away of be-ing as a whole" that closes in on the individual, creating a sense of pressure and leaving nothing to hold onto, as described by Tønnessen, and is emphasized by philosophers such as Nietzsche, who stresses the need to experience Nihilism in order to re-evaluate values and ideals, and Tolstoy, who highlights the absurdity and meaninglessness of an isolated personal life.

---

# The Rarity and Avoidance of Nihilism

- The experience of dread and the concept of no-thing, as noted by Heidegger, is a rare phenomenon where individuals encounter the abyss of meaninglessness at the heart of existence, and this experience is often overlooked or forgotten in everyday life.
- The rarity of nihilism is questioned by Cioran, who suggests that a metaphysics of death may be possible only by accepting death's transcendental nature, and this perspective is characterized by a sense of horror and dread that is not continually present but rather a rare and intense experience.
- The concept of [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]] is often downplayed or avoided, with individuals consumed by their own personalities and the busyness of the world, and even those who experience nihilism deeply may feel a sense of suspicion that it is still not fully understood.
- Heidegger notes that when anxiety subsides, people often downplay the significance of their experiences, saying "it was really nothing," which can be seen as a way of avoiding the reality of nihilism, and Cioran suggests that saints, rather than philosophers, may hold the key to understanding nihilism.

---

# The Absurd Perspective

- The absurd perspective, as described by Nietzsche, refers to the moment when an individual's values and virtues become repulsive to them, and they question the meaning of their happiness, reason, and morality, leading to a sense of absurdity and the feeling that all possibilities are equivalent and meaningless.
- The concept of the multiverse, or "world-assemble," suggests that there are an infinite number of universes and versions of an individual, leading to the idea that every possible decision will be made by one of these versions, rendering subjective morality and meaning empty, and the concept of free will and determinism becomes irrelevant in this context.
- The "B" theory of time, which suggests that there is no temporal becoming and no privileged "now," further reinforces the idea that all moments in time, including birth and death, are equally real, and existence is equivalent to a static movie reel, despite the potential for this perspective to lead to [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]], many humans continue to force subjective meaning onto their lives, denying the objective reality of the multiverse and the impermanence of human existence.
- The human mind has a limited capacity to comprehend the vast expanse of time and the universe, leading to a "small world" understanding that shields individuals from the horrors of self-conscious existence and the impermanence of human civilization, as highlighted by the quotes from [[Thomas Ligotti]], Will Durant, and [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]].

---

# Nihilism and the Meaning of Life

- The concept of nihilism is explored, where life is seen as having no inherent meaning, and the idea of finding meaning in a seemingly meaningless world is questioned, with Friedrich Nietzsche's quote emphasizing the absurdity of taking pride in one's descent, laboring together, or serving the common welfare when life ultimately has no meaning.
- The text argues that embracing nihilism may be a hubristic act, as it disregards the struggles and accomplishments of human existence, and that all actions and achievements will eventually be erased, while also referencing Leo Tolstoy's observation that death and the transitoriness of all things destroy the meaning of life.
- The absurdity of finding meaning in a meaningless world is illustrated through the example of two people trapped in a tennis court with no ball, and one person insisting on playing, raising questions about the nature of meaning and whether it can be invented or subjective, and how long such meaning would be sustainable.
- The concept of "genuine boredom" by [[Martin Heidegger]] is referenced, which occurs when one's whole world is boring, revealing the underlying meaninglessness of existence, and [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]] is seen as taking away the "ball" from the game of life, leaving individuals to invent new games that eventually succumb to absurdity and boredom.

---

# Confronting Nothingness

- The human inability to sit alone in a room, as observed by [[Blaise Pascal | Pascal]], reveals a deep-seated discomfort with stillness and quiet contemplation, which in turn exposes feelings of nothingness, forlornness, and weakness, and this inherent restlessness suggests that humans are driven by a Transcendental yearning or a search for something more.
- According to [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]] and Tolstoy, people tend to avoid confronting the reality of their mortality and the impermanence of things, instead opting for optimism or distractions that provide a false sense of security, and Tolstoy's realization of Nihilism is characterized by the awareness that everything is ultimately meaningless and will be forgotten, leading to a sense of absurdity and cruelty in the face of mortality.
- The experience of Nihilism can lead to a sense of desperation, leaving individuals with limited options: madness, suicide, or the pursuit of something beyond the void, referred to as the "Other", and the nature of the "Other" is unclear, and it is uncertain whether it is distinct from madness or suicide, or if it can lead to either of these outcomes.

---

## Christian Nihilism and the Abyss
- The concept of Christian [[DarkNote/Nihilism]], as noted by [[Seraphim Rose]], is distinct from the Nihilism that proceeds from the Abyss, where the world is all and God is nothing, highlighting the paradox at the heart of the human experience.
- The philosopher Cioran describes the experience of being severed from life and confronting the nothingness of the world, leading to a questioning of whether there is anything beyond this void, and this idea is explored through various philosophical perspectives, including those of Shestov, Spong, Sartre, and Vivekananda.
- These philosophers grapple with the idea of a godless world and the search for ultimate reality, with Spong suggesting that one must either find a new way to speak of and engage with God or accept living in a godless world, while Sartre claims that even if God existed, it would change nothing, and [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]] argues that practical life is a hypocritical and fraudulent existence.

---

## Throwness and Inauthenticity
- Heidegger's concept of "throwness" is discussed, where Dasein, or human existence, is always falling back into the world and is sucked into the turbulence of inauthenticity, and he also notes that in everydayness, Dasein can undergo dull suffering and evade it by seeking new distractions, but can never extinguish it.
- The idea of a divided-self or double-mindedness is explored, where there is no escape from the disconnect between the finite and the Infinite, and this disconnect has been intellectually accepted but shunned in action by most people, with the concept of "original sin" being used to describe this disconnect.
- [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]] notes that individuals may appear to be living a fulfilling life, yet lack a true sense of self, instead being driven by external factors and worldly desires, which he terms "worldliness", and he also describes the phenomenon of thinkers creating grand systems and theories, yet failing to apply these principles to their own personal lives, instead living in a state of delusion.
- The concept of despair is defined by Kierkegaard as a state of double-mindedness, where an individual is torn between two conflicting wills, and this can lead to a sense of disintegration and fragmentation, a idea that is also described by St. Augustine and Cioran, who reference the struggle between their carnal and spiritual wills.
- Ultimately, the text concludes by describing how people often return to their ordinary lives after experiencing despair, but are never the same, and may acquire some understanding of life by imitating others, but ultimately live a life that is not truly their own, highlighting the inherent conflict between the natural and spiritual aspects of human existence.

---

## Inner Beauty and the Divided Self

- The concept of inner beauty and spiritual growth is emphasized by philosophers such as [[Plato]] and James, who argue that natural good is insufficient for true spiritual development and can even hinder it, while Buber and Molinos describe the tension between spiritual and natural aspects of human existence.
- The idea of the divided self is seen as a fundamental aspect of the human condition, where individuals are constantly pulled in opposing directions by their natural and transcendent natures, and this concept is not unique to any particular religious or philosophical tradition, but rather a universal human experience that is referenced in various spiritual and philosophical perspectives, including Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, and [[DarkNote/Nihilism]].

---

## The Divided Consciousness and Guilt

- The human consciousness is divided, resulting in a never-ending frustration that leads to feelings of guilt, as individuals are unable to live up to the ideals of philosophy, theology, or religion and are pulled back into the world's depravity, with Heidegger arguing that guilt stems from the "always falling" condition, where individuals are dragged down by naturalism and fail to recognize their True-Self.
- The Transcendent side of the Self, which separates itself from the Natural side of man, becomes the focus, leading to a renunciation of the world and a turning inward, as seen in the ideas of Cioran, [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], and the Tao Te Ching, which emphasize the importance of non-movement, non-action, and a negative "morality" that prioritizes spiritual growth over material concerns.
- The idea of prioritizing the Transcendent side of the Self is also echoed by Luther, who paraphrases Jesus' instruction to despise the world, highlighting the contrast between this perspective and the instruction to prioritize worldly concerns, and ultimately, the text suggests that the divided nature of human consciousness leads to a sense of guilt and frustration, which can only be alleviated by turning inward and prioritizing the Transcendent side of the Self.

---

## Nihilism, Morality, and Action

- The section discusses the concept of [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]] and its relation to human morality, action, and existence, citing various philosophers and thinkers, including [[Seraphim Rose]], Vivekananda, Otto, Taoism, Huxley, Cioran, Shestov, and [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], who all express a sense of disillusionment with human morality and the idea of progress.
- Seraphim Rose argues against "utopian" thinking and "doing good," emphasizing the importance of accepting the present moment and allowing God's will to be done, rather than trying to change the world through human action, while other thinkers, such as Vivekananda and Otto, also express a sense of futility and impermanence in human endeavors.
- The concept of "positivity" is critiqued as a form of escapism, arguing that it involves ignoring the true nature of existence and pretending that everything is fine when it is not, and the "Pathetic person" is described as someone who tries to hold on to a sense of hope and optimism, but ultimately surrenders to the futility of existence.
- In contrast, the Nihilist is portrayed as someone who confronts the reality of existence head-on, acknowledging the meaninglessness and impermanence of human endeavors, and refusing to pretend that everything is fine when it is not, with thinkers like Cioran, Shestov, and Kierkegaard arguing that true freedom and happiness can only be achieved by abandoning the idea of a meaningful or purposeful existence.
- The section suggests that the Nihilist's approach is more honest and authentic, even if it is often misunderstood as a form of laziness or despair, and that true wisdom and authenticity can only be achieved by confronting the reality of nihilism head-on, as emphasized by quotes from Kempus, [[Thomas Ligotti]], Theresa of Avila, [[Aldous Huxley]], and [[Emil Cioran]].

---

# Confronting Nihilism

- The need to confront and participate with [[DarkNote/Nihilism]] is highlighted, rather than fleeing from it, and this requires embracing the reality of the world's unreality, rather than hiding behind a facade of optimism or indifference, as illustrated by the story of the fishwife, which shows how people are often distracted by worldly pleasures and are unable to see beyond them.
- The concept of the "soulish-bodily synthesis" is explored, which is designed to strive for spiritual growth, but many individuals prefer to dwell in the "cellar" of sensuousness, rather than seeking a higher level of existence, and the concept of Nihilism is explored through various philosophical perspectives, including those of [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], [[Plato]], Taoism, Nagel, [[Albert Camus | Camus]], Heidegger, Spong, and Cioran.
- The concept of Nihilism is described as having a destructive nature, with individuals often avoiding the reality of their existence by dwelling in their own "cellar" of ignorance, as noted by Kierkegaard, and instead preferring to focus on superficial and selfish interpretations of life.

---

# The Authentic Self and Nihilism

- The illusory nature of value judgments is emphasized, leading to the Absurd, which can only be confronted through actualization, rather than intellectualization or reasoning, with proposed "solutions" such as irony or indifference being deemed ineffective.
- Philosophers like Camus, Heidegger, and Cioran discuss the human tendency to avoid confronting the Authentic Self and the reality of [[DarkNote/Nihilism]], with Camus describing the "absurd man" as one who accepts the universe in all its absurdity and draws strength from it.
- The individual who experiences Nihilism is unable to retreat back into the world of 'things' as they have become transparent and the world appears dead, as described by Tønnessen, who uses the analogy of a person falling from the Empire State Building to describe the human situation.
- The lack of philosophical inquiry in science is also highlighted, with many practicing scientists focusing on the 'How?' of scientific descriptions without asking the deeper philosophical questions of 'Why?', and philosophers like Nietzsche emphasizing the need for a more profound understanding of existence.
- The text also notes that humanist stoicism is seen as a temporary and ultimately futile attempt to cope with the implications of Nihilism, and that the fear of nothingness drives many forms of religion and the hysteria that ensues when theism is challenged, as observed by Spong.
- Ultimately, Nihilism is seen as wholly destructive to the world, revealing the abyss of nothingness that lies beneath human existence, and emphasizing the importance of confronting the agony of existence and the futility of seeking meaning in the end, rather than in the slow and revelatory process of living, as emphasized by Cioran.

---

# Limitations of Science and Humanism

- The philosophers mentioned in the text, including [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], [[Plato]], [[Albert Camus | Camus]], Heidegger, Tønnessen, [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], and Nietzsche, all contribute to the discussion of [[DarkNote/Nihilism]] and its implications for human existence, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of the world and our place in it.
- The section discusses the limitations of a scientific approach to understanding human experiences, such as music, arguing that it fails to capture the essence of the experience and can lead to a reduction of human nature to neural wiring and heredity, as noted by thinkers like Nietzsche and Ligotti.
- Several philosophers, including Cioran, Swami Vivekananda, and Heidegger, are cited as criticizing the limitations and potential dangers of a purely scientific approach, arguing that it can dull people's minds, diminish their metaphysical consciousness, and fail to provide a sense of purpose or meaning, with Heidegger suggesting that science needs an awakening itself to become a means of awakening the spirit.

---

# The Role of Philosophy

- The section also critiques traditional religious interpretations of the human condition, arguing that they often rely on ungrounded theological assumptions and provide simplistic answers to complex questions, rather than opening up the mystery of existence, as Heidegger suggests, and that philosophy is needed to open up the mystery of Being through the relentless pursuit of the "Why?".

---

# Death and Impermanence

- The passage discusses the concept of [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]] and the human experience, citing philosophers such as [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]] and Cioran, who highlight the superficiality of human virtues and the inevitability of death, with Kierkegaard noting that the self's attempts to create a sense of purpose and control ultimately resolve into nothing, and Cioran arguing that true understanding can only be achieved through a deep, existential awareness of mortality.
- The importance of contemplating death and the impermanence of human existence is emphasized by thinkers like Cioran, Ligotti, and Merton, who suggest that considering the perspective of death can provide a unique opportunity for objectivity and detachment, allowing individuals to approach questions with a greater degree of rigor and understanding, but this perspective is often difficult for people to adopt due to the need to prioritize objectivity over self-preservation.
- The issue of self-preservation and the human condition is often dismissed by the majority, including many scientists, as it is not considered a subject for rational debate and objective discussion, with thinkers like Heisman and [[Blaise Pascal]] highlighting the desperation and uncertainty that underlie human existence.

---

# Pascal's Wager and the Human Condition

- Pascal's Wager is not just a mathematical equation, but a desperate attempt to find meaning in a seemingly meaningless existence, where all finitudes are considered lost, and his insights are often reduced to a mathematical problem by intellectuals who miss the environment of desperation and uncertainty in which the wager is presented.
- The author argues that philosophical texts like Pascal's Wager and [[Allegory of the cave | Plato's Allegory of the Cave]] are essential for understanding the human condition, and that a Nihilistic language is needed to further develop and understand this condition, with the Allegory of the Cave being a powerful metaphor for the human condition and the limitations of knowledge.

## Ideals, Mysticism, and Nihilism
- Philosophers like [[Plato]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], as well as thinkers like Nietzsche, Heidegger, and [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], have proposed ideals of human existence that involve overcoming the limitations of human nature, but these ideals are ultimately unattainable, and mystical experiences, which are a foundational element of human experience, attempt to provide a reconciliation with the human situation, but are ultimately drowned out by the experience of [[DarkNote/Nihilism]].
- The experience of transcendence, as represented by Plato's Allegory of the Cave, is often accompanied by a feeling of "uncanniness," which is the opposite of the common human experience of feeling "at home" in the world, and philosophers like Zapffe argue that humans' casual attitude towards life is counter to the fundamental human condition, which is characterized by a "feeling of cosmic panic" in the face of the unknown and the impermanence of all things.
- The life-stories of historical figures like Buddha, and the writings of philosophers like Kierkegaard and Underhill, illustrate the human tendency to be deluded by the impermanence of all things and the uncertainty of life, and the experience of meaninglessness, as noted by Tillich, is more radical than mysticism, highlighting the profound impact of Nihilism on human existence.

# Tillich's Courage and the Experience of Nothingness

- The text explores the concept of nihilism and its relationship to the human experience, questioning the authenticity of Paul Tillich's emphasis on 'courage' in the face of nihilism and suggesting that it may be a facade or an attempt to flee from the experience of nothingness.
- The philosophy of Tillich is built upon despair and meaninglessness, yet his emphasis on 'courage' seems to contradict this, leading to questions about whether he truly believes in his own words or is preaching a 'happy' message for the masses, with other philosophers such as [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], [[Blaise Pascal | Pascal]], Cioran, and Unamuno expressing similar sentiments about the nature of faith, doubt, and the human experience.

# The Overwhelming Nature of Existence

- The text references various philosophers, including Tillich, Tønnessen, Shestov, Becker, [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], [[Albert Camus | Camus]], and Nietzsche, who suggest that a full understanding of human existence can be overwhelming and potentially destructive, and that humans are inherently flawed and that true awareness of this condition can lead to madness or despair.
- The concept of [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]] is explored in depth, with the idea that it is an inherent part of the human experience, and that even those who have experienced something mystical or transcendent are still subject to the ultimate skepticism and doubt that is built into the human situation, as highlighted by quotes from Shestov, Becker, and Kierkegaard.

# The Pursuit of Meaning and the Reality of Existence

- The pursuit of religion or spiritual enlightenment requires a deep-seated desire or thirst, as illustrated by a story from [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], and the distinction between the theoretician of faith and the believer is also discussed, with Cioran noting that the difference is as great as that between a psychiatrist and a psychotic.
- The text also explores the tension between the desire for meaning and the reality of existence, with quotes from Nietzsche, [[Blaise Pascal | Pascal]], and Cioran highlighting the human need for goals and the tendency to will nothingness rather than accept the void, and the concept of nihilism is distinguished from mental illness, with Heidegger noting that true anxiety is rare in a world dominated by superficiality and publicness.
- The rejection of the worldly is seen as a necessary step in understanding the experience of nothingness, but this position is also acknowledged as being difficult to comprehend, and the quotes from various philosophers throughout the text serve to illustrate the complexities and challenges of grappling with the human condition, and the need for a deep and profound understanding of existence.
- Ultimately, the concept of [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]] is deeply rooted in the human condition, and its profound implications cannot be alleviated by psychotherapeutic means, as stated by St. Augustine, highlighting the need for a more profound and spiritual understanding of the human experience.

# Nihilism as a Spiritual Disorder

- The concept of nihilism is viewed as a spiritual disorder by [[Seraphim Rose]], who believes it can only be overcome by spiritual means, whereas Ernest Becker's perspective highlights the inherent fear and trembling that comes with acknowledging the fragility of life and the powerlessness of individuals.
- Mitchell Heisman argues that nihilism is an incurable aspect of the human condition, and his own documented case of suicide raises questions about the possibility of living a philosophy of nihilism and whether it would lead to rational self-destruction.
- Heisman's two-thousand-page suicide note expresses his pursuit of a new language of nihilism, characterized by honesty to the point of absurdity, and his desire to seek out truths that are deadly and destructive to himself, ultimately leading to rational self-annihilation.

---

# Madness, Suicide, and Nihilism

- The relationship between madness, suicide, and [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]] is explored, with questions raised about whether madness and suicide are necessary consequences of nihilism, and whether there is a difference between a worldly suicide and one resulting from nihilism.
- The concept of nihilism can only be escaped through the exercise of faith, but the notion of faith is complex and open to interpretation, as seen in the differing views of thinkers like Heisman and Underhill, with Kierkegaard's definition of faith as "the opposite of sin" highlighting the idea that faith is not about virtue, but rather about experiencing something beyond the nothingness of the world.

---

# Nihilism, Faith, and Language

- Heisman's interpretation of nihilism lacks a transcendent aspect, instead focusing on a naturalistic view, whereas Underhill's perspective incorporates the idea of faith as a means to move beyond the nothingness of the world, and Heisman's writings reveal sentiments similar to those expressed by saints and religiously-minded individuals, but without the framework of a religious language.
- The question arises as to whether a language that encompasses both Heisman's and the saints' perspectives could have allowed Heisman to live a different life, and whether a nihilistic language necessarily entails suicide, with the text emphasizing that Heisman's actions should not be judged, and the focus is on exploring the complexities of nihilism and the role of faith in escaping its horrors.

---

# Authentic Suicide and Nihilism

- The concept of authentic suicide is explored in relation to [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]], where the act of taking one's life can be considered authentic when driven by a profound understanding of the nothingness of the world, rather than a loss of worldly distractions.
- A distinction is made between individuals who are slaves to the world and those who have experienced nihilism, with the former often fleeing into suicide as a relief from their suffering, while the latter may see suicide as a logical conclusion to their existence, as noted by philosophers such as Peter Zapffe and [[Søren Kierkegaard]].
- The development of a nihilistic language of transcendence is questioned, with some arguing that it may not be worth the effort, and that the nihilistic suicide may be the optimal decision, as it is not a fleeing from the world, but rather a release into the divine, a concept also discussed by Zapffe.

---

# The Sickness Unto Death

- The idea is presented that those who have experienced the nothingness of the world may lose interest in worldly activities and distractions, and instead seek to surround themselves with the experience of meaninglessness, as it is a more authentic reflection of their reality, a concept Kierkegaard refers to as the "sickness unto death".
- The text uses metaphors, such as people carrying buckets of water from a river to a campground, to describe how individuals cope with the inevitability of death and the meaninglessness of life, with some people being more aware of their condition than others, and ultimately, all the water will be lost, and all meaning will fade away.

---

# The Logic of Life and Suicide

- The logic of life and the logic of suicide are presented as a dichotomy, with the latter being incomprehensible to those who have not experienced the nothingness of existence, and philosophers such as [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], Cioran, and Tillich describe the experience of despair and the desire for death as a result of confronting the abyss of nothingness.
- The text concludes by suggesting that reason leads to skepticism, skepticism to despair, and despair to [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]], which opens up the possibility of experiencing the "Other", a terrifyingly strange and divine experience of meaninglessness, and that phenomena such as depression and fear of life may not be signs of a pathological state, but rather messages from a deeper sense of life that is at odds with the biological drive to survive, as argued by Zapffe.

---

# Nihilism and the Spiritual Journey

- The concept of nihilism and its effects on individuals who embark on a spiritual journey is discussed, citing philosophers and writers such as Kierkegaard, [[Plato]], St. Francis de Sales, Cioran, Underhill, Nietzsche, and Tillich, who suggest that embracing madness could be a realization of an ideal or a never-ending adventure into the unknown.
- According to various philosophers, individuals who pursue a spiritual path may be viewed as hypocrites or mad by others, with Kierkegaard noting that the higher they ascend, the more appalling the hypocrisy may seem, and Plato describing such individuals as being "possessed by god" and detached from worldly concerns.
- The section highlights the superficiality of an unthinking life, where people prioritize fleeting pleasures over meaningful experiences and ignore the suffering of others, with Cioran's quotes emphasizing the emptiness and boredom that can lead to self-destruction, but also suggesting that nihilism can be a catalyst for finding something meaningful.

---

# Transcendent Nothingness

- The concept of "Transcendent Nothingness" is referenced, describing an experience that breaks into ordinary reality, evoking feelings of nothingness and the sublime, with philosophers like Tillich, Otto, Shestov, Cioran, and Swami Rama characterizing [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]] as having both a Naturalistic and a Transcendent component.
- The Transcendent aspect of Nihilism is described as an experience that goes beyond the boundaries of the world, allowing for a confrontation with the "Other" and a sense of the divine, with philosophers like Cioran and Tozer suggesting that this experience requires a renunciation of worldly distractions and a pursuit of the Nothingness, leading to a "clearing of the path" and a possibility of transfiguration.
- The Naturalistic interpretation of Nihilism is seen as incomplete, providing only a "diminished" version of the experience, whereas the Transcendent aspect offers a "fuller" experience that is rarely explored or experienced, with quotes from Underhill, Nietzsche, and Tillich touching on the idea that the human experience is marked by a capacity for mental anguish and a lack of reason to believe in a true world.

---

# Nihilism and Naturalism

- The relationship between Nihilism and naturalism is complex, with some arguing that Nihilism cannot be reduced to naturalism, as it has distinct characteristics that go beyond naturalism, and the possibility of empirical data supporting the Transcendent aspect of Nihilism is raised, with philosophers like Nietzsche questioning the existence of a "true world".

---

# The Mystical Aspect of Nihilism

- The Nihilistic experience has a mystical aspect, which allows for an "opening up" of the Other and a sense of the divine, characterized by the eradication of the ego, where the worldly 'I' is erased, yet something that resembles a 'you' remains, and there is a meeting with a 'bigger something', as described in the fully Transcendent forms of [[DarkNote/Nihilism]].
- The Augmented form of Nihilism is a true 'opening up' of the Transcendent, coinciding with what is normally labeled as 'mystical', and it is not in conflict with the naturalistic aspect of Nihilism, but rather they differ in pure experience, with the external appearance of Augmented Nihilism being an encounter with the Other, and the naturalistic aspect being a message coming from within the world.

---

# Mysticism and the Pursuit of Quiet

- According to philosophers like Cioran and Underhill, mysticism does not derive from a softening of the instincts, but rather from a strong and active engagement, and true "Quiet" is a means, not an end, and is actively embraced, not passively endured, as it is a phase in the self's growth in contemplation, with suffering being seen as a catalyst for spiritual growth.
- The Augmented aspect of the Nihilistic experience is often hidden due to a lack of participation or pursued confrontation with the Other, and many people have misconceptions about it due to a lack of personal experience, as stated by Tillich, who suggests that one must empty themselves of all finite contents of their ordinary life and surrender all preliminary concerns for the sake of the ultimate concern to achieve a mystical experience.

---

# The Psychedelic Journey and Augmented Nihilism

- Training and practice, such as meditation and contemplation, can change the structure of our spiritual experiences, and traditional practices of spirituality, such as studying poetry, counterpoint, or mathematical reasoning, can evoke feelings of beauty and significance, but they may not be the only way to experience a deeper connection with the unknown, as the author suggests that the psychedelic journey, specifically with psilocybin, can provide a more direct and intense experience of the abyss of existence.
- The psychedelic journey can lead to a confrontation with the "Other", resulting in an experience of Augmented [[DarkNote/Nihilism]], which can be overwhelming and terrifying, leading to a strong motivation to move past it and find ways to cover up the feeling of nothingness, often by throwing oneself into worldly activities, but this attempt to move past the experience can lead to confusion and discord, as finite human language is insufficient to describe the "Wholly-Other" and can only provide symbolic representations.

---

# The Limitations of Language

- The author discusses the limitations of language in describing the "Other", quoting [[Martin Buber]], who states that any experience, no matter how spiritual, can only yield an "It", highlighting the inability of language to fully capture the essence of the Other.

---

# Encountering the Other

- The author shares a personal experience of encountering the Other, describing it as a timeless, ultimate unity that felt like being "at home" and infinitely satisfied, but also acknowledges the fear and paralysis that can come with the experience, and raises questions about what happens when one meets the Other but is still not convinced or does not know what to do.
- The author suggests that concrete symbols of Transcendence are dead, and that the experience of the Other cannot be easily dismissed as an illusion or a trick of the mind, quoting [[Aldous Huxley]], who states that mescaline can open up the way to contemplation, but shuts the door on action and the will to action, highlighting the tension between the experience of the Other and the demands of the everyday world.

---

# Nihilism and the Dissolution of the Ego

- The experience of [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]] is described as a dissolution of the ego, where the worldly self concerned with security, money, and relationships dissipates, allowing for a confrontation with the infinite and the wholly Other, which requires a renunciation of the ego and worldly desires, and can be facilitated by experiencing the Nothing of the world, a state of pure consciousness that is One with all existence.
- The Buddhist concept of Emptiness is described as Absolute Emptiness, transcending all forms of mutual relationship, subject and object, birth and death, and is characterized as a zero full of infinite possibilities, and the preparation for this confrontation begins with renouncing worldly attachments and embracing the Nothing of the world, allowing for a clearer experience of the Other.
- The dissolution of the 'I' brings forth a feeling of Unity, a pure consciousness that is One with all existence, and is described as a state of being no one, yet being everyone, and being no self, yet being the true Self, which is associated with the freedom to manifest God through one's own uniqueness.
- The self-life, or ego, is seen as an enemy that must be overcome, as it is characterized by possessiveness and a desire for gain and profit, and the experience of confronting the infinite and the wholly Other is described as a terrifying bliss, a state of panic that can be unrecognizable, and is not something that can be easily put into words, with quotes from various authors, including Huxley, Suzuki, Keating, Tozer, Cioran, and C.S., used to illustrate the nature of this experience and the importance of renouncing the ego and worldly attachments.

# The Terror and Bliss of Nihilism

- The experience of [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]] is characterized by a profound sense of terror, horror, and desolation, as described by philosophers and mystics such as Lewis, Otto, Tolstoy, and Molinos, who liken it to a spiritual martyrdom and a journey through Hell, with mysticism revolving around the passion for ecstasy and a horror of the void.
- To guide oneself through this confrontation with nihilism, music, particularly abstract and wordless music, is recommended as a suitable medium, with the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach | Bach]], specifically his organ works, being highlighted as a prime example, allowing the listener to experience the Other and the ultimate order.

# Music as a Medium of Transfiguration

- The music of Bach is seen as a medium of heavenly transfiguration, generating divinity and providing a sense of the existence of God, with Cioran's quotes emphasizing the divine nature of Bach's music and suggesting that listening to it is a way to experience the existence of God.
- Music can also be seen as a form of emotional technology, allowing individuals to control their behavior intelligently, and as a counter to the tendency to view everything as material or technology, with Heisman describing how listening to music, particularly German music by composers such as Wagner and Bach, serves as a form of technology that counters his own material self-consistency.

# Plato's Beauty and the Divided-Self

- The concept of Plato's beauty and the divided-self is relevant to the concept of Augmented [[DarkNote/Nihilism]], where the soul is pierced and maddened by the recollection of beauty, and is oppressed by the strangeness of its condition, leading to a state of madness and desire, and highlighting the need for a new language to address the Nothing.
- The Nihilist experience is characterized by the inability to turn to the dead world of distractions, and the need to develop a new language to address the Nothing, with the world's religions and philosophy providing some help but ultimately being insufficient, and requiring a new kind of theology based on personal experience and spiritual transformation, as highlighted by [[Aldous Huxley]].
- Ultimately, the text concludes that philosophy and conceptual thinking can help pave the way for a better understanding of the ineffable, but the individual must renounce their values and show true humility in the face of the Nothing, leading to a Quietist contemplative existence, with no new knowledge gained, but rather a deeper understanding and acceptance of the unknown.

# The Psychedelic Experience and Meaninglessness

- The psychedelic experience often leads to a mystical experience that confirms the meaninglessness of the world, a concept closely related to Nihilism, as described by philosophers such as Buddha, who believed that this experience can be achieved through a state of abstraction, leading to an apprehension of emptiness and boundless knowledge.

# The Transcendent Experience of Nihilism

- The Transcendent experience of [[DarkNote/Nihilism]] involves encountering Nothingness, which is described by Pseudo-Dionysius as the Cause of all things, yet itself is nothing, and by [[Aldous Huxley]] as the Nothing of oneself, characterized by a sense of triviality and shoddiness, and a realization that one's personal self is connected to human pretensions and is worth nothing.
- Mystical experiences, including those of Nihilism, are not about belief or developing a system, but rather about accepting the infinite and the mystery that lies beyond human understanding, and are often described as "strange, weird, uncanny, significant, and terrifying beyond belief" by authors such as Smith, highlighting the incompatibility between human egotism and divine purity.

# The Subjectivity of Nihilism

- The experience of Nihilism is subjective and must be dealt with on an individual level, as expressed by Huxley's phrase "In life, man proposes, God disposes", and is not comparable to anything in the physical world, evoking a fear of being overwhelmed and disintegrating under the pressure of reality.
- Philosophers and theologians often prioritize rationality over direct experience, leading to stagnation and frustration in their pursuit of understanding, as suggested by Ligotti, who implies that few have explored beyond rationality, and that mystical-type experiences can be induced in anyone willing to undertake the task with proper psychological preparation and setting.
- The author's personal experience with psychedelics confirms the philosophy of [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]], but acknowledges that this does not prove anything, and that one is ultimately left with the "Nothing of the world" upon returning to their normal state of consciousness, highlighting the importance of individual experience and the limitations of human language in describing mystical experiences.

# The Tension Between the Spiritual and the Mundane

- The section explores the concept of nihilism and its relationship with the human experience, citing various philosophers and thinkers, including Theresa, [[Martin Buber]], [[Ernest Becker]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and others, who discuss the tension between the spiritual and the mundane.
- The thinkers mentioned in the section, such as Theresa and Buber, express the distress of returning to the world after experiencing a higher level of consciousness and note that genuine contemplation is fleeting, leading to a loss of actuality and a sense of disconnection from the world.
- The section also touches on the idea of the limitations of language and the unknowability of nihilism, suggesting that language and thought can be inadequate in capturing the essence of nihilism, and that concepts like "Being-towards-death" and "dialectical silence" highlight the uncertainty and ambiguity of the human condition.

# The Unknowability of Nihilism

- The idea of expressing the experience of [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]] in simple terms is rejected as a cliché, and instead, the section emphasizes the need for a more nuanced and authentic approach to understanding nihilism, which is reflected in the thoughts of thinkers like Heidegger, Cioran, and Spong.
- The discussion of nihilism often misses the deeper message and experience, which cannot be fully captured by words, making it challenging to develop a language that conveys its essence, as seen in the experiences of St. Therese of Lisieux and others who have struggled to express the inexpressible.

# The Affirmative Substance of Nihilism

- The experience of nihilism is not equivalent to renouncing the world or committing suicide, but rather it involves using suicide as a means to confront the Nothing, and the concept of an "affirmative substance" within the experience of nihilism, as described by Cioran, suggests that there is a positive expression of nothingness that can be found.
- Ultimately, the section raises more questions than it answers, leaving the reader with a sense of uncertainty and the need for further exploration and contemplation, and highlighting the need to develop a new language that can break through the limitations of current understandings and provide a more adequate account of the human experience.

# Nihiltheism and a New Language

- The concept of Nihiltheism is introduced as a potential grounding for the human experience of [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]], requiring the development of a new language that is symbolic, self-critical, and open to re-interpretation, and not strictly based on myth, tradition, or empirical facts.
- This language can be informed by the philosophical ideas of [[Martin Heidegger]], particularly his concepts of anxiety, moments of vision, and authenticity, as outlined in his work "Being and Time", which provides a foundation for understanding the human condition in a non-naturalistic yet grounded manner.
- Heidegger's concept of "Being-Towards-Death" is a key aspect of his analysis, involving anxiety, a call of conscience, and a moment of vision that pushes the individual to strive for resoluteness and discover their True-Self, and can be seen as a foundation for developing a language of nihilism.

# Being-Towards-Death and the True-Self

- The ideas of Heidegger and [[Thomas Merton]], a Trappist monk, show similarities in their rejection of outward-seeking for meaning and their emphasis on embracing the inner emptiness and nothingness of human existence, highlighting the need for a language that reconciles superficial disparities between atheistic and theistic perspectives.
- A nihilistic language would aim to provide a framework for understanding the human condition in a way that is not limited by traditional labels, and would involve a confrontation with the terror of existence, the experience of the nothingness of human existence, and the ultimately empty structure of naturalism.
- The concept of the True-Self must be interpreted in a way that avoids naturalistic and worldly explanations, as well as traditional conceptions of God, and Heidegger's ontological analysis of conscience is prior to any description or classification of experiences of conscience, lying outside of biological explanations and theological exegesis.
- The development of a language of [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]] requires a new way of thinking and experiencing, one that is grounded in the experience of the terror of existence and the unending questioning of "why?", and must be open to the mystery of the "Why" and the phenomenal findings of human existence.
- Ultimately, the goal of a nihilistic language is to bring one face to face with the nightmare of existence, rather than rescuing one from the nothingness, and to provide a means of exploring the human condition in a way that is honest, self-critical, and open to re-interpretation.

# Optimism as Idolatry

- The concept of optimism is viewed as a form of idolatry that turns away from nihilism, providing an illusion of comfort by distracting from the reality of nothingness, and this phenomenon is particularly evident in worldly religions and certain cultural and religious forms, such as the 'optimism' and 'prosperity churches' found in American culture.
- In contrast to the nihilism that arises from the abyss, Christian nihilism, as described by [[Seraphim Rose]], posits that a Christian can be considered a "nihilist" in the sense that they believe the world is nothing and God is all, highlighting a fundamental difference between these two perspectives on nihilism.

# Unthinking Scientism and the Role of Philosophy

- The lack of philosophical inquiry in modern science is criticized as "unthinking scientism," which neglects deeper questions about existence and instead focuses on formal descriptions of reality, a trend that is also observed in traditional religious interpretations of the human condition, which often rely on ungrounded theological assumptions.
- The philosopher's role is to question the underlying reasons for the patterns and structures observed in the physical world, and this relentless questioning is necessary to open up the mystery of Being, rather than closing it off, as is often the case with religious languages and traditional interpretations of human experience.

# Anxiety and the Insignificance of the World

- The concept of anxiety plays a crucial role in disclosing the insignificance of the world, revealing that the threatening aspect of existence does not come from entities within the world, but rather from the fact that these entities have sunk into insignificance, and this experience of anxiety highlights the worldhood of the world, which remains significant in the face of the insignificance of entities within it, as discussed in the context of Heidegger's thought.
- The state of profound boredom prompts the question of the existence of beings, leading to the inquiry of why there are beings at all instead of nothing, as it lays open a wasteland where the presence or absence of beings makes no difference.

# Dread and the Presence of No-Thing

- Dread is a fundamental aspect of human existence that makes being as a whole untenable, and although its presence is often suppressed, it continues to exist, even in individuals who are busy or apprehensive, and is a manifestation of the permanent and obscured presence of no-thing.
- The experience of [[DarkNote/Nihilism| nihilism]] discloses the original dread, which is a manifestation of the permanent and obscured presence of no-thing, and this presence is the basis of the beholdenness of existence to no-thing, ultimately leading to the transcendence of being as a whole.

# Being as a Whole

- Human existence is characterized by the impossibility of grasping the whole of be-ing in itself, but individuals can find themselves in the midst of be-ing as a whole, which occurs frequently in everyday life, even in the midst of mundane activities.
- Profound boredom, as a state of existence, reveals be-ing as a whole, pulling everything into it with remarkable indifference, and it is in this state that the unity of be-ing as a whole is overcome, albeit only in the shadows, allowing for a unique perspective on the nature of existence.
