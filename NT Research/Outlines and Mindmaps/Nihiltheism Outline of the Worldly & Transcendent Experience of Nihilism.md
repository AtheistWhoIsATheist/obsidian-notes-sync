* * *

<br>

## Outline

I. **Nihilism and the Meaninglessness of Human Existence:** - Meaninglessness of life and the absence of serious engagement with religion in most people's lives. - The significance of religion for many individuals, providing meaning, purpose, and coping mechanisms. - Accepting the meaninglessness of life liberates us from the pursuit of meaning in all actions.

<br>

II. **Nihiltheism: Embracing Nothingness and Transcendence:** - Nihiltheism combines traditional nihilism with the view of Nothingness as a construct or embodiment of the Transcendent/Divine. - It involves actively engaging with Nothingness in the physical world as a reminder of Transcendence. - Nihiltheism connects with various philosophical and religious traditions, including existentialists, Christian mystics, and Eastern philosophies. - Figures like Emil Cioran and Paul Tillich share common ground under Nihiltheism's lens.

<br>

III. **The Pursuit and Participation with Temporal Nihility:** - Nihiltheism suggests immersing oneself in existential despair to fully comprehend it. - It acknowledges the impossibility of participating in this state for an extended period. - This pursuit of Temporal Nihility is found in different thinkers and traditions, such as William James, Soren Kierkegaard, and Plato. - Nihiltheism considers the Nothingness of the physical world as an undeniable reality.

<br>

IV. **The Transcendent: Encountering the Wholly Other:** - Psychedelics play a role in Nihiltheism, triggering Transcendent experiences that align with its principles. - Entheogens offer an encounter with an "Infinite Presence" and a union with Everything. - These experiences reveal an incorporeal realm of Nothingness, described as "Full" or "Plentiful" Emptiness or Void. - The encounters with Transcendence bring a sense of familiarity and "coming home."

<br>

V. **The Return: Navigating the Tension:** - The fleeting connection to the Transcendent leads to a retreat to mundane reality and existential fears. - Nihiltheists experience a constant reminder of life's fleeting nature and worldly insignificance. - Morality in Nihiltheism involves a state of "non-movement" and non-engagement with the world. - Extreme interpretations view moral values as nonexistent and encourage utmost moral inaction.

<br>

VI. **Conclusion: The Nihiltheistic Paradox:** - Nihiltheism rejects attempts to move past Nihilism, considering it an evasion of a fundamental existence. - It emphasizes the pursuit, participation, and renunciation of the Nothingness of the world. - Warning against finding meaning in the meaningless leads to deeper illusions and inauthentic states of being. - Nihiltheism stresses the importance of examining existence and preparing for inevitable death, as put forth by Plato.

# Defining Correlation between the Worldly & Transcendent Experiences of Nihilism

Transcendence is presented as a concept distinct from traditional "religious" experiences, offering a broader and less dogmatic framework for exploring experiences that go beyond the purely material or naturalistic. It suggests that the experience of nihilism, often associated with negativity and despair, can act as a catalyst for a transformative journey towards a higher state of consciousness. This transformative potential of nihilism is rooted in the confrontation with nothingness, which can serve as a gateway to a deeper, more profound understanding of existence.

The sources highlight the paradoxical nature of this transcendent state, often described as an encounter with an "Infinite Presence" or the "Other". This encounter is characterized by a sense of both terror and bliss, a simultaneous experience of dissolution of the self and a profound connection to a reality that transcends individual existence. This echoes mystical experiences across various traditions, suggesting a common thread in the human experience of transcendence.

The sources acknowledge the significant challenge of articulating this transcendent experience through language. The ineffable nature of this encounter pushes the boundaries of human comprehension and linguistic capabilities. However, the sources also emphasize the importance of developing a new language, one that is symbolic and self-critical, to navigate and express the complexities and transcendental yearnings elicited by the encounter with nothingness. This language would need to transcend the limitations of traditional religious and philosophical frameworks to adequately capture the essence of transcendence.
