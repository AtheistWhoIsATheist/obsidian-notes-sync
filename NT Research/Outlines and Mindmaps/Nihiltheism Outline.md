# !!!IMPORTANT!!! 

- Asked HARPA to Rewrite  ‘HARPA V2’ by stating: _“I need you to go back to the previous rewrite yet, I need you to make additions of relevant thinkers, both philosophical and religious, in order to create the most robust, all encompassing definition of Nihiltheism!  My career depends on this definition!”_

# Nihiltheism: A Comprehensive Ontological and Phenomenological Paradigm

# [[summary]]

* * *

## I. Introduction: The Existential Nexus

Nihiltheism operates as an intricate ontological and phenomenological schema, contending assiduously with existential dilemmas along bifurcated strata:

1. **Corporeal Realms of Ontological Vacuity**: Here, thinkers like Friedrich Nietzsche and E.M. Coiran resonate.
2. **Elusive Transcendent Reality**: Mystics such as Miguel Molinos and other Christian Saints offer insights into this dimension.

* * *

## II. Philosophical Praxis: A Confrontation with Nihility

This doctrinal edifice amalgamates:

- **Canonical Nihilistic Weltanschauung**: Featuring the perspectives of philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Arthur Schopenhauer.
- **Provocative Postulation of Transcendent Numen**: Supported by religious figures like St. Teresa of Ávila and Adi Shankaracharya [Adi Shankaracharya](Adi Shankaracharya.md "upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=EA89D9D8-F418-4504-9B5D-76000D67865D").

It transcends circumscribed intellectual apprehension, advocating for:

- **Viscerally Poignant Immersion**: As in the works of Fyodor Dostoevsky.
- **Lived Phenomenological Actualization**: Similar to the ideas of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Emmanuel Levinas.

* * *

## III. Ascetic Comportment: The Ontological Harbinger

Nihiltheism incites a deliberate dialectical interplay with corporeal Nihility, adopting:

- **Ascetic Comportment**: Echoing the lifestyle choices of Diogenes and St. John of the Cross.
- **Ontological Harbinger of the Transcendent**: As expressed in the Kabbalistic tradition and Sufism.
- **Conduit for Abnegation of the Profane**: In line with Gnostic beliefs and certain interpretations of Zen Buddhism.

* * *

## IV. Interdisciplinary Resonance: A Confluence of Philosophical and Theological Matrices

This conceptual framework finds resonant confluence with:

- **Existential Luminaries**: Such as Søren Kierkegaard and Martin Heidegger.
- **Christian Esotericists**: Including Meister Eckhart and Miguel de Molinos.
- **Eastern Metaphysical Ontologies**: Featuring paradigms like Buddhism, Vedanta, and Taoism, along with key figures like Nagarjuna and Laozi.

* * *

## V. Valorization of Despair: An Existential Imperative

In contradistinction to evasive ontological paradigms, Nihiltheism promulgates:

- **Valorization of Existential Despair**: Supported by the thoughts of Blaise Pascal and Sigmund Freud.
- **Cognizance of Vicissitudes in Prolonged Immersion**: As discussed by William James and Carl Jung.

It reverberates with historical sentiments, including:

- **William James' 'Divided-Self'**
- **Kierkegaard's 'Double-Mindedness'**
- **Judeo-Christian 'Original Sin'**: As interpreted by Augustine and Thomas Aquinas.

* * *

## VI. Epistemological Interrogation: The Scientistic Paradigm

Nihiltheism rigorously interrogates:

- **Prevailing Scientistic Paradigm**: Questioning figures like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris.
- **Capacity to Elucidate Existential Conundrums**: With insights from cognitive science and phenomenology.

Prominence is given to entheogens for:

- **Catalyzing Transcendent Epiphanies**: As explored by Terence McKenna and Aldous Huxley.
- **Annihilation of Egoic Structures**: As theorized by Ken Wilber and Ram Dass.
- **Cosmic Interconnectedness**: Supported by the ecological philosophies of Arne Naess and Vandana Shiva.

* * *

## VII. Ethical Stasis: A Radical Axiological Extension

The Nihiltheistic life trajectory espouses:

- **Ethical Stasis akin to Taoist Wu Wei**: As articulated by Zhuangzi.
- **Pacifistic Non-Engagement**: As in the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy.
- **Preliminary Ontological Gambit in Disavowal of Worldly Entanglements**: Supported by the Stoic philosophies of Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus.

* * *

## VIII. Conclusion: An Intellectual Crucible for Existential Inquiry

Nihiltheism serves as an intellectual crucible where:

- **Existential Disquietude**: Explored by figures like Hannah Arendt and Erich Fromm.
- **Ethical Aporia**: As examined by Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor.
- **Transcendent Awe**: Found in the writings of Mircea Eliade and Rudolf Otto.

coalesce into a potent phenomenological amalgam, compelling a radical reassessment of foundational ontological and axiological presuppositions.
