# Research Plan: Expanding the Philosophy of Nihiltheism

<br>

## 1\. Introduction

<br>

### Define Nihiltheism

Nihiltheism is a philosophical perspective that combines the concepts of Nihilism (the belief in the ultimate meaninglessness of existence) and Theism (the belief in a deity or deities). It posits that the divine or transcendent is intimately connected to the concept of Nothingness, creating a paradoxical relationship between existence and non-existence.

<br>

### Significance

Expanding Nihiltheism can bridge the gap between atheistic existentialism and traditional theism, offering a unique approach to understanding the human condition and our place in the universe. This research aims to contribute to the growing field of existential philosophy and provide new insights into the nature of belief, meaning, and transcendence.

<br>

### Research Objectives & Questions

**1\. Explore the philosophical underpinnings of Nihiltheism:**

   - What are the core tenets of Nihiltheism?

   - How does Nihiltheism reconcile the apparent contradiction between Nihilism and Theism?

   - What role does the concept of Nothingness play in Nihiltheism?

<br>

**2\. Examine the relationship between Nihilism, Theism, and Nihiltheism:**

   - How does Nihiltheism build upon or diverge from traditional Nihilism and Theism?

   - What unique insights does Nihiltheism offer that are not present in either Nihilism or Theism alone?

   - How might Nihiltheism address criticisms commonly leveled at both Nihilism and Theism?

<br>

**3\. To analyze the implications of Nihiltheism for existentialism, spirituality, and the human experience:**

   - How does Nihiltheism impact our understanding of meaning and purpose in life?

   - What are the psychological and emotional consequences of adopting a Nihiltheistic worldview?

   - How might Nihiltheism influence spiritual practices and religious beliefs?

<br>

## 2\. Literature Review

<br>

### Survey Existing Literature

\- Conduct a comprehensive review of literature on Nihilism, focusing on key works such as Nietzsche's "The Gay Science" and "Thus Spoke Zarathustra," Camus' "The Myth of Sisyphus," and Sartre's "Being and Nothingness."

\- Review major works in Theism, including classical texts like Aquinas' "Summa Theologica" and modern theologians like Paul Tillich's "The Courage to Be."

\- Examine existing literature on Nihiltheism, including any academic papers, books, or online resources that directly address this concept.

<br>

### Identify Gaps

\- Analyze the current state of research on Nihiltheism, noting areas where the concept is underdeveloped or unexplored.

\- Identify specific questions or aspects of Nihiltheism that have not been adequately addressed in existing literature.

\- Consider interdisciplinary gaps, such as the lack of research on the psychological impacts of Nihiltheism or its potential applications in fields like cognitive science or neurophilosophy.

<br>

### Integrate/Diverge

**\- Discuss how Nihiltheism integrates elements from Nihilism and Theism:**

  \* Explore how Nihiltheism incorporates the Nihilistic concept of meaninglessness with the Theistic notion of a higher power.

  \* Analyze how Nihiltheism reinterprets traditional religious concepts through a Nihilistic lens.

\- Examine how Nihiltheism diverges from these traditional philosophies:

  \* Investigate how Nihiltheism challenges both the atheistic conclusions of many Nihilists and the meaning-affirming aspects of traditional Theism.

  \* Explore unique concepts within Nihiltheism that are not present in either Nihilism or Theism alone.

<br>

## 3\. Theoretical Framework

<br>

### Philosophical Underpinnings

\- Explore the concept of Nothingness in depth, drawing from sources such as Heidegger's "What is Metaphysics?" and Buddhist philosophy.

\- Analyze the nature of transcendence within Nihiltheism, comparing it to traditional religious and philosophical conceptions.

\- Investigate the role of existential despair in Nihiltheism, considering how it differs from or aligns with existentialist thinkers like Kierkegaard and Sartre.

\- Examine the paradoxical nature of the divine in Nihiltheism, exploring how it relates to concepts like the Absolute in Hegelian philosophy or Śūnyatā in Buddhism.

<br>

### Key Thinkers & Texts

**\- Identify philosophers whose work, while not explicitly Nihiltheistic, has contributed to its development:**

  \* Friedrich Nietzsche: "The Gay Science," "Thus Spoke Zarathustra"

  \* Martin Heidegger: "Being and Time," "What is Metaphysics?"

  \* Ray Brassier's "Nihil Unbound: Enlightenment and Extinction"

  \* Eugene Thacker's "In The Dust of This Planet"

  \* Thomas Ligotti's "The Conspiracy Against the Human Race"

<br>

### Existential Despair & Transcendence

**\- Analyze the role of existential despair within Nihiltheism:**

  \* How does Nihiltheism frame the experience of existential despair?

  \* In what ways might despair be seen as a path to transcendence within this philosophy?

**\- Explore the potential for transcendence within Nihiltheism:**

  \* How does Nihiltheism conceive of transcendence in relation to Nothingness?

  \* What practices or experiences might facilitate transcendence within a Nihiltheistic framework?

**\- Examine the paradoxical nature of finding meaning in meaninglessness:**

  \* How might the acceptance of ultimate meaninglessness lead to a profound sense of freedom or peace?

  \* In what ways does Nihiltheism offer a unique perspective on the human search for meaning?
