# Outline of The Universal Nature of the Experience of Nihilism

⁠⁠  
## Introduction  
\- \*\*Thesis Statement\*\*: The experience of Nihilism is a universal aspect of human existence, transcending time, culture, and individual belief systems. This essay will demonstrate how diverse thinkers from various epochs and backgrounds articulate a shared encounter with existential meaninglessness, offering profound insights into the human condition.  

## Points of Convergence

### I. Confrontation with Meaninglessness  
1\. \*\*St. Augustine\*\*:   
   - \*\*Despair of Worldly Things\*\*: “...sent to set us an example of despising worldly things for the attainment of immortality.”  
   - \*\*Existential Realization\*\*: “Suddenly every vain hope became worthless to me.”  
   - \*\*Confrontation with Death\*\*: “At this grief my heart was utterly darkened; and whatever I beheld was death.”  
2\. \*\*Martin Luther\*\*:   
   - \*\*Existential Despair\*\*: "God forbid! Even if God were to offer me paradise in order that I might last forty more years in this life, I wouldn't want it. I'd rather hire a hangman to knock my head off. That's how bad the world is now. It's full of nothing but devils."  
3\. \*\*Albert Camus\*\*:   
   - \*\*Consciousness of the Absurd\*\*: "A man who has become conscious of the absurd is forever bound to it."  
   - \*\*Monotony of Life\*\*: "Rising, streetcar, four hours in the office or the factory, meal, streetcar, four hours of work, meal, sleep, and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday according to the same rhythm—this path is easily followed most of the time. But one day the 'why' arises and everything begins in that weariness tinged with amazement."  
4\. \*\*Emil Cioran\*\*:   
   - \*\*Existential Isolation and Despair\*\*: "There are experiences which one cannot survive, after which one feels that there is no meaning left in anything. Once you have reached the limits of life, having lived to extremity all that is offered at those dangerous borders, the everyday gesture and the usual aspiration lose their seductive charm."  
5\. \*\*Leo Tolstoy\*\*:   
   - \*\*The Meaninglessness of Life\*\*: “...my life considered in relation to my individual happiness is taken by itself a stupendous farce and that this meaningless existence will end in a stupid death.”  
   - \*\*Despair and Hope\*\*: “I was able to breathe to eat to drink to sleep. I could not indeed help doing so; but there was no real life in me.”  
<br>
### II. Spiritual Poverty and Emptiness  
1\. \*\*Thomas Merton\*\*:   
   - \*\*Embracing Inner Emptiness\*\*: "The truly sacred attitude toward life is in no sense an escape from the sense of nothingness that assails us when we are left alone with ourselves. On the contrary, it penetrates into that darkness and that nothingness, realizing that the mercy of God has transformed our nothingness into His temple."  
   - \*\*Spiritual Poverty and True Humility\*\*: "The truly sanctified heart prays for nothing...the sanctified heart desires nothing, and contains nothing that it wishes to be freed from."  
2\. \*\*Meister Eckhart\*\*:   
   - \*\*Emptiness as Divine Fullness\*\*: “To be full of things is to be empty of God. To be empty of things is to be full of God.”  
   - \*\*Inner and Outer Man\*\*: "Every man, who loves God, only uses his outer senses so far as is absolutely necessary; he takes care that they do not drag him down to the level of the beasts, as they do some who might rather be termed beasts than men."  
<br>
### III. Acceptance of the Absurd  
1\. \*\*Albert Camus\*\*:   
   - \*\*Rejection of Traditional Consolations\*\*: "The absurd man thus catches sight of a burning and frigid, transparent and limited universe in which nothing is possible but everything is given, and beyond which all is collapse and nothingness. He can then decide to accept such a universe and draw from it his strength, his refusal to hope, and the unyielding evidence of a life without consolation."  
   - \*\*Suicide and Acceptance\*\*: "Suicide, like the leap, is acceptance at its extreme. Everything is over and man returns to his essential history."  
2\. \*\*Emil Cioran\*\*:   
   - \*\*Madness as Ultimate Realization\*\*: "The premonition of madness—Cioran describes 'ego-death' which is always said to be one of the most, if not the most, important parts of an experience of the Other, in exactly the same way as Eckhart, John of the Cross, Augustine, Luther, etc., but then goes on to describe the Nihilistic experience, which is the religious experience, as 'madness'."
