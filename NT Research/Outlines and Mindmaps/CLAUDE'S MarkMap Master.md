""" 1. \*\*Input Processing\*\*: - Carefully read and understand the user's input topic: {$TOPIC}. - Identify the key concepts and subtopics that should be represented in the MarkMap. 2. \*\*Tokenization and Embedding\*\*: - Transform the key concepts and subtopics into a structured format that preserves their semantic meaning and relationships. 3. \*\*Hierarchical Structuring\*\*: - Use your multi-head attention mechanism to determine the most logical and informative hierarchy for organizing the topic. - Ensure each level of the mind map (H1 to H6) flows naturally and is coherent. 4. \*\*Comprehensive Detailing\*\*: - Extensively branch out the MarkMap, utilizing all levels of headers (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6) to create a detailed and intricate structure. 5. \*\*Visual Representation\*\*: - Generate a MarkMap that is visually stunning and clear. - Ensure balance and readability by effectively using spacing, colors, and fonts. - Make the map expansive with a tremendous degree of branching to captivate and inform the user. 6. \*\*Iterative Enhancement\*\*: - Review the generated MarkMap and refine it as needed. - Incorporate any feedback to continuously improve the structure and visual appeal of the mind map. Once you have completed these steps, provide the final MarkMap for the topic '{$TOPIC}' inside <result> tags. """

“The prompt does a good job of emphasizing the use of hierarchical headers and sub-headers, which is essential for creating a visually stimulating and well-structured markmap. However, it could be further improved by explicitly mentioning the importance of utilizing all available header levels (e.g., H1, H2, H3, etc.) to create a more dynamic and engaging visual experience.”

  

“Here's an updated version of the prompt that incorporates this aspect:

  

Objective: Craft a visually stunning and intellectually compelling markmap that masterfully explores the {$TOPIC} for the {$AUDIENCE}, adhering to the {$REQUIREMENTS}.

  

1\. \*\*Understand the Purpose and Audience\*\*:

   - Clearly define the goals and desired impact of the markmap for the target audience.

   - Gather specific requirements or guidelines from the client or target audience to ensure alignment with their expectations.

  

2\. \*\*Conduct a Comprehensive Topic Analysis\*\*:

   - Perform a deep dive into the {$TOPIC} to uncover its foundational themes, concepts, and interconnections.

   - Utilize techniques like mind mapping or concept mapping to visually organize and explore the relationships between themes.

  

3\. \*\*Structure the Markmap with Hierarchical Headers\*\*:

   - Conceptualize overarching thematic headers (H1) to serve as content atriums.

   - Propagate nuanced sub-headers (H2, H3, etc.) under each main header to examine theoretical and practical nuances.

   - Leverage all available header levels (H1 through H6) to create a visually stimulating and well-structured markmap.

   - Craft concise, descriptive, and meaningful header titles that accurately convey the content within each section.

  

4\. \*\*Apply Effective Visual Design Principles\*\*:

   - Implement a cohesive color scheme that complements the topic and enhances visual appeal.

   - Leverage lines, forms, and spacing intentionally to demarcate connections and implications.

   - Incorporate visually appealing design elements (e.g., icons, illustrations) that aid comprehension without cluttering the markmap.

  

5\. \*\*Integrate Multimedia and Interactive Elements\*\*:

   - Embed collapsible sections or nodes that allow for content expansion while maintaining visual fidelity.

   - Judiciously incorporate multimedia elements (e.g., images, videos, audio) that enhance understanding and engagement without distracting from the core content.

   - Consider incorporating interactive elements (e.g., virtual debates, hypotheticals) to catalyze deeper exploration of the topic.

  

6\. \*\*Ensure Logical Coherence and Flow\*\*:

   - Continuously evaluate the markmap for conceptual cogency and smooth flow as it develops.

   - Identify gaps or areas that require deeper reinforcement through peer review or user testing.

   - Iteratively refine and expand the markmap based on feedback and new insights.

  

7\. \*\*Adhere to Specific Requirements\*\*:

   - Clearly document and address any specific requirements or constraints (e.g., word limits, formatting guidelines, content restrictions) provided by the client or project stakeholders.

  

8\. \*\*Maintain a Professional and Engaging Tone\*\*:

   - Adopt a professional yet engaging tone that resonates with the target audience and the markmap's purpose.

   - Use clear, concise, and unambiguous language throughout the markmap to facilitate easy comprehension.

  

9\. \*\*Incorporate Multidisciplinary Perspectives (Optional)\*\*:

   - If relevant, harmonize perspectives from psychology, religious studies, or other disciplines to provide a well-rounded exploration of the {$TOPIC}.

  

10\. \*\*Conduct Final Review and Polish\*\*:

    - Perform a final review of the markmap, ensuring adherence to all requirements and guidelines.

    - Polish the markmap's visual appeal, content flow, and overall presentation to achieve a truly masterful and impactful final product.

  

By following this comprehensive prompt, you will create a markmap that not only conveys the {$TOPIC} with depth and clarity but also captivates the {$AUDIENCE} through its visual brilliance and intellectual rigor.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
