# Nihilism: Expanded Framework

  

- Traditional Nihilism

  

  - Absence of Intrinsic Meaning, Value, and Purpose

  

    - Existential Nihilism

  

      - Traditional nihilism posits the belief in the absence of intrinsic meaning, value, and purpose in life.

  

      - This framework allows for personal interpretations of spirituality and moral frameworks while acknowledging the existential void, or the lack of objectivity, associated with traditional nihilistic beliefs.

  

    - Epistemological Nihilism

  

      - Epistemological Nihilism: This aspect focuses on skepticism towards knowledge and claims about truth, asserting that knowledge may be impossible to attain or inherently unreliable.

  

      - Skepticism towards Knowledge Claims: Epistemological nihilists question whether it's possible for humans to truly know anything with certainty, including basic facts about reality and the nature of existence.

  

    - Ethical Nihilism

  

      - Nihiltheism: Expanded Framework

  

        - Justifications

  

        - Infinite Gap

  

        - Heal or Destroy

  

##The Unbridgeable Finite/Infinite Gap

  

- Symbolism and Ultimate Concern- Can Dissolution of Subjective Justifications

  

        - Absence of Inherent Meaning: The central tenet of nihiltheism which posits that there is no predetermined or universal significance to human existence or the universe as a whole.

  

        - Non-Movement (Can be mistaken for pacifism)

  

        - Dissolution of Subjective Justifications: The rejection of subjective reasoning and justification for ethical beliefs, emphasizing the lack of objective foundation for moral systems within nihiltheistic thought.

  

- Confronting the Void: Embracing solitude and the transformative power of confronting nothingness, leading to a state fundamentally at odds with societal norms.

  

- The Paradox of Subjective Meaning: Exploring the human tendency to attach significance in a universe that is objectively meaningless, illustrating the futility of human activities against the backdrop of cosmic time.

  

- The Inevitability of Nihilism: Recognizing nihilism as an ever-present reality beneath the surface of existence, challenging individuals to authentically engage with this reality without leading to despair.

  

- The Role of Silence and Renunciation: Suggesting that true encounters with Nihilism may necessitate silent acknowledgment and renunciation, distinguishing between experiencing nothing and renouncing everything.

  

- Affirmative Aspects of Nihilism: Investigating whether there is something affirmative within the experience of nihilism that can transcend worldly suffering, referencing the mystic Cioran's idea of the "affirmative substance" of nothing.

  

- The Need for a New Language: Proposing the development of a language or philosophy rooted in the direct experience of nihilism, aiming to bridge the gap between atheistic and theistic perspectives and transcend ordinary experiences.

  

- Re-defining 'Religious' Experience: Suggesting a shift from traditional religious interpretations to a focus on transcendence and the relentless inquiry into the nature of being, challenging pre-packaged answers and embracing the mystery of existence.

###Polytheism

  

    - Pantheism

  

  - Traditional Assumption: Purpose

  

    - Teleological Arguments

  

      - Traditional assumption in theism is the concept of purpose, which suggests that there is a specific reason or intention behind the creation and existence of the universe.

  

      - Teleological arguments are philosophical arguments that attempt to prove the existence of God based on perceived evidence of design or purpose in nature.
