\###### “Why does evolution, as we ascend the ladder of life, foster instead of diminishing the capacity for useless mental anguish, for long, dull torment, bitter grief?” – Underhill  
\###### “One simply lacks any reason for convincing oneself that there is a true world.” – Nietzsche  
\###### “How is such an experience possible if the ultimate is that which transcends all possible experience?” – Tillich  
\###### “It grasps the mind with terrifying and fascinating power. It breaks into the ordinary reality, shakes it and drives it beyond itself in an ecstatic way.” – Tillich  
\###### “It is the emotion of a creature, submerged and overwhelmed by its own nothingness in contrast to that which is supreme above all creatures.” – Otto  
\###### “The initial revelation of any monastery: everything is nothing. Thus begin all mysticisms. It is less than one step from nothing to God, for God is the positive expression of nothingness.” – Cioran

\##### Complete Union with Infinite Nothingness

\###### How is Nihilism with its Transcendental interpretation distinguished from Naturalism?  
\###### Are there characteristics of Nihilism that separate it from, and go beyond, Naturalism?  
\##### The Psychedelic Journey  
\###### The psychedelic journey, properly prepared for, can open up the abyss of existence in a way that no words, thoughts, systems, or religions can prepare one for.  
\###### “The mescalin experience is a confrontation with the Other, with Transcendent Nihilism, requiring only a few grams of psilocybin to disrupt one’s worldview irreconcilably.”  
\##### Mystical Experiences  
\###### “Mescalin opens up the way of Mary, but shuts the door on that of Martha. It gives access to contemplation incompatible with action and the will to action.” – Huxley  
\###### “To confront, there must be a dissolution of the 'I' or of the ego; this is what psylocibin does with utter ease. There must be renunciation. The Other demands that we renounce.” – Suzuki  
\##### The Path of Renunciation  
\###### “One encounters Nothingness in the Transcendent experience of Nihilism.”  
\###### “Therewith, they learn that It is the Cause of all things and yet Itself is nothing, because It super-essentially transcends them all.” – Pseudo-Dionysius  
\###### “In statements such as Eckhart's, God is equated with nothing.” – Huxley  
\###### “This, however, is the sublime melancholy of our lot that every You must become an It in our world.” – Buber  
\##### Confronting the Infinite  
\###### When is one truly ready to confront something Infinite, something wholly Other?  
\###### This is not a 'meeting' with another object within the world, but a confrontation with Existence itself in the fullest sense.  
\###### “The infinite depth repels and horrifies me; the infinite height attracts and satisfies me.” – Tolstoy  
\##### The Role of Music  
\###### Music, with its abstract nature, is suited best for such a journey.  
  
\## The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing  
\### The Vague, Subtle, yet Persistent Echo  
\#### The Enigmatic Resonance of Nothingness  
\##### “There is a nagging suspicion that the diagnostics are exploiting Heidegger's exotic language in order to “keep talking,” and thus keep calm and unaffected by the horror of the bottomless abyssus humanae conscientiae with which they are incessantly confronted.” – Tønnessen  
\##### “Martin Heidegger is what happens when one believes in one’s own emotions, i.e., poetry.” – Heisman  
\##### “I know that I must either find a way to move beyond the theistic patterns of the past in search for a new way to speak of and to engage the ultimate reality that I call God, or be honest about living in a godless world.” – Spong  
\### Confronting the Abyss  
\#### The Dilemma of Authentic Engagement  
\##### Is it possible to authentically engage with the Other without self-serving motives, using a language of Nihilism that navigates the world's emptiness and a transcendental meaninglessness?  
\##### Can our minds, desperate for meaning, truly reconcile with the vast and terrifying void of meaninglessness?  
\#### The Role of Symbolic Logic  
\##### Philosophical inquiry stands at a crossroads amidst these contradictions.  
\##### We grapple with the role of symbolic logic in our conceptualization of God and our understanding of Nihilism.  
\#### Existential Resilience  
\##### Could we embody an existential resilience that surpasses historical and cultural constraints, thus confronting the void with newfound fortitude?  
\### The Language of Nihilism  
\#### Developing a Language  
\##### I propose "Nihiltheism" as a term to encapsulate this genre of human experience.  
\##### This language must remain self-critical and open to reinterpretation, not confined to myth, empirical evidence, or perceived completeness.  
\##### Heidegger's ontology in "Being and Time" provides a scaffold for this language, with concepts like anxiety, vision, and authenticity framing the human condition.  
\#### Confronting the Void  
\##### The philosophical endeavor is not to dispel the void but to understand its place in our existence.  
\##### This understanding is not a surrender but a recognition that the pursuit of knowledge and meaning, even in the face of Nothing, is an essential aspect of the human condition.  
\#### Affirmative Substance  
\##### “The initial revelation of any monastery: everything is nothing. Thus begin all mysticisms. It is less than one step from nothing to God, for God is the positive expression of nothingness.” – Cioran  
\##### A language that speaks of Nihilism must not shy away from its transcendental quest but embrace it as a genuine confrontation with the Other.  
\#### The Role of Quietism and Solitude  
\##### Quietism suggests a retreat into silence as the most sincere response.  
\##### Yet, the confrontation with Nihilism demands more than silent resignation.  
\##### While some who encounter Nihilism lack the endurance to forsake the world fully, the concept of suicide in Nihilistic thought is not an act of termination but a metaphorical pause, a contemplation of existence.
