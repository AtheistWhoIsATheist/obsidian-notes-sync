# Outline of Nihiltheism.

## Part One: The Dialectic of Transcendent Despair

### Introduction

The Nihiltheist's experience is marked by the existential horror of self-aware existence in a Nihilistic world. This extended exploration synthesizes the nightmarish realization with the ineffable resonance with the unknown, forming the Dialectic of Transcendent Despair.

  

**1. /# \*\*The Nightmare of Self-Aware Existence\*\*:** \- The core of the Nihiltheist's experience is the overwhelming realization of self-aware existence, characterized by:  

   a. \*\***Dissolution of Subjective and Objective Qualities\*\***: 

Both subjective justifications and objective, intrinsic qualities of moral values dissolve. This dissolution leaves one adrift, confronting an existential void where all conventional beliefs, values, and identities unravel.

The once solid foundation upon which they built their understanding of the world crumbles, leaving them in a state of profound uncertainty.

   b. \*\***Existential Void\*\***: 

The Nihiltheist is plunged into a disorienting existential void, challenging the very core of human existence. The absence of an intrinsic moral compass creates a baffling, all-encompassing epiphany, leaving one grappling with the very essence of what it means to be human, as the totality of their being is called into question.

   c. \*\***Dread-Filled Realization\*\***: 

The visceral quality of this nightmarish realization leads to existential despair and confusion. It's an overwhelming experience that reduces both the world and oneself to Nothingness.

d. The Dialectic of Transcendent Despair captures the existential horror of self-aware existence, emphasizing the dissolution of both subjective justifications and objective qualities of meaning, values, and purpose. This complex philosophical tapestry reflects a core piece of Nihiltheism and invites a profound exploration of existence.

  

# \# Part Two

2. \*\*Paradox of Nothingness and the Ineffable Resonance\*\*:

a. The paradox lies in the simultaneous emptiness and fullness of Nothingness that the Worldly experience of Nihilism reveals. While devoid of conventional meaning, this stage bears the seed of transcendence, a paradox that is non-rational rather than irrational. It aligns with a state of being rather than becoming.

b. \*\*Awakening to an Unaffirmable Urge\*\*: A realization of an inexplicable inclination, or perhaps a mirage, arising within the existential void. A suggestion of something beyond nihilistic reality without affirming or denying its objective existence.

c. \*\*Lingering Suspicion of the Ungraspable\*\*: A vague, subtle, yet persistent suspicion that neither asserts nor refutes but lingers in ambiguity, defying purely naturalistic understanding.

d. \*\*Symbolic Omnipotence as an Impetus\*\*: A compelling yet non-affirming urge to explore, to listen, without assuming a connection or truth. An intellectual curiosity that seeks without expecting to find.

d. \*\*Escalating Renunciation of the Finite\*\*: The Nihiltheist becomes consumed by the notion of the infinite without asserting its existence. The finite loses all value, and the Nihiltheist’s thoughts are captured by the unaffirmable infinite, even recognizing the potential futility of this pursuit.

  

# \# Part Three

3. /# **Awakening Through Nihilism** : The Possibility of New Language of Nihilism:

a. \*\*Non-Transferable Experience & Emergence into Contemplation\*\*: The unique experience of Nihilism acts as a personal guide and profound teacher, unlocking isolated philosophical introspection, escalating renunciation of the finite world, and drawing focus toward the infinite.

b. \*\*Nihilism as the Teacher\*\*: Insights and ideas are neither influenced by others nor owned individually. Instead, they arise directly from the experience of Nihilism itself, akin to Plato’s Theory of Recollection, where knowledge is recollected from a timeless realm. This understanding also kindles an interest in exploring the existence or lack thereof of the Infinite or Transcendent.

c. \*\*Interconnection & Driven Exploration\*\*: Through philosophical contemplation, the Nihiltheist discerns parallels in the narratives of religions, mystics, and psychedelic experiences, reflecting symbolic similarities. This recognition fuels an experimental quest, engaging with diverse practices, seeking access to the reported Transcendent realm.

d. \*\*Continuous Struggle & Transcendent Similarity\*\*: The dual nature of human existence introduces tension between the worldly and the Transcendent. The journey becomes a perpetual oscillation, driven by the curiosity to explore and the pull of worldly concerns. The experience of Nihilism, being the teacher, shapes the unfolding realization of Transcendent similarity.
