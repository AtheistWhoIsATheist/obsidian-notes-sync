# **Nihiltheism: A Working Definition**

**Wednesday, June 5, 2024 [[lex]], [[definition]]**

* * *

Nihiltheism is a philosophical perspective that explores the confluence of Nihilism—the recognition of a fundamentally meaningless and value-empty world—with the search for Transcendence and spiritual authenticity. It acknowledges the pervasive Nothingness inherent in existence, while paradoxically engaging with this Nothingness as a pathway to a deeper, potentially mystical reality.

The philosophy does not reject the intrinsic Absurdities and irrationalities of the human condition but rather invites a confrontation with these existential elements as a canvas for profound contemplative engagement. Nihiltheists seek to manifest a form of Understanding that straddles both Naturalism and Transcendence, leveraging intellectual rigor alongside experiential practices such as meditation or psychedelic exploration that might induce mystical states.

At its core, Nihiltheism emphasizes non-dogmatic, symbolic interpretations of Transcendental experiences, advocating for perpetual self-critical reflection that remains open to re-interpretation. It prescribes not definitive "answers," but rather a commitment to live authentically within the terror and beauty of embracing Nothing as a potential vessel of the divine or mysterious "Other."

\*\*Nihiltheism: A Definition\*\*

  

Nihiltheism is a philosophical perspective that combines the acknowledgement of existential Nihilism—the recognition of a fundamentally meaningless and value-empty world—with a dedicated pursuit of Transcendental experiences and spiritual authenticity. Central to Nihiltheism is the profound confrontation with the Nothingness of the world, viewing human existence as deeply paradoxical, caught between finite distractions and the potential for Infinite understanding.

  

This philosophy underscores the importance of embracing existential despair not as something to avoid but as a critical opening to deeper insight. It encourages continuous, self-critical engagement and symbolic interpretation, fostering an authentic life that remains attentive to both the Absurd and the potential for profound spiritual revelation.
