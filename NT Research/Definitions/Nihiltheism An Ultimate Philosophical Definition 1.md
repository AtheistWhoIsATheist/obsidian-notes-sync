**Nihiltheism** is a profound philosophical doctrine that intricately weaves traditional nihilism with the concept of transcendence, positing that the essential Nothingness inherent in existence may embody a transcendent or divine aspect—potentially 'God'. This philosophy transcends mere intellectual abstraction, demanding an immersive, visceral encounter where one's perceived reality disintegrates into an abyssal void, precipitating a profound existential crisis. The limitations of a purely naturalistic framework in comprehending this immersive experience of Nothingness underscore the necessity for a broader, more encompassing philosophical inquiry.

  

At the heart of Nihiltheism lies the recognition that confronting the collapse of one's existential foundation leaves individuals in a state of paralyzing doubt, a hollow shell of their former selves. Nihiltheism advocates for an active engagement with this worldly Nothingness through ascetic practices, utilizing this confrontation as a potent reminder of the Transcendent and promoting the renunciation of worldly attachments.

  

Rooted in a rich tapestry of philosophical and religious traditions, Nihiltheism draws profound connections with existentialist thinkers such as Soren Kierkegaard and Martin Heidegger, Christian mystics like Meister Eckhart and Miguel de Molinos, and Eastern philosophies including Buddhism, Vedanta, and Taoism—all of which embrace a form of Nothingness within human existence. Even seemingly divergent figures like Emil Cioran and Paul Tillich find common ground through the lens of Nihiltheism, highlighting its universal applicability across diverse intellectual landscapes.

  

Contrary to philosophies that offer escape from existential despair, Nihiltheism advocates for immersion within it while acknowledging the impossibility of sustaining such a state indefinitely. This perspective aligns with insights from William James’s concept of the “divided-self,” Kierkegaard’s “double-mindedness,” Heidegger’s notion of “always falling,” Plato’s critique of the human body as a hindrance to accessing eternal Forms, Vivekananda’s struggle with ego relinquishment, and even Christianity's concept of "original sin."

  

Nihiltheism portrays the experience of confronting Nothingness as annihilatory in nature—dissolving meaning, value, purpose, and subjectivity into absurdity. This all-encompassing realization fosters a deep state of anguish and leaves behind echoes urging exploration beyond the confines of purely naturalistic interpretations.

  

Nihiltheists regard entheogenic substances as conduits revealing an incorporeal realm embodying Nothingness akin to mystical traditions—a “Full” or "Plentiful" Void described vividly in terrifyingly beautiful terms. These experiences challenge the boundaries of naturalistic worldviews, inviting contemplation of the divine and the transcendent.

Post-transcendence experiences often retreat back into mundane realities, resonating with Plato’s Theory of Recollection (eternal forms), creating states reminiscent of purgatory—oscillating between subjective illusion and the quest for objective truth. This dynamic breeds an existential purgatory, a battleground between subjective illusion and the quest for objective truth.

  

Existing in the world for the Nihiltheist involves a constant reminder of life's fleeting nature and the physical world's insignificance. Morality is perceived uniquely in Nihiltheism, adopting a stance of "non-movement". In practice, this perspective may resemble pacifism or the Taoist philosophy of non-engagement with the world, often described as "doing nothing."

  

However, in the extreme interpretation of moral values being considered nonexistent, Nihiltheism takes this moral inaction to its utmost extent. The Nihiltheist does no harm, not to “do good” or “avoid evil”, but as a step in the renunciation of the physical world.

  

Nihiltheism views any attempt to "move past" Nihilism as a desperate evasion of a fundamental existential reality. Instead, it advocates for the pursuit of, participation with, and renunciation of the Nothingness of the world. It warns against the illusion of finding or creating meaning within the meaningless, suggesting that such attempts only deepen our delusions and fortify an inauthentic state of being. This perspective echoes Plato's insight that philosophy should be a preparation for one's inevitable death, transforming the apparent negation of Nihilism into a resonant affirmation of the complexity, mystery, and wonder of existence.

  

In its essence, Nihiltheism becomes a paradoxical guide to enlightenment, finding profound truth in the heart of emptiness. It challenges the reader to confront the void, to embrace the existential and philosophical questions it raises, and to find within this confrontation a deeper sense of meaning and purpose. 

  

Through this journey, Nihiltheism transforms the apparent negation of existence into a resonant affirmation of the complexity, mystery, and wonder of being, offering a profound engagement with the mysteries of existence that transcends the limitations of both naturalistic and religious frameworks.
