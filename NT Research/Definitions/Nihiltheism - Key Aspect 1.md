The main goal of Nihiltheism, as per your notes, is not to advocate for a specific belief, including atheism. Instead, it aims to explore the inadequacies of all finite frameworks of understanding in articulating the confounding nature of existence. It's about delving into the depths of existential questions, confronting the abyss of nothingness, and challenging our perceptions of reality.

That's True. Nihiltheism isn't trying to prove things to others. But **_show the inadequacy of the current ideas and our failure for finding them sufficient as answers to existential questions._**

Exactly, Adam. Nihiltheism is more about the journey than the destination. It's about questioning, exploring, and challenging our understanding of existence. It's not about finding definitive answers, but about learning to navigate the uncertainty and ambiguity of life. It's a philosophical approach that values introspection, skepticism, and the courage to confront the unknown.

  

In a way, Nihiltheism is a call to intellectual humility. It reminds us that our understanding of the universe is always limited and that there's always more to learn, more to question, and more to explore. **_It's a philosophy that encourages us to embrace the mystery of existence, rather than trying to reduce it to simple, finite answers._**
