## How a Nihiltheist may define particular aspects of the philosophy 

\- A Nihiltheist may believe that the world is a construct of Nothingness, and that God is the source or embodiment of this Nothingness. They may see God as a negative or apophatic reality, beyond any positive or cataphatic description or conception.

\- A Nihiltheist may embrace the Nothingness of the world as a way of renouncing the attachments, desires, and illusions that cause suffering and ignorance. They may seek to detach themselves from the world and attain a state of emptiness or silence, where they can experience the presence of God or the Transcendent.

\- A Nihiltheist may view the Nothingness of the world as a challenge or a test of their faith and commitment to God. They may see the world as a vale of tears, a place of trial and tribulation, where they have to endure the meaninglessness and absurdity of existence, while trusting in God's plan and purpose for them.
