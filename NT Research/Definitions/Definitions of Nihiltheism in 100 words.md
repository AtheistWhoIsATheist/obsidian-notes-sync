# 1. 

Nihiltheism is a philosophical framework that embraces the essential Nothingness of existence as a potential embodiment of the Transcendent or Divine. It connects with existential, mystical, and Eastern philosophies, promoting immersion in existential despair and the renunciation of worldly attachments. Nihiltheism values psychedelic experiences for their ability to dissolve the ego and reveal the Void. It adopts a stance of moral non-movement, recognizing the illusory nature of conventional reality, and posits the Universal Resonance of Nihilistic Experience (URNE), suggesting that existential dread is a fundamental and universal human condition.
