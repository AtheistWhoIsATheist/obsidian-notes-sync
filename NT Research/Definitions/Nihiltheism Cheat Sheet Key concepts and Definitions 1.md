# Nihiltheism: Key Concepts and Definitions

1. **Nihiltheism**: A philosophical and phenomenological framework that explores the existential vacuum of Nihilism across two distinct dimensions: the worldly experiences of meaninglessness and a Transcendent reality often encountered through altered states induced by entheogens.

    - **Worldly Experience of Nihilism**: This is the experiential realization of the complete lack of objective meaning and value within existence. And in their absence, as human actions are based on values that do not exist, this reduces all human action to absurdity. Nihiltheism grapples with this profound realization of 'Nothingness'. This results in an irresolvable doubt and existential despair, yet 'pushes' one for an explanation for such an all encompassing experience beyond a purely naturalistic framework.
    - **Transcendent Experience of Nihilism**: An experience that opens up a perspective of a seemingly non-natural, timeless, Infinite realm of existence, where one loses their sense of self (ego-death), and the "you" is gone, yet there is 'something that remains, opening up the possibility of an encounter with an 'Infinite Presence', that most would refer to as 'God'. This Transcendent experience is perceived as affirming the insights that come from the Nothingness of the world by the Infinite Nothingness. No moral judgment, no Human concerns, no good, no bad, just the Ground of Being, which is paradoxically perceived as both an encounter with a distinct Being, and also a total and complete oneness or union. This encounter with the Transcendent is often described as a radical shift in perspective, a profound existential shock that shakes the foundation of one's understanding of reality. It is not a mere intellectual understanding, but a deeply personal, direct experience that transcends the boundaries of ordinary consciousness. This is the crux of the Nihiltheist's journey: to experience the Transcendent, to directly encounter the Infinite, and to grapple with the profound implications of this experience.
        - While the experience of the Transcendent is profound and transformative, it is also deeply paradoxical and beyond human comprehension. The encounter with the Infinite Presence is driven by finite motives any more, one must let go, surrender, after one is launched into a voyage through timeless, Infinite Void that lies at the core of our existence. There, in the midst of the Void, one encounters and feels a complete union with the Ground of Being, the source of all existence. This encounter is a meeting with a separate, external 'Being', and also a suggestion of one's own inner Divinity, a realization of one's own inherent connection with the Infinite. The experience is terrifyingly beautiful, unimaginable, and otherworldly, yet one is reminded of Plato’s Theory of Recollection, as the perception of familiarity or returning 'home' is prominent.

2. **Nihilism**: Rooted in Latin ‘nihil,’ meaning ‘nothing,’ nihilism is a philosophy that rejects or questions the existence of objective meaning, purpose, or truth in life. The belief in the meaninglessness or lack of inherent value in existence. Nihiltheism acknowledges this perspective but seeks to actively engage with it, rather than avoid it.
3. Theism: Theism, in contrast, is the belief in one or more deities. It posits a universe influenced or governed by divine beings, and often comes with a set of moral and existential beliefs derived from this divine authority. Theism forms the foundation of major world religions like Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism.
4. **Transcendent Reality**: A reality that transcends our conventional understanding of existence, often encountered in altered states of consciousness induced by entheogens.
5. **Entheogens**: Psychoactive substances that induce alterations in perception, mood, consciousness, cognition, or behavior for the purposes of engendering spiritual development or otherwise cultivating transcendent experiences.
6. **Philosophical Asceticism**: An active engagement with the Nothingness in our physical world, as a "reminder” of the Transcendent, and the process of renunciation of the world.
7. **Double-mindedness**: A concept from Soren Kierkegaard that refers to the tension between our worldly experiences and the Transcendent reality.
8. **Divided-self**: A concept from William James that refers to the conflict between our worldly self and our spiritual self.
9. **Non-movement**: A unique stance on morality in Nihiltheism that could in theory, be perceived similar to Taoism's "not doing" or a strong version of pacifism, where moral inaction is taken to its utmost extent as a step in the renunciation of the physical world.
10. **Renunciation of the World**: A key tenet of Nihiltheism, this refers to the active disengagement from finite, worldly attachments and the pursuit of Transcendent reality.
11. **Simple Salvation:** This refers to the sort of bare minimum that people do to 'work towards' the Infinite. This is the finite, human religions, their languages, their rituals, that instead of pulling them towards the Infinite, instead pull them away, down into the finite world.
12. **Inherent Limitations**: Nihiltheism acknowledges the human inability to fully transcend Nihilism or to maintain a state of Transcendent reality for extended periods.
13. **Fleeting Glimpses of the Transcendent**: Nihiltheism suggests that while we cannot fully transcend Nihilism, we can experience brief moments of connection with the Transcendent, often through the use of entheogens.
14. **Illusory Nature of Existence**: Nihiltheism posits that our conventional understanding of reality is illusory, and that true enlightenment comes from recognizing and engaging with this illusion.
15. **Existential Despair**: Rather than avoiding the despair that can come with recognizing the meaninglessness of existence, Nihiltheism encourages us to deeply feel and experience it.
16. **Full Nothingness/Emptiness/Void**: Terms used to describe the experience of the Transcendent or Divine in Nihiltheism, often encountered in states of altered consciousness.
17. **Ego Dissolution**: A state often induced by entheogens where one's sense of self is dramatically reduced or completely eliminated, aligning with Nihiltheism's key tenets.
18. **Oneness with Everything**: A state of consciousness where one feels a sense of unity or interconnectedness with all things, often induced by entheogens and aligning with Nihiltheism's views.
19. **Inauthentic Life**: A life lived in denial of Nihilism, or in the pursuit of meaning in the meaningless, is viewed as inauthentic in Nihiltheism.
20. **Mystical Traditions**: Nihiltheism draws from a wide range of mystical traditions, including Christian mysticism, Buddhism, Vedanta, and Taoism, which all accept or embrace a “Nothingness” to human existence in some way.
21. **Limitations of Language**: Nihiltheism acknowledges that language, as a human construct, is inherently limited in its ability to fully capture or express the Transcendent reality and must be used and interpreted in a symbolic way. This is a common theme in many philosophical and mystical traditions.
22. **Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism**: This refers to the deceptive nature of our everyday reality, which can lead us to mistakenly attribute meaning or value to inherently meaningless phenomena. Nihiltheism encourages us to see through this illusion.
23. **Meaning Attribution**: The human tendency to assign meaning or purpose to life events, even when such meaning may not objectively exist. Nihiltheism views this as a form of self-deception that distracts us from the existential vacuum.
24. **The Absurd**: A concept borrowed from existentialism, referring to the conflict between our desire for meaning and the inherent meaninglessness of the universe. Nihiltheism embraces this concept and encourages us to confront it directly..yl **Paradox of Existence**: Nihiltheism recognizes the paradoxical nature of existence - that while life is inherently meaningless, we continue to seek meaning and purpose. This paradox is central to the philosophy. That human consciousness is the whole of our experience and we do not know what or how it exists.
