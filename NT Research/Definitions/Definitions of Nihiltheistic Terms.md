Nihiltheism: Why?

- Developing a philosophical framework that seeks to reconcile the experience of Nihilism and the possibility of the Transcendent, I.e. a concept of God, proposing a new understanding of divinity that embraces the inherent meaninglessness of existence while acknowledging the human desire for purpose and transcendence.
- Creating a Nihilistic theology that explores the idea of a God who exists outside of traditional concepts of meaning and purpose, challenging believers to embrace the inherent uncertainty and absurdity of both their subjectivity and Divine existence.
- Writing a Nihilistic manifesto that deconstructs traditional notions of God and religion, advocating for a radical rejection of the search for meaning and purpose in favor of embracing the inherent meaninglessness of existence.

## Nihiltheism: Key Concepts and Definitions


- **\*\*Nihilism\*\***: Rooted in Latin ‘nihil,’ meaning ‘nothing,’ nihilism is a philosophy that rejects or questions the existence of objective meaning, purpose, or truth in life. The belief in the meaninglessness or lack of inherent value in existence. Nihiltheism acknowledges this perspective but seeks to actively engage with it, rather than avoid it.
- **\*\*Theism\*\***: Theism, in contrast, is the belief in one or more deities. It posits a universe influenced or governed by divine beings, and often comes with a set of moral and existential beliefs derived from this divine authority. Theism forms the foundation of major world religions like Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism.
- **\*\*Nihiltheism\*\***: A philosophical and phenomenological framework that explores the existential vacuum of Nihilism across two distinct, yet directly connected redimensions: the worldly experiences of Nihilism (meaninglessness) and a Transcendent experience of Nihilism (mystical experiences), a reality often encountered through altered states induced by entheogens, meditation ,and deep introspective contemplation.[Quotes314\_analysis.txt.docx (615 kB)](Files/Quotes314_analysis.txt.docx) 
    - **\*\*Worldly Experience of Nihilism\*\***: This is the experiential realization of the complete lack of objective meaning and value within existence. And in their absence, as human actions are based on values that do not exist, this reduces all human action to a paralyzing absurdity. Nihiltheism grapples with this profound realization of 'Nothingness'. This results in an irresolvable doubt and existential despair, yet 'pushes' one for an explanation for such an all encompassing experience beyond a purely naturalistic framework.
        - "\*\*Spiritual Undertow\*\*" refers to the enigmatic whisper, the subtle, vague, yet consistent intuition, stemming from the abyss of Nihilism that leaves one questioning the nature of reality. It's an inexplicable pull towards the unknown, a catalyst for deeper exploration beyond the confines of naturalism, spurred by the collapse of worldly significance. This term encapsulates the profound disorientation and existential curiosity that follows the encounter with Nothingness, marking the start of a journey into the non-natural.
    - **\*\*Transcendent Experience of Nihilism\*\***: An experience that opens up a perspective of a seemingly non-natural, timeless, Infinite realm of existence, where one loses their sense of self (ego-death), and the "you" is gone, yet there is a 'something' that remains, opening up the possibility of an encounter with an 'Infinite Presence', that most would likely refer to as 'God'. This Transcendent experience is perceived as affirming the insights that come from the Nothingness of the world by the Infinite Nothingness. No moral judgment, no Human concerns, no good, no bad, just the Ground of Being, which is paradoxically perceived as both an encounter with a distinct Being, and also a total and complete oneness or union. This encounter with the Transcendent is often described as a radical shift in perspective, a profound existential shock that shakes the foundation of one's understanding of reality. It is not a mere intellectual understanding, but a deeply personal, direct experience that transcends the boundaries of ordinary consciousness. This is the crux of the Nihiltheist's journey: to experience the Transcendent, to directly encounter the Infinite, and to grapple with the profound implications of this experience.
        - While the experience of the Transcendent is profound and transformative, it is also deeply paradoxical and beyond human comprehension. The encounter with the Infinite Presence cannot be driven by finite motives. After one is launched into a voyage through a timeless, Infinite Void that lies at the core of our existence, one must let go, surrender.  There, in the midst of the Void, one encounters and perceives a complete union with the Ground of Being, the source of all existence. This encounter is simultaneously both a meeting with a separate, external 'Being', and also a complete union with the Infinite Presence, suggesting a sense of one's own inner Divinity, a realization of one's own inherent connection with the Infinite. The experience is terrifyingly beautiful, unimaginable, and otherworldly, yet produces the thought of "I feel like I've been here before." Reminiscent of Plato’s Theory of Recollection, where before being dropped into this physical, material existence, there is a sense of "returning home" to the Eternal Self that is prominent.
            - \- **\*\*Fleeting Glimpses of the Transcendent\*\***: Nihiltheism suggests that while we cannot fully transcend Nihilism, we can experience brief moments of connection with the Transcendent, often through the use of entheogens.

### **Defining Characteristics of the Transcendent Experience of Nihilism**

- **\*\*Beyond Naturalism\*\*:** Driven by the **Spiritual Undertow**
    - Nihilism's engagement with Transcendence challenges the limitations of naturalism, suggesting an encounter with an incorporeal realm that defies naturalistic explanations.
- **\*\*Paradoxical Nature\*\***: Nihiltheism is presented as a paradox, merging the experience of meaninglessness (Nihilism) with a spiritual pursuit (Theism), suggesting a tension between the recognition of nothingness and the search for transcendence.
- \*\*Transpersonal Experience\*\*: This state is described as a union with an indescribable Oneness, a becoming that transcends the individual and embraces cosmic unity.
- \*\*Dissolution of the Ego\*\*:Through contemplation and possibly the use of entheogens like psilocybin, one seeks to transcend the ego, entering a state of pure consciousness.
- \*\*Absence of the Self\*\*: Ultimately, the realization emerges that the self, or the experiencer, was never truly present, challenging the notion of individual …identity. This realization is often accompanied by a sense of liberation, as the constraints and limitations of the ego are shed.
- **\*\*Encounter with Infinite Presence/Nothingness\*\***: The philosophy involves a direct, experiential realization of nothingness, which dissolves subjective constructions of meaning and value, pushing one beyond traditional explanations.
- **\*\*Confrontation with the ‘Terrifyingly-Beautiful’\*\***: The journey involves facing the most profound aspects of existence, both horrifying and beautiful, revealing the groundlessness of being
- **\*\*Rejection of Traditional Belief Systems\*\***: It negates both atheistic materialism and theistic dogma, implying a stance that is neither fully aligned with disbelief nor with conventional religious faith.
- **\*\*The Universality of Nihilistic Experience\*\*:**
    - Nihilism's existential dread and perception of meaninglessness is a common theme across time periods, cultures, geographic location, and religious/philosophical background, hinting at its foundational nature in human consciousness.
- **\*\*Transcendence and Immanence\*\*:**
    - Nihilism involves a dynamic interplay between transcendence (encountering the wholly Other) and immanence (the persistent experience of worldly nihilism).
- **\*\*Non-Movement and Quietism\*\*:**
    - Nihilism's “non-movement” is reflected in a pacifist and non-engaged approach to the world, akin to Taoist philosophy, as a step towards renouncing the physical world.  “Non-movement” is a result of the experiential realization of the complete lack of all values within existence.  
        - Claim: Values are the driving force for all human movement, e.g. (Manifestation) 
        - Premise 1 (Value): I am hungry, I don’t want to starve and die, I would like to live.
        - Premise 2 (Movement): I will get up and get food.  
        - Premise 3: Theological status of values, and everything a human does is reduced to absurdity.  It allows all actions to be both ‘true’ and ‘false’ at the exact same time, in the exact same context.  If everything is both true and false at the same time and situation, then that makes EVERYTHING true, and EVERYTHING false.  Human existence is turned into complete nonsense.

- **\*\*Nihiltheism as a New Language\*\*:**
    - The proposed term "Nihiltheism" aims to create a language that transcends traditional religious and atheistic paradigms, encompassing the complexities of the nihilistic experience.
- **\*\*Skepticism and Self-Criticism\*\*:**
    - The acknowledgment of skepticism and self-criticism within the exploration of nihilism highlights the ongoing quest for understanding and the avoidance of definitive conclusions.
- **\*\*The Paradox of Pursuit\*\*:**
    - Nihilism's exploration emphasizes the paradox of seeking meaning in a meaningless world, acknowledging that this pursuit may deepen our illusions and hinder genuine insight.
- **\*\*The Need for Phenomenological Analysis\*\*:**
    - The suggestion of synthesizing phenomenological literature related to nihilism underscores the need for a comprehensive analysis of subjective experiences within this realm.
- **\*\*Transcendence and Vedanta\*\*:**
    - Nihilism's existential emptiness can be seen as a mirroring of the higher, unified state of consciousness described in Vedanta, with the journey from nihilism to Brahman representing a metaphysical progression.
    - These ideas from the source material add nuance and depth to the concepts discussed in the original passage, enriching our understanding of nihilism and its multifaceted implications.

- **\*\*Transcendent Reality\*\***: A reality that transcends our conventional understanding of existence, often encountered in altered states of consciousness induced by entheogens.
- **\*\*Entheogens\*\***: Psychoactive substances that induce alterations in perception, mood, consciousness, cognition, or behavior for the purposes of engendering spiritual development or otherwise cultivating transcendent experiences.
- **\*\*Philosophical Asceticism\*\***: An active engagement with the Nothingness in our physical world, as a "reminder” of the Transcendent, and the process of renunciation of the world.
- **\*\*Double-mindedness\*\***: A concept from Soren Kierkegaard that refers to the tension between our worldly experiences and the Transcendent reality.
- **\*\*Divided-self\*\***: A concept from William James that refers to the conflict between our worldly self and our spiritual self.
- **\*\*Renunciation of the World\*\***: A key tenet of Nihiltheism, this refers to the active disengagement from finite, worldly attachments and the pursuit of Transcendent reality.
- **\*\*_Simple Salvation_\*\*:** This refers to the sort of bare minimum that people do to 'work towards' the Infinite. This is the finite, human religions, their languages, their rituals, that instead of elevating them towards the Infinite, instead drag them away, down into the finite world.
- **\*\*Inherent Limitations\*\***: Nihiltheism acknowledges the human inability to fully transcend Nihilism or to maintain a state of Transcendent reality for extended periods.
- **\*\*Illusory Nature of Existence\*\***: Nihiltheism posits that our conventional understanding of reality is illusory, and that true enlightenment comes from recognizing and engaging with this illusion.
- **\*\*Existential Despair\*\***: Rather than avoiding the despair that can come with recognizing the meaninglessness of existence, Nihiltheism encourages us to deeply feel and experience it.
- **\*\*Full Nothingness/Emptiness/Void\*\***: Terms used to describe the experience of the Transcendent or Divine in Nihiltheism, often encountered in states of altered consciousness.
- **\*\*Oneness with Everything\*\***: A state of consciousness where one feels a sense of unity or interconnectedness with all things, often induced by entheogens and aligning with Nihiltheism's views.
- **\*\*Authentic/Inauthentic Life\*\***: A life lived in denial of Nihilism, or in the pursuit of meaning in the meaningless, is viewed as inauthentic in Nihiltheism. Yet 'Authenticity' is seemingly not possible, as we are in this nightmare of a self aware existence with no way of distinguishing right from wrong, or up from down, in any non pragmatic, arbitrary way. 
- **\*\*Mystical Traditions\*\***: Nihiltheism draws from a wide range of mystical traditions, including Christian mysticism, Buddhism, Vedanta, and Taoism, which all accept or embrace a “Nothingness” to human existence in some way.
- **\*\*Limitations of Language\*\***: Nihiltheism acknowledges that language, as a human construct, is inherently limited in its ability to fully capture or express the Transcendent reality and must be used and interpreted in a symbolic way. This is a common theme in many philosophical and mystical traditions.
- **\*\*Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism\*\***: This refers to the _Eternal Optimism,_ or deceptive nature, of our everyday mindset concerning reality, which can lead us to mistakenly attribute meaning or value to inherently meaningless phenomena. Nihiltheism encourages us to see through this illusion.
- **\*\*Meaning Attribution\*\***: The human tendency to assign meaning or purpose to life events, even when such meaning may not objectively exist. Nihiltheism views this as a form of self-deception that distracts us from the existential vacuum.
- **\*\*Paradox of Existence\*\***: Nihiltheism recognizes the paradoxical nature of existence - that while life is inherently meaningless, we continue to seek meaning and purpose. This paradox is central to the philosophy. That human consciousness is the whole of our experience and we do not know what or how it exists.
- **\*\*The Absurd Perspective\*\*:**  This is the experiential realization of the complete lack of meaning and value in life.  This is the dissolvement of one’s subjectivity and any means it once had of justifying existential concepts such as meaning, value, and purpose.

### (Bing’s Revision: 

"""  
\*\*Transcendent Experience of Nihilism\*\*: This is a profound encounter with an 'Infinite Presence' often referred to as 'God'. It's a journey into a timeless, non-natural realm where one's ego dissolves, leaving a sense of 'something' that transcends ordinary consciousness. This experience affirms the insights derived from the world's Nothingness by the distinct encounter, and simultaneous union, with the Infinite Nothingness. There's nothing to be perceived that reflects a moral judgment or human concern.  Instead, there is a direct, deeply personal experience of a resounding humility that shakes one's understanding of reality.  
  
The experience is transformative yet paradoxical, beyond human comprehension. It involves a voyage into an Infinite Void, the core of our existence, where one must surrender. Amidst the Void, one perceives a complete union with the Ground of Being, the source of all existence. This encounter, that is at the same time a oneness with, suggests a sense of inner Divinity, a realization of one's inherent connection with the Infinite. It's terrifyingly beautiful, unimaginable, and otherworldly.  And yet, beyond comprehension as the entire experience is, there's a suspicious intuition of "I feel like I've been here before", evoking a sense of "returning home" to the Eternal Self. One is reminded of Plato’s Theory of Recollection and the Eternal Forms, where it is said by Plato that we have spent an “eternity” before we were born into physical form.

  
\*\*Implications and Impact\*\*: The transcendent experience of nihilism has profound implications for one’s worldview and self-understanding. It challenges conventional notions of reality, identity, and meaning, prompting a radical reevaluation of one’s beliefs and values. This transformative experience can lead to significant personal growth and a deeper understanding of existence. However, it also poses challenges, as it requires navigating the tension between the recognition of nothingness and the yearning for transcendence.  
  
\*\*Conclusion\*\*: The transcendent experience of nihilism represents a profound encounter with the Infinite Nothingness, leading to a transformative realization of one’s inherent connection with the cosmos. It’s a journey that challenges and transcends conventional understandings of reality, offering a glimpse into the profound mystery of existence. Despite its paradoxical and challenging nature, it holds the potential for deep personal transformation and insight into the nature of reality.
