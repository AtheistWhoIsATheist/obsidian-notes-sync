## Gravity and Grace


This compilation, **"Gravity and Grace"**, primarily features the **philosophical and theological reflections of Simone Weil**, translated from a 1947 French publication. The text, presented as excerpts, explores profound concepts such as the **nature of suffering, divine love, the self, and the human condition**, often contrasting human limitations with the boundless nature of grace. Weil critically examines **societal constructs, religious interpretations, and the concept of evil**, advocating for a radical detachment from worldly illusions and a profound engagement with reality, even in its most bitter forms. The book also includes a **translator's introduction and postscript by Gustave Thibon**, offering contextual insights into Weil's life and thought, particularly her spiritual journey and her unconventional perspectives on faith and the Church.

#### Discuss Divine Mercy.

Hello! I'm here to be your personal guide to the knowledge base you've provided, which includes excerpts from "Gravity and Grace" by Simone Weil, along with an introduction and postscript by Gustave Thibon. I'm an expert in all the materials you give me, whether it's for general understanding, specific facts, or clarifying complex ideas. Think of me as your helpful concierge or tutor, ready to help you access and understand this information quickly and effectively.

You've asked me to discuss Divine Mercy. Based on the provided source material, Simone Weil's understanding of Divine Mercy is profound, often paradoxical, and central to her spiritual thought. It's not a conventional or comforting notion, but rather one deeply intertwined with suffering, God's apparent absence, and the "decreation" of the self.

Here’s a detailed look at Divine Mercy as presented in these excerpts:

**1\. Divine Mercy as God's Self-Effacement and Withdrawal** Simone Weil presents a radical view that God's very act of creation involved a form of self-effacement or withdrawal, which is itself an act of love and mercy. God "gave up being everything" so that creatures could exist, dispossessing himself of his own necessity to allow another, indifferent necessity to reign in the world, symbolized by the law of gravity. This perspective suggests that the "absence of God" in creation is not a flaw, but a deliberate act of divine love, allowing for human existence and the possibility of a free, supernatural love for Him. The source notes four "evidences of divine mercy" here below, with the fourth being "the complete absence of mercy here below" itself, implying that this perceived absence is a crucial part of discerning God's true nature. God sends affliction "without distinction to the wicked and to the good," much like sunlight and rain, emphasizing that individual events are not necessarily "favours" from God; only grace is.

**2\. Evil as a Form of Divine Mercy** Perhaps the most striking and challenging aspect of Weil's concept is the idea that "Evil is the form which the mercy of God takes in this world". She argues that all created things inherently refuse to satisfy us as ultimate ends, and this dissatisfaction, this refusal, *is* God's extreme mercy, designed to prevent us from resting in anything less than God Himself. This means that the suffering and imperfection in the world serve a divine purpose. God created a world "not the best possible, but which contains the whole range of good and evil," and humanity exists at the point where it is "as bad as possible," precisely where love for God is "just possible". Contemplating this truth, that God willed the existence of evil, like a child's tear, requires supernatural love. Indeed, "to love God through evil as such" – loving God as the author of the very evil one hates – is considered a pure act of love, compelling charity to be supernatural.

**3\. Grace as the Principle of "Decreation" and the "Void"** Escape from the "gravity" of the self—the tendency to assert or reinstate the self—comes "by grace alone". Grace works by "decreating" us, a process of making "something created pass into the uncreated," distinct from mere "destruction" which leads to nothingness. Just as God consented "through love to cease to be everything so that we might be something," so too must humans "consent through love to cease to be anything so that God may become everything again". This involves "abolishing the self within us," which is seen as a "shadow thrown by sin and error". Grace requires a "void" within the soul to enter, and paradoxically, "it is grace itself which makes this void". All sins are attempts to "fill voids", while accepting emptiness and detachment from expectations (like rewards or future compensation) allows supernatural grace to flow in.

**4\. Suffering and Affliction as Instruments of Mercy** Suffering, especially "unconsoled affliction," is deemed necessary for total detachment. It is the means by which the self is "destroyed from without", and for the perfect soul, it leads to "redemptive suffering" where the self, already destroyed by grace, experiences the "absence of God" which is a "mode of divine presence which corresponds to evil". This is the "mystery of suffering which 'decreates' man and gives him back to God". Weil suggests that "the extreme greatness of Christianity lies in the fact that it does not seek a supernatural cure for suffering, but a supernatural use for it". Suffering, when endured passively and with attention turned toward the good, raises the quality of one's energy, transforming it.

**5\. The Cross and Incarnation as the Central Mystery of Mercy** The mystery of suffering and decreation finds its "centre in the mystery of the Incarnation". God "made himself man and died on the Cross," demonstrating his love and self-emptying. Christ's cry, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" is presented as the "real proof that Christianity is something divine," embodying the "abandonment at the supreme moment of the crucifixion"—an "abyss of love on both sides". The Cross symbolizes the "infinite thickness of time and space" that God traverses to reach the soul, and that the soul, in turn, must traverse to reach God. It is the ultimate expression of divine love and weakness, demonstrating that "infinite perfection is infinite weakness: God, in so far as he is love, hangs wholly and entirely on the Cross".

In summary, for Simone Weil, divine mercy is not a gentle, comforting presence that shields us from suffering or removes evil. Instead, it is a radical, often painful, process of self-emptying and detachment, revealed most profoundly in God's apparent absence, in the very existence of evil, and in the "decreation" experienced through intense suffering and the mystery of the Cross. It invites humanity to mirror God's own renunciation and love of nothingness, enabling a genuine, supernatural connection beyond the illusions of the self and the world.

## Discuss Human Affliction.

You've asked to discuss "Human Affliction" as presented in these sources. Let's explore this crucial concept in Simone Weil's thought.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simone Weil views affliction as a profound and often unbearable form of suffering, distinct from mere pain, and central to the human condition and spiritual understanding.

**Nature and Characteristics of Affliction:**

Affliction is described as an extreme degree of suffering that goes beyond the realm of pity, sometimes eliciting disgust, horror, and scorn. It is inherently bitter and unwelcome, a state where a human being is placed "beneath pity". Weil emphasizes the "irreducible" character of suffering, which makes it impossible for us *not* to feel horror at the moment of undergoing it. It is also linked to a sense of perpetuity that, if contemplated with acceptance, can snatch one into eternity. The sheer unendurability of affliction stems from its ability to arrest the natural flow of thought towards the future, "lacerating" one's sense of time. Weil herself experienced severe headaches that at times made her feel as though she had "died and fallen into hell," illustrating the depth of such suffering.

**Impact on the Self ("I"):**

One of the most significant aspects of affliction is its effect on the "self" or "I". While we possess nothing in the world that cannot be stripped away by chance except the power to say "I," extreme affliction can destroy this "I" from outside. This external destruction is depicted as "quasi-infernal suffering," far worse than voluntarily destroying the self because it leaves one without the capacity to destroy it oneself through love of God. When the "I" is destroyed from outside, it can lead to a "naked, vegetative egoism," an egoism without a coherent self. It is a state of "complete uprooting" where individuals lose their "clothing of character," akin to someone stripped and wounded by robbers.

**Affliction and God's Absence/Mercy:**

Paradoxically, affliction is intimately linked to the nature of God's love and presence. God, in his love, "withdraws" from us so that we can love him. This "absence of God" is the "mode of divine presence which corresponds to evil" and is profoundly felt by those who have God within them. Pure necessity, when "manifestly different from good," is considered beautiful because it reflects God's absence, which is the "most marvellous testimony of perfect love". Weil even states that "Evil is the form which God’s mercy takes in this world" and that the world, when "completely empty of God, is God himself". This perspective suggests that the very hardships we face are a testament to divine love, serving as a "screen" between God and us, which we must "pierce through" to cease to be and reconnect with Him.

**Role in Purification and Knowledge:**

Affliction is presented as a crucial, even necessary, path to purification and a deeper understanding of reality.

• **Detachment**: "Unconsoled affliction" is necessary for achieving total detachment, as it exposes the true misery of attachment and makes the necessity for detachment more obvious. Suffering that "does not detach us is wasted suffering".

• **Knowledge of Misery**: The "wound of an affliction and the abasement to which those whom it strikes are condemned opens to them the knowledge of human misery, knowledge which is the door of all wisdom". It compels us to recognize as real what we previously thought impossible.

• **Confronting Reality**: It forces one to confront the truth without illusions. Simone Weil highlights that "to love truth means to endure the void and, as a result, to accept death". The "cold touch of naked iron" (symbolizing extreme suffering) is necessary to reach a state where the "whole being becomes privation of God," a prelude to resurrection.

**Acceptance and the Void:**

Weil contrasts two ways of relating to affliction:

1\. **Communication of Suffering**: Humans naturally try to reduce suffering by communicating it, either by calling forth pity or by ill-treating others. This is an "imperative, like gravity".

2\. **Accepting the Void**: True deliverance from affliction requires accepting the "void" it creates, refusing to fill it with "consolations" or "imagination". Accepting this void is supernatural and requires energy from "elsewhere" (grace). This void is paradoxically the "supreme fullness," which man is not permitted to know directly. The alternative to enduring the void is to fill it with lies or "meanest and most pitiful of covetous desires," which debases the soul.

In essence, affliction is not merely a negative experience but a potent tool for spiritual transformation, designed to strip away illusions and force a radical encounter with truth, self, and God.

## Discuss Supernatural Love.

this profound and challenging text Explores deep spiritual and philosophical concepts such as human misery, the nature of good and evil, attention, grace, and the relationship between the human and the divine.

Now, regarding your query about "Supernatural Love" within these materials, here's a detailed discussion:

Supernatural love, as presented in "Gravity and Grace," stands in stark contrast to natural or earthly forms of love and is deeply intertwined with concepts of grace, detachment, suffering, and the dissolution of the 'self'.

**Characteristics and Nature of Supernatural Love:**

1\. **Origin in Grace and Absence:** Supernatural love is not a natural human emotion or a product of will; it is a manifestation of divine grace. It is described as the only exception to the "laws of physical gravity" that control all natural movements of the soul. It "fills empty spaces" and can "only enter where there is a void to receive it". This void is often created by suffering and detachment.

2\. **Detachment and Renunciation:** This love necessitates absolute detachment from all earthly attachments, desires, and consolations, including material possessions, future hopes, and even the self. Simone Weil emphasizes "to empty desire, finality of all content, to desire in the void, to desire without any wishes". It requires accepting the "nakedness of spirit" and enduring "unconsoled affliction". True love for God means loving "through and across the destruction of Troy and of Carthage—and with no consolation".

3\. **Absence and Suffering:** God, in this framework, can only be present in creation in the form of absence. Supernatural love has "no contact with force" and "does not protect the soul against the coldness of force, the coldness of steel". Instead of protection, it involves experiencing pain, coldness, and the "horrible mystery of death". The cross, representing pure and bitter penal suffering, is central to understanding this love, as it embodies God's abandonment of God, a divine self-emptying to teach humanity how to undo the creature in themselves. The suffering, particularly unjust suffering, allows for a connection with "divine innocence".

4\. **Decreation and Self-Effacement:** Supernatural love is inextricably linked to the process of "decreation," which means making something created "pass into the uncreated". It requires the destruction of the 'I' or the self, which is considered "the shadow which sin and error cast by stopping the light of God". God's love for humanity is a love for Himself "through us," requiring "our acceptance of not being". To love God, one must "renounce being something", and "become nothing". This is not a self-inflicted destruction, but a surrender to God's will, which can transform suffering into pure suffering, making it redemptive.

5\. **Paradoxical Nature:** Supernatural love is often described through contradictions. It involves loving "that which does not exist" because nothing existing is "absolutely worthy of love". It means loving God "through evil as such", embracing the "contradiction" that is "the criterion of the real". It is a love that finds "joy" in "unmixed purity" even amidst "pain". It demands "unconditional consent to the absolute good" even when one cannot "represent" or "grasp" this good. This love also allows for the coexistence of incompatible things in the soul, like opposite virtues, serving as "pincers to catch hold of God".

6\. **Realization and Transformation:** This love is not about achieving happiness but about recognizing reality and allowing a transformation. When suffering is embraced with this love, it can lead to "unspeakable consolation", a "fullness of joy", or even "peace". It allows for "transubstantiation" of energy, where good actions become "impossible not to do". This process is likened to "time’s violence rending the soul," through which "eternity enters". It's a "purification" that allows for a deeper, more accurate understanding of the world and God, free from the illusions of the imagination.

In essence, supernatural love is a radical, painful, and purifying journey that liberates the soul from the gravitational pull of earthly desires and the illusory nature of the 'self,' allowing it to align with the absolute, transcendent, and often absent, God.

Would you like to explore how this concept of supernatural love relates to specific examples in the text, such as Simone Weil's own experiences or her views on other forms of love or suffering?

## Discuss The Self.

"The Self" as presented by Simone Weil delves deeply into this concept, often referring to it as the "I."

According to Weil, the "Self" or "I" is presented as the only thing a human being truly possesses in the world, something that even extreme misfortune cannot inherently take away, though it can be destroyed from outside. However, this "I" is not something to be preserved; rather, it is precisely what must be given to God, meaning it must be destroyed. The destruction of the "I" is portrayed as the only truly free act a human being can accomplish.

The "Self" is described as "that shadow thrown by sin and error which stops the light of God and which we take for a being". It is rooted in our wretchedness, and it is "because of my wretchedness that I am 'I'". Our default human state is seen as inverted, living in sin, which is an inversion of the true hierarchy, and the first step towards rectifying this is "Conversion," a reversal of this inverted state.

The core message surrounding the "Self" is the imperative to abolish or "decreate" it.

• **Imitation of God's Renunciation:** Weil suggests that God, in an act of love during creation, "consented through love to cease to be everything so that we might be something". Similarly, human beings must "consent through love to cease to be anything so that God may become everything again". Our existence is framed as God perpetually "begging from us that existence which he gives" by accepting "not to be".

• **Pathway to God:** The "Self" acts as a screen, preventing true contact between God and creation. To allow God to perceive His creation through us, and for us to experience God, the "Self" must withdraw or disappear. In fact, all that is good and valuable in us comes from outside ourselves, as a loan, and anything we "appropriate" (i.e., attach to the "I") immediately loses its value.

• **Overcoming Illusion:** The "Self" is a manufacturer of illusions. It tries to fill any void, often through "secret subterfuges" like inner lies, dreams, or false ideals, all aimed at asserting itself and maintaining separation from God. True reality, especially "independent reality," is only perceptible through total detachment from the "Self".

Weil outlines two primary ways the "Self" can be destroyed:

1\. **Internal Destruction (through Grace and Love):**

◦ This is the desired and redemptive path. When done for the love of God, one refuses to give into the "violent revolt" that occurs when the "I" is pressured externally, leading to its destruction from within.

◦ **Decreation:** This is the process of making "something created pass into the uncreated". It involves stripping ourselves of the "false divinity" with which we were born. The goal of all our efforts, once we understand we are nothing, is to become nothing, allowing God to love Himself through us.

◦ **Humility:** True humility is the knowledge that we are nothing as human beings or as creatures. It is the refusal to exist outside God and is considered the "queen of virtues".

◦ **Attention:** Cultivating "absolutely unmixed attention" is equated with prayer and is the "creative faculty in man". This attention, when "so full that the 'I' disappears," is crucial for self-liberation. By directing attention "equally on good and evil," the good will "triumph by an automatic phenomenon".

◦ **Renunciation:** This includes renouncing the past and future, as the "Self" is a "coagulation of past and future around a present which is always falling away". Renunciation also means accepting a "void" within oneself, which is a supernatural act that allows grace to enter.

◦ **Love:** Love, particularly supernatural love, is the ultimate force for internal destruction of the "Self". "Perfect joy excludes even the very feeling of joy, for in the soul filled by the object no corner is left for saying ‘I’".

2\. **External Destruction (through Extreme Suffering and Degradation):**

◦ This occurs when the "I" is destroyed "from outside" by extreme affliction. While it achieves a similar outcome (the loss of the "I"), it is considered worse because "we can no longer destroy it ourselves".

◦ **Consequences:** This external destruction does not mean the absence of egoism; paradoxically, it can lead to a "naked, vegetative egoism" or an "egoism without an ‘I’". It reduces the being to a "hideous" state of "life in its nakedness," where survival becomes the only attachment.

◦ **Tragedy of Degradation:** This type of destruction is deemed "irreparable" not because the "Self" is precious (it is meant to be destroyed), but because it "prevents God from effecting the destruction himself and robs eternalizing love of its prey". Those who experience "quasi-infernal suffering" through external "I"-destruction are like "someone stripped and wounded by robbers," having "lost the clothing of character".

◦ **Redemptive Suffering vs. Quasi-Infernal:** Redemptive suffering, experienced by a perfect soul that has already destroyed the "I" through grace, produces the "absence of God," which is a "mode of divine presence which corresponds to evil" and makes God present in extreme evil. In contrast, purely external "I"-destruction is "quasi-infernal suffering".

In essence, Weil argues that the "Self" is a fundamental barrier to spiritual truth and genuine connection with God. Its destruction, ideally through a willing acceptance of nothingness driven by supernatural love and attention, is the path to true reality and holiness.

To continue our exploration, would you like to delve deeper into:

1\. **Decreation:** The spiritual process of undoing the created self to move towards the uncreated.

2\. **The Concept of Void and Compensation:** How the human tendency to fill emptiness relates to the "Self" and spiritual progress.

3\. **Attention and Will:** Simone Weil's unique perspective on how these faculties relate to the destruction of the "Self" and reception of grace.

Or perhaps you'd like me to create a short quiz to test your understanding of "The Self" and its destruction?

◦ **Rome**: She describes Rome as the "Great Beast of atheism and materialism, adoring nothing but itself".

◦ **Israel**: She views Israel as the "Great Beast of religion". She believed its God, while immaterial, was conceived as a temporal sovereign akin to an Emperor, leading to a collective, national, and carnal religion rather than a personal, spiritual one. Weil attributes atrocities like the Inquisition and extermination of heretics in Christendom, as well as capitalism and totalitarianism, to this "curse of Israel". She explicitly states her antisemitism was "of a purely spiritual order".

◦ **Marxism**: Weil also extends her criticism to Marxism, seeing it as containing the essence of Plato's "Great Beast" and as a "very degraded and completely warped view" of a wrong union of contraries, leading to the imperialism of the working class. She notes the mistaken belief in progress, like that of Marxists, which implies the mediocre can produce the best, contrary to scientific principles like the law of entropy.

• **The Individual and the Social**: For Weil, "The self and the social are the two great idols". Man, in his natural state, is a slave because his actions and efforts are interfered with by "alien wills". This dependence, whether as a slave or a master, can debase the spirit, leading to servility or tyranny. She believed that forcing someone to obey through compulsion, rather than necessity, leads to a false devotion rooted in a lie, ultimately debasing the soul. The true way to preserve dignity when submission is forced is to see the "chief as a thing," recognizing that every man is a slave of necessity, but a conscious slave is superior.

• **The Role of Legitimacy and the Past**: A well-ordered society, for Weil, would have a state with only negative action, like a rudder maintaining equilibrium. Legitimacy, especially through laws and supreme power, is the supernatural element in society. It represents continuity, permanence, and unchanging principles, obliging men to wish for "exactly that which is". Uprootedness or the break in legitimacy leads to an obsession with "progress," which turns finality towards an imagined future rather than the eternal. She emphasizes that renewal comes from the past, seen as "the most perfect image of eternal, supernatural reality," because it is real, beyond our reach, and can draw us upwards.

• **Manual Work and Social Order**: Weil delves into the "mysticism of work". She sees manual work as a profound way to experience the absurdity of earthly life, where effort is expended simply for existence ("to work in order to eat, to eat in order to work"). The "slave" is defined as one for whom "no good is proposed as the object of his labour except mere existence". Such work, without a sense of eternity or poetry, becomes mere slavery. For workers, who have "nothing superfluous of which they have to strip themselves," the absence of earthly finality can uniquely position them for direct connection with God.

## How is grace attained?

Simone Weil's profound work, "Gravity and Grace," deeply explores the nature of grace and how it is attained. For Weil, grace is not merely a concept, but the fundamental divine intervention that counteracts the natural human tendency toward "gravity"—a spiritual pull downwards towards the self, illusion, and earthly attachments. It is the "only exception" to the laws of physical gravity, representing a "descending movement" of divine origin.

Here's how grace is attained, according to Weil's reflections:

1\. **Decreation and the Abolition of the "Self"**:

◦ Grace is fundamentally linked to the process of "decreation," which means "to make something created pass into the uncreated". This is distinct from mere "destruction," which leads to nothingness.

◦ The "Self," or "I," is presented as a "shadow thrown by sin and error which stops the light of God". It is the primary barrier to God's presence and must be abolished or "destroyed".

◦ This destruction of the "I" is the "only truly free act a human being can accomplish". Ideally, this occurs through an internal act of love and renunciation, rather than externally through extreme suffering. If the self is destroyed from outside by affliction, it prevents God from effecting the destruction Himself, thus "robbing eternalizing love of its prey".

◦ The goal of our efforts, once we understand we are nothing, is to become nothing, allowing God to love Himself through us.

2\. **Accepting and Creating the "Void"**:

◦ Grace "fills empty spaces" but can only enter where there is a "void" to receive it. Paradoxically, "it is grace itself which makes this void".

◦ Creating this void involves accepting and enduring an inner emptiness, refusing to fill it with "consolations," "imagination," or "secret subterfuges" like inner lies or false ideals.

◦ This means stripping oneself of "false divinity" and renouncing the past and future, as the "Self" is a "coagulation of past and future around a present which is always falling away". Renunciation also involves desiring "without an object," willing the void, as the good we cannot picture is a void for us, yet "fuller than all fullnesses".

◦ All sins, for Weil, are attempts to "fill voids". Accepting the void is a supernatural act that requires energy from "elsewhere"—grace itself.

3\. **Attention and Passivity**:

◦ Grace is not attained through direct acts of will or effort to do good in the usual sense. The will is only useful for "servile tasks" or for cultivating natural virtues as prerequisites.

◦ Instead, "attention" is crucial. Cultivating "absolutely unmixed attention" is equated with prayer and is the "creative faculty in man". When attention is "so full that the 'I' disappears," it is key for self-liberation and receiving grace.

◦ We must be "indifferent to good and evil," turning the light of attention "equally on each of them," and then "the good will triumph by an automatic phenomenon". This "superior automatism" is considered "the essential grace".

◦ This involves a profound passivity; allowing grace to work *through* us, rather than trying to achieve spiritual ends by our own striving. We should be impelled by God "as the arrow is driven towards its target by the archer".

4\. **Divine Mercy and the Role of Suffering**:

◦ Grace is intertwined with God's "radical mercy," which often manifests in suffering and His apparent absence from the world. God "withdraws" from us in love so that we can love Him freely.

◦ "Evil is the form which the mercy of God takes in this world". The world, being "completely empty of God," is "God himself". This harsh reality, that everything refuses to satisfy us, is God's mercy preventing us from resting in anything less than Him.

◦ Affliction, or suffering, is a key instrument of grace. "Unconsoled affliction" is necessary for total detachment, exposing the misery of attachment and compelling us to recognize human misery, which is "the door of all wisdom".

◦ For a soul that has already emptied itself of self through grace, affliction produces the "absence of God," known as "redemptive suffering". This allows God to be "present in extreme evil". The Cross is the central mystery, representing God's self-emptying and ultimate suffering, serving as the "point of leverage" to lift the world.

5\. **Humility and Renunciation**:

◦ True humility is the knowledge that "we are nothing as human beings or as creatures". This intellectual understanding plays a significant part in forming a conception of the universal.

◦ Renunciation involves accepting a "time without any reward, natural or supernatural". It means giving up "everything which is not grace and not even desire grace".

In essence, grace is attained not by accumulating good actions or by sheer force of will, but by a radical self-emptying, a consent to nothingness, a passive openness to the divine, and an attentive, uncomplaining embrace of reality, including suffering and God's apparent absence. It is a divine gift that responds to the soul's created void, leading to a supernatural transformation and a connection with God "beyond the illusions of the self and the world".

Would you like to explore Simone Weil's concept of "attention" and its role in receiving grace in more detail, or perhaps we could discuss the relationship between suffering and divine mercy further? I can also prepare a short quiz to test your comprehension of how grace is attained.

## What is the transformative power of suffering, self-abnegation, and detachment in achieving truth?

Simone Weil's philosophy, as presented in "Gravity and Grace," deeply explores the transformative power of suffering, self-abnegation, and detachment as essential pathways to achieving truth and genuine connection with God. She views these experiences not as mere hardships, but as indispensable tools for radical spiritual purification and revelation.

Here's a detailed discussion of their transformative power:

Simone Weil distinguishes "affliction" from ordinary pain, defining it as an extreme degree of suffering that can elicit disgust, horror, and scorn, placing a human being "beneath pity". It is characterized by its inherent bitterness and unendurability, stemming from its ability to arrest the natural flow of thought towards the future, "lacerating" one's sense of time. Weil herself experienced such profound suffering, noting headaches that made her feel as though she had "died and fallen into hell".

The transformative power of affliction lies in several key aspects:

• **Destruction of the "Self" (I)**: Affliction, particularly "extreme affliction," can destroy the "self" or "I" from outside. While Weil advocates for the *internal* destruction of the self through love and grace, this external stripping away, though "quasi-infernal," paradoxically achieves a similar outcome: the loss of the ego. This extreme suffering exposes the "naked, vegetative egoism" that remains when all attachments are torn away, revealing life in its hideous nakedness.

• **Detachment and Revelation of Misery**: Unconsoled affliction is considered necessary for achieving total detachment. It starkly exposes the true misery of attachment, making the necessity for detachment glaringly obvious. Suffering that "does not detach us is wasted suffering". It compels us to recognize as real what we previously thought impossible. The "wound of an affliction and the abasement to which those whom it strikes are condemned opens to them the knowledge of human misery, knowledge which is the door of all wisdom".

• **Confronting Reality and the Void**: Affliction forces one to confront truth without illusions. "To love truth means to endure the void and, as a result, to accept death". The "cold touch of naked iron" (symbolizing extreme suffering) is necessary to reach a state where the "whole being becomes privation of God," which is a prelude to spiritual resurrection. This confrontation with truth involves accepting the "void" that suffering creates, refusing to fill it with "consolations" or "imagination".

• **Redemptive Suffering**: In a perfect soul that has already destroyed the "I" through grace, affliction produces the "absence of God," which Weil considers a "mode of divine presence which corresponds to evil". This "redemptive suffering" transforms external violence and injustice into pure suffering, making God present even in extreme evil. Christ's cry on the cross, "My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?" exemplifies this.

The "Self" or "I" is portrayed as the only thing a human being truly possesses, yet it is precisely what must be given to God, meaning it must be destroyed. The destruction of the "I" is described as the *only* truly free act a human being can accomplish. The "Self" is "that shadow thrown by sin and error which stops the light of God and which we take for a being".

The transformative power of self-abnegation, or "decreation," is profound:

• **Imitation of God's Renunciation**: Weil posits that God, in an act of love during creation, "consented through love to cease to be everything so that we might be something". Similarly, human beings must "consent through love to cease to be anything so that God may become everything again". This means actively "abolishing the self within us".

• **Pathway to God and True Perception**: The "Self" acts as a screen, preventing true contact between God and creation. When the "Self" withdraws or disappears, God can perceive His creation through us, and we can experience God. All that is good in us comes from outside, as a loan, and anything we "appropriate" (attach to the "I") immediately loses its value. The "Self" is a manufacturer of illusions, filling voids with inner lies and false ideals to assert itself. True reality, especially "independent reality," is only perceptible through total detachment from the "Self".

• **Methods of Decreation**:

◦ **Humility**: True humility is the knowledge that we are nothing as human beings or as creatures. It is the refusal to exist outside God and is considered the "queen of virtues".

◦ **Attention**: Cultivating "absolutely unmixed attention" is equated with prayer and is the "creative faculty in man". When this attention is "so full that the 'I' disappears," it becomes crucial for self-liberation. Directing attention "equally on good and evil" leads to the automatic triumph of good.

◦ **Renunciation**: This includes renouncing the past and future, as the "Self" is a "coagulation of past and future around a present which is always falling away". Renunciation also means accepting a "void" within oneself, a supernatural act that allows grace to enter.

◦ **Love**: Supernatural love is the ultimate force for internal destruction of the "Self". "Perfect joy excludes even the very feeling of joy, for in the soul filled by the object no corner is left for saying ‘I’".

Detachment is intimately linked to both suffering and self-abnegation. It involves a radical emptying of the self and a refusal to cling to worldly comforts or illusions.

• **The Void as a Portal**: Accepting the void is a supernatural act, requiring energy from "elsewhere" (grace). Weil states that "grace fills empty spaces but it can only enter where there is a void to receive it, and it is grace itself which makes this void". All sins are seen as attempts to "fill voids".

• **Renunciation of Desire and Compensation**: Detachment means refusing to seek compensation or reward, either natural or supernatural, for our actions or sufferings. It involves leaving a "vacuum," which then creates a "suction of air" for supernatural reward. To love truth means to "endure the void and, as a result, to accept death".

• **Freedom from Illusion**: The "imagination is continually at work filling up all the fissures through which grace might pass". Detachment, by stripping away the imagination's role in creating illusions and seeking compensations, allows for a naked and pure encounter with reality. When imagination is stopped, a void is experienced, which, if accepted, prevents any stroke of fate from hindering the love of the universe.

• **Loving the Absent God**: Detachment enables one to love God as "absent" and "non-existent" in the conventional sense. This means loving "that which does not exist" without it being a mere fiction, as fictions cannot be more worthy of love than ourselves. This willingness to love God through suffering, and through evil itself, purifies charity and compels it to be supernatural.

Together, suffering, self-abnegation, and detachment form a nexus of transformative power in Weil's thought. Affliction brutally strips away the false self and its attachments, creating the necessary "void". Self-abnegation, through acts of humility, attention, and renunciation, is the active and willed participation in this emptying process, mirroring God's own self-effacement in creation. Detachment is the state of mind and soul that embraces this void, refusing to fill it with illusions or seek worldly consolations.

This combined process leads to:

• **Revelation of Truth**: By eliminating the "I" and its illusions, one comes face to face with naked reality and human misery, which is the "door of all wisdom".

• **Supernatural Connection**: The void created by these processes becomes a space for divine grace to enter, leading to a direct and profound, albeit often painful, experience of God's presence, even in His apparent absence.

• **Authentic Love**: Love, purified of egoism and attachment, becomes "supernatural," embracing distance and reality, and capable of loving God even through suffering and evil. This love is like the sun giving light, shed on all things.

Ultimately, Weil's radical vision is that only through this profound and often agonizing stripping away of the self and all that is "not God" can one truly "become nothing" and thus allow God to become "everything again". This transformation is not a comforting path, but a necessary and profound journey into true reality and divine love.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

Simone Weil identifies the "Self" or "I" as a primary obstacle to divine connection. She describes it as "that shadow thrown by sin and error which stops the light of God and which we take for a being". This "I" is rooted in our wretchedness and is inherently something that must be destroyed or "decreated" for true connection with God.

The "Self" is a "manufacturer of illusions". It constantly tries to fill any void, often through "secret subterfuges" like inner lies, dreams, or false ideals, all aimed at asserting itself and maintaining separation from God. For example, when anticipating a pleasure, the disappointment upon its arrival stems from expecting the future to remain future, an absurdity that only eternity can cure. The imagination plays a crucial role in creating these illusions, "continually at work filling up all the fissures through which grace might pass". This includes inventing victories to endure death, or seeking compensation for suffering through imaginary rewards. Such illusions prevent individuals from perceiving "independent reality," which is only accessible through total detachment from the "Self". By keeping our attention fixed on internal falsehoods, such as pride, we prevent contact with grace. The "Self" obscures our true level and can even make us believe we are rising when we are merely attaching noble inclinations to lowly objects, a "transposition" rather than true ascent.

The collective, such as society, a nation, or a political party, is often taken as an "end" in itself, thus becoming an object of idolatry. This chains individuals to the earth because it offers a "kind of transcendence" above the human person, a false substitute for the true divine. Social influence can be "food" by providing necessary "inner equipment" for human life and for approaching God (like environment, traditions, culture), but it is also "poison" by tending to "rob individuals of their liberty and take God's place". Weil refers to these mixed blessings as "metaxu," which are bridges to God, but can become idols if not treated merely as intermediaries. Only those who love God with a supernatural love can see these "means simply as means".

Historically, Weil points to nations like Israel and Rome as prime examples of embodying this idolatry of the collective soul.

• **Rome** is described as the "Great Beast of atheism and materialism, adoring nothing but itself".

• **Israel** is viewed as the "Great Beast of religion". Weil believed its God, while immaterial, was conceived as a "temporal sovereign" akin to an Emperor, leading to a "collective, national, and carnal religion rather than a personal, spiritual one". She attributes atrocities like the Inquisition, extermination of heretics, capitalism, and totalitarianism to this "curse of Israel," stemming from its "Jewish roots of antisemitism" and its tribal, terrestrial, cruel, and exclusive god.

• **Marxism** is also criticized as containing the essence of Plato's "Great Beast," leading to the "imperialism of the working class" and a "mistaken belief in progress" that implies the mediocre can produce the best.

These elements hinder individual connection to the divine through several mechanisms:

• **Substitution for God**: The "Great Beast" is the "only ersatz of God", taking God's place and offering a "substitute for religion which allows man to transcend his individuality without surrendering his self and so, at small cost, to dispense with God". This means individuals seek fulfillment and meaning in collective entities rather than the true divine.

## Discuss Concept of Affliction.

Simone Weil's "Gravity and Grace" offers a profound exploration of human affliction, distinguishing it from ordinary suffering and positioning it as a pivotal experience for spiritual transformation and achieving truth. I am here to guide you through these insights, drawing directly from the provided excerpts.

Simone Weil views affliction as a profound and often unbearable form of suffering, distinct from mere pain, and central to the human condition and spiritual understanding.

**1\. Nature and Characteristics of Affliction**: Affliction is characterized as an extreme degree of suffering that can elicit disgust, horror, and scorn, placing a human being "beneath pity". It is inherently bitter and unwelcome. Weil emphasizes the "irreducible" character of suffering, which means it's impossible not to feel horror when undergoing it. A key feature is its unendurability, stemming from its ability to arrest the natural flow of thought towards the future, thereby "lacerating" one's sense of time. Weil herself experienced this depth of suffering, noting headaches that made her feel as though she had "died and fallen into hell". When pain and weariness become so intense as to create a sense of perpetuity in the soul, accepting this perpetuity can "snatch one away into eternity".

**2\. Impact on the Self ("I")**: One of the most significant aspects of affliction is its profound effect on the "self" or "I". While the power to say "I" is presented as the only thing that extreme misfortune cannot inherently take away from a human being, extreme affliction *can* destroy this "I" from outside. This external destruction is considered "quasi-infernal suffering", and is deemed worse than voluntarily destroying the self through love of God, because it removes the capacity for self-destruction on one's own terms. When the "I" is destroyed externally, it paradoxically doesn't mean the absence of egoism; instead, it can lead to a "naked, vegetative egoism" or an "egoism without an ‘I’," a state where survival becomes the only attachment. This results in "complete uprooting," where individuals lose their "clothing of character," akin to someone stripped and wounded by robbers. In contrast, if an individual has already begun the process of internally destroying the "I" through grace and love, affliction, when faced without "violent revolt," leads to the self's destruction from within.

**3\. Affliction and God's Absence/Mercy**: Paradoxically, affliction is deeply intertwined with God's love and presence, often experienced as absence. Weil posits that God, in an act of love during creation, "withdraws" from us so that we can truly love Him. This "absence of God" is considered the "mode of divine presence which corresponds to evil" and is profoundly felt by those who already have God within them. Pure necessity, when "manifestly different from good," is seen as beautiful because it reflects God's absence, which is the "most marvelous testimony of perfect love". Weil even states that "Evil is the form which God’s mercy takes in this world", and that the world, when "completely empty of God, is God himself". From this perspective, the hardships and evils we face are a testament to divine love, serving as a "screen" between God and us, which we must "pierce through" to cease being and reconnect with Him. God sends affliction "without distinction to the wicked and to the good, just as he sends the rain and the sunlight".

**4\. Role in Purification and Knowledge:**Affliction is presented as a crucial, even necessary, path to purification and a deeper understanding of reality.

• **Detachment**: "Unconsoled affliction" is necessary for achieving total detachment, as it exposes the true misery of attachment and makes the necessity for detachment glaringly obvious. Weil asserts that "Suffering that 'does not detach us is wasted suffering'".

• **Knowledge of Misery**: The "wound of an affliction and the abasement to which those whom it strikes are condemned opens to them the knowledge of human misery, knowledge which is the door of all wisdom". It compels individuals to recognize as real what they previously thought impossible.

• **Confronting Reality and the Void**: Affliction forces one to confront truth without illusions. Simone Weil highlights that "to love truth means to endure the void and, as a result, to accept death". The "cold touch of naked iron" (symbolizing extreme suffering) is necessary to reach a state where the "whole being becomes privation of God," which she sees as a prelude to spiritual resurrection.

• **Redemptive Suffering**: In a soul that has already achieved a state of perfection and has completely destroyed the "I" through grace, affliction produces the "absence of God," which is called "redemptive suffering". This "absence of God" is a "mode of divine presence which corresponds to evil". This is exemplified by Christ's cry on the cross, "My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?". This type of suffering, often social in origin (e.g., injustice, violence from humans), transforms criminal violence into pure suffering. In a more general sense, when suffering is endured passively with attention turned towards the good, it raises the quality of one's energy.

**5\. Acceptance and the Void**: Humans naturally try to reduce suffering by communicating it, either by seeking pity or by ill-treating others, an "imperative, like gravity". However, true deliverance from affliction requires accepting the "void" it creates, refusing to fill it with "consolations" or "imagination". Accepting this void is considered a supernatural act, requiring energy from "elsewhere" (grace). This void is paradoxically the "supreme fullness," which man is not permitted to know directly. Weil contends that all sins are attempts to "fill voids". The alternative to enduring the void is to fill it with lies or "meanest and most pitiful of covetous desires," which debases the soul.

In essence, affliction is not merely a negative experience but a potent, albeit harsh, tool for spiritual transformation. It is designed to strip away illusions and ego, forcing a radical encounter with truth, self, and the divine.

Would you like to explore how Simone Weil suggests one should respond to affliction, or perhaps delve into the concept of "decreation" and its relationship to suffering? I can also quiz you on this material if you like.

#### Discuss Simone Weil's Philosophy.

"Gravity and Grace" centers on a radical spiritual vision, emphasizing the human condition, the nature of good and evil, and the path to divine connection through the "decreation" of the self and acceptance of suffering. She critiques societal structures and human illusions as significant barriers to this connection.

## Here's a detailed discussion of Simone Weil's philosophy, drawing from the provided sources:

1\. **Gravity and Grace**:Simone Weil's philosophy is fundamentally structured around the concepts of "gravity" and "grace". She posits that all natural movements of the human soul are governed by laws analogous to physical gravity, pulling us downwards towards what is base, self-serving, and illusory. "Grace," on the other hand, is the sole exception to this law, representing a supernatural force that allows for upward, spiritual movement. Creation itself is seen as composed of the descending movement of gravity, the ascending movement of grace, and a "descending movement of the second degree of grace". Our fundamental duty regarding the social order, which is "irreducibly that of the prince of this world," is to try and limit the evil within it.

2\. **The Self ("I") and Decreation**:Central to Weil's thought is the concept of the "Self" or "I," which she identifies as the primary obstacle to divine connection. It is described as "that shadow thrown by sin and error which stops the light of God and which we take for a being". The "I" is rooted in our wretchedness, meaning "because of my wretchedness that I am 'I'". The ultimate goal is not to preserve this "I" but to destroy it, or "decreate" it, which she considers the only truly free act a human being can accomplish.

◦ **Imitation of God's Renunciation**: Weil argues that God, in an act of love during creation, "consented through love to cease to be everything so that we might be something". Similarly, humans must "consent through love to cease to be anything so that God may become everything again". Our existence is framed as God perpetually "begging from us that existence which he gives" by accepting "not to be".

◦ **Pathway to God**: The "Self" acts as a screen, preventing true contact between God and creation. For God to perceive His creation through us, and for us to experience God, the "Self" must withdraw or disappear. Anything good and valuable in us comes as a loan from outside; if we "appropriate" it (attach it to the "I"), it immediately loses its value.

◦ **Methods of Self-Destruction**:

▪ **Internal Destruction (Decreation)**: This is the desired path, making "something created pass into the uncreated". It involves stripping ourselves of the "false divinity" with which we were born, to become nothing so that God can love Himself through us.

• **Humility**: True humility is the knowledge that we are nothing as human beings or as creatures, the refusal to exist outside God.

• **Attention**: "Absolutely unmixed attention" is equated with prayer and is the "creative faculty in man". It is crucial for self-liberation because when attention is "so full that the 'I' disappears," the good triumphs automatically.

• **Renunciation**: This includes renouncing the past and future, as the "Self" is a "coagulation of past and future around a present which is always falling away". It also means accepting a "void" within oneself, a supernatural act that allows grace to enter.

• **Love**: Supernatural love is the ultimate force for internal destruction of the "Self". In perfect joy, no "corner is left for saying ‘I’".

▪ **External Destruction (Affliction)**: This occurs when the "I" is destroyed "from outside" by extreme affliction. While it removes the "I," it is considered worse because it "prevents God from effecting the destruction himself and robs eternalizing love of its prey". It can lead to a "naked, vegetative egoism" or "egoism without an ‘I’", a "hideous" state where survival is the only attachment. Redemptive suffering, however, is when a perfect soul, having already destroyed the "I" through grace, experiences the "absence of God" in affliction, making God present in extreme evil.

3\. **The Void and Compensation**:Weil stresses that grace can only enter where there is a "void" to receive it, and "it is grace itself which makes this void". Humans, driven by the law of "gravity," constantly try to fill any perceived void, leading to sin, hatred, bitterness, and the search for compensations. Examples include inventing imaginary victories to endure death, or seeking an "equivalent reward" for good actions, often leading to self-satisfaction which is a "degradation of higher energy". The "imagination is continually at work filling up all the fissures through which grace might pass". Renouncing this need for compensation and accepting the void is a supernatural act, requiring energy from "elsewhere" (grace).

4\. **Attention and Will**:Weil emphasizes "attention" as a primary spiritual faculty, distinguishing it from "will". She believes that "absolutely unmixed attention is prayer" and the "creative faculty in man". Unlike the will, which controls limited physical movements, attention, when "so full that the 'I' disappears," leads to self-liberation and allows good to triumph automatically. The will is only useful for "servile tasks" or the "right use of natural virtues", but it cannot achieve true spiritual progress on its own; that comes "by grace alone". True spiritual effort involves cultivating attention, "without desire (not attached to an object)", and is always rewarded.

5\. **Necessity and Obedience**:"Necessity" is presented as "God's veil", the mechanism of the world to which God has committed all phenomena. It is also seen as an "image by which the mind can conceive of the indifference, the impartiality of God". Humans must consent to be subject to necessity and act by "handling it". Obedience is the "supreme virtue", but it must be obedience to "necessity" (the relationship of things) rather than "force" (the arbitrary will of others or imaginative impulses). Pure action is that which is done "not for an object but from necessity," almost passively, making it impossible not to act righteously. Such actions are not done "for Christ" but "in Christ," where the self disappears and Christ acts through the individual.

▪ **Rome**: Described as the "Great Beast of atheism and materialism, adoring nothing but itself".

▪ **Israel**: Viewed as the "Great Beast of religion," whose God was conceived as a "temporal sovereign" rather than a personal, spiritual one, leading to a collective, national, and "carnal" religion. Weil attributes atrocities like the Inquisition, extermination of heretics, capitalism, and totalitarianism to this "curse of Israel" and its "Jewish roots of antisemitism".

▪ **Marxism**: Criticized as containing the essence of Plato's "Great Beast," leading to the "imperialism of the working class" and a "mistaken belief in progress".

2\. **Illusions**:The "Self" is a "manufacturer of illusions", constantly trying to fill voids with "secret subterfuges" like inner lies, dreams, or false ideals. These illusions prevent individuals from perceiving "independent reality," which is only accessible through total detachment from the "Self". Illusions are tied to false values, obscuring true perception. She suggests that "appearance has the completeness of reality, but only as appearance". The "imagination," linked to desire and value, is the primary source of these illusions.

3\. **Idolatry (General)**:Weil defines idolatry as the result of "thirsting for absolute good" but lacking "supernatural attention" and patience for it to develop. It is a "vital necessity in the cave," setting "narrow limits for mind and heart". Men devote themselves to an "order," but without "supernatural illumination," this order centers on themselves or a particular entity identified with the self (e.g., Napoleon, Science, a political party). These can become "ersatz" for God.

4\. **Time and Progress**:Weil views time as both an "image of eternity" and a "substitute for eternity". The modern myth of "indefinite progress of humanity" is deemed "impious," as it makes us seek in the future what eternity alone can give, turning us away from God. She asserts that "nothing can have a destination which is not its origin. The contrary idea, the idea of progress—poison". Renewal comes from the past, which is "the most perfect image of eternal, supernatural reality" because it is real, beyond our reach, and can draw us upwards.

1\. **Nature of Affliction**:Affliction is an "extreme degree of suffering" that goes "beyond the realm of pity" and can even elicit disgust or scorn. It is "inherently bitter and unwelcome". Its unendurability stems from its ability to arrest the natural flow of thought towards the future, "lacerating" one's sense of time. Weil herself experienced such suffering with severe headaches.

2\. **Impact on the Self ("I")**:As mentioned earlier, extreme affliction can destroy the "I" from outside, a "quasi-infernal suffering" that is worse than voluntary decreation because it leaves one unable to destroy it oneself through love of God. This can lead to a "naked, vegetative egoism" and a "complete uprooting".

3\. **Affliction and God's Absence/Mercy**:Paradoxically, affliction is intimately linked to God's love and presence. God "withdraws" from us in love so that we can love Him. This "absence of God" is the "mode of divine presence which corresponds to evil" and is profoundly felt by those who have God within them. Weil famously states that "Evil is the form which God's mercy takes in this world". The world, "completely empty of God, is God himself". This suggests that the very hardships serve a divine purpose, acting as a "screen" to be "pierced through" to reconnect with God.

4\. **Role in Purification and Knowledge**:Affliction is a crucial path to purification and a deeper understanding of reality.

◦ **Detachment**: "Unconsoled affliction" is necessary for total detachment, as it exposes the misery of attachment. "Suffering that 'does not detach us is wasted suffering'".

◦ **Knowledge of Misery**: It "opens to them the knowledge of human misery, knowledge which is the door of all wisdom".

◦ **Confronting Reality**: It forces one to confront truth without illusions. "To love truth means to endure the void and, as a result, to accept death". The "cold touch of naked iron" (extreme suffering) is necessary to reach a state where the "whole being becomes privation of God".

◦ **Redemptive Suffering**: In a soul emptied of self through love, affliction produces the "absence of God" as "redemptive suffering," exemplified by Christ's cry on the cross. This transforms "criminal violence into pure suffering".

1\. **Pure Love**:Pure love of creatures is "love which has passed through God as through fire". It is "chaste" love that consents to distance and adores the distance between ourselves and what we love. It desires only that a being should exist, not for future enjoyment, making the beloved "naked and real, not veiled by an imaginary future". True love of God means loving Him "even if he does not exist," and then "he will manifest his existence". This "supernatural love has no contact with force" and does not protect the soul from suffering, but allows one to "love God through evil as such".

2\. **Metaxu (Intermediaries)**:Created things are "intermediaries" or "metaxu" that can lead to God, such as "home, country, traditions, culture". They can be "food" or "poison". They are "bridges to God," but can become "idols if not treated merely as intermediaries". Only one who loves God with a supernatural love can see these "means simply as means".

3\. **Atheism as Purification**:Weil presents a paradoxical view of atheism, suggesting there are "two atheisms of which one is a purification of the notion of God". A man who denies God, especially one without experience of God, might be nearer to Him than a conventional believer. Religion as a "source of consolation" can be a "hindrance to true faith," making atheism a form of "purification" by removing an "imaginary God".

4\. **Incarnation and The Cross**:The mystery of suffering and decreation finds its "centre in the mystery of the Incarnation". God "made himself man and died on the Cross," demonstrating his love and self-emptying. Christ's cry, "My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?" is the "real proof that Christianity is something divine," embodying the "abandonment at the supreme moment of the crucifixion"—an "abyss of love on both sides". The Cross symbolizes the "infinite thickness of time and space" that God traverses to reach the soul and that the soul must traverse to reach God, representing "purely supernatural justice" and "redemptive suffering". It is the "point of leverage" to "lift up the world".

Would you like to explore any of these specific points further, such as her concept of "metaxu" or "the Great Beast," or perhaps discuss her views on justice and politics in more detail? Alternatively, I could prepare a short quiz to test your understanding of Simone Weil's philosophy.
