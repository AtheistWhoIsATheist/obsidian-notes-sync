## Introduction

- The provided text discusses William Lane Craig's philosophical critique of atheism, which asserts that a world without [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) lacks ultimate meaning, value, and purpose, rendering it "absurd" and "unlivable" for human beings.

- Craig's critique is supported by "Adam's Dilemma," a personal validation from an atheist who, after grappling with the philosophical implications, found himself in a "nihilistic-atheistic world that I hate" and was forced to concede that [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c) is the logical conclusion of an atheistic worldview, but also unlivable.

- Adam, who initially identified as an "evangelical" atheist, was deeply committed to rationality and confident in his worldview, but after engaging with Craig's work, particularly the paper "[The Absurdity of Life Without God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/0bcbfb2f-2650-4cdc-b01a-572b52b61228)," he was unable to refute Craig's arguments and ultimately affirmed Craig's thesis that atheism entails nihilism.

- Adam's agreement with Craig came at a profound personal cost, as his worldview was "completely shattered," leading to deep depression, a sense of utter despair, and a reclusive lifestyle, with Adam describing himself as "an atheist who hates atheism."

## The Absurdity of Life Without God

- Craig's critique extends to various non-theistic attempts to construct meaning, value, and purpose, dismissing them as either fabricating self-delusions, "subconsciously borrowing" from theism, or "smuggling in a God-substitute," and instead presents Biblical [Christianity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) as the only coherent and "livable" alternative that provides a consistent foundation for a truly meaningful existence.

- The text highlights the "[practical impossibility of atheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/4e7b07ee-e951-4be9-a4f3-990a3d6a30c2)" through Francis Schaeffer's "two-story universe" analogy, which explains how atheists intellectually reside in the "lower story" (a finite, Godless, absurd world), but to live happily, they "continually make leaps of faith into the upper story" (where meaning, value, and purpose truly reside), despite lacking a rational basis for doing so within their worldview.

- The individual, Adam, is experiencing an existential crisis, as he wants to believe in [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) but cannot, and is struggling with the concept of rationality and the value of life in an atheistic framework, which is in line with Craig's "unhappy or inconsistent" dilemma.

- Adam's validation of Craig's critique of prominent atheists, including the "New Atheists" and "professional philosophers", has led to significant backlash from the secular community, as it undermines the perceived intellectual integrity and practical livability of non-theistic and secular humanist frameworks for meaning, value, and purpose.

- Adam's adoption of Craig's argument that secular humanist efforts to construct meaning are "inconsistent", "self-delusional", or "borrowed" from theism implies that secular attempts at finding meaning are inherently insufficient or illusory, and his personal suffering and intellectual honesty create psychological discomfort for the secular community.

- Craig's counsel to Adam involves a multi-faceted path towards Christian faith, including intellectual and literary engagement, experiential openness, and practical spiritual steps, designed to guide Adam out of his "nihilistic rut" and into a more consistent and sustainable worldview.

- Adam's situation serves as a counter-example to the desired image of atheism as a liberating worldview, validating Craig's assertion that [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c) is "unlivable", and highlighting the need for a more nuanced and honest discussion about the implications of atheism on meaning, value, and purpose.

- The exchange between Adam and Craig highlights the significance of the moral argument for God's existence and the ontology of values, which Adam believes many secular thinkers fail to comprehend, and demonstrates the importance of intellectual engagement and personal reflection in navigating the complexities of faith and worldview.

- The text discusses William Lane Craig's counsel to Adam, who is experiencing profound despair and intellectual honesty, as a means to address his existential crisis and provide a pathway out of his "nihilistic rut".

- Craig advises Adam to read C.S. Lewis's "[Surprised by Joy](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b26855bc-8bd5-486b-b206-e0479b09838c)" as a relatable narrative of intellectual and spiritual conversion from [naturalism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/e674fe07-8aae-4c03-92ea-81c56d5254fb), and to investigate the historical credibility of Jesus' resurrection as a rational basis for [Christian](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) belief.

- He also encourages Adam to seek "glimpses of a transcendent reality" through immersive music, artistic beauty, and natural wonder, and to engage in daily prayer and reading Francis Thompson's poem "The Hound of Heaven" to prepare his heart for belief in [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8).

- Additionally, Craig suggests that Adam attend a church to engage with Christians and experience their community, and addresses Adam's skepticism about the Holy Spirit by clarifying its role in providing "fundamental assurance" and convicting unbelievers of their need for forgiveness and moral cleansing.

- The text concludes that Adam's personal experience of philosophical struggle serves as a direct, personal validation of Craig's abstract philosophical arguments about the inherent absurdity and practical unlivability of atheism, and that Craig's counsel provides a structured pathway out of this existential crisis by offering Biblical Christianity as the sole consistent and livable "upper story" that provides ultimate meaning, value, and purpose.

- The text also suggests that Adam's journey and Craig's proposed solution might be related to broader discussions of "existential angst" in philosophy, and that it might align with or diverge from other philosophical or psychological approaches to overcoming such a state.

- The central thesis of [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae) posits that without the existence of God and immortality, human life is inherently "absurd," lacking ultimate meaning, value, and purpose, and that this atheistic worldview is "unlivable" for human beings because they cannot consistently and happily endure such a reality without resorting to "inconsistencies" or "self-delusion".

- Craig's argument is explained through Francis Schaeffer's "two-story universe" analogy, where atheists intellectually reside in the "lower story" but to live happily, they "continually make leaps of faith into the upper story" where meaning, value, and purpose truly reside, despite lacking a rational basis for doing so within their worldview.

## The Practical Impossibility of Atheism

- Adam, a former staunch atheist, initially attempted to refute Craig's arguments but later experienced a profound shift, admitting that Craig's paper "completely shattered my worldview" and that he could not answer Craig's objections to atheism, thus validating Craig's core thesis that [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c) is the logical conclusion of an atheistic worldview and that it is unlivable.

- Adam's personal journey serves as a powerful validation of Craig's philosophical critique, and his agreement with Craig also led him to criticize other secular figures, such as "New Atheists" and "professional philosophers", for their perceived intellectual shortcomings in addressing the implications of atheism on meaning, value, and purpose.

- Adam's validation of Craig's critique led to profound personal struggle and depression, illustrating Craig's assertion that a consistently atheistic worldview is "unlivable", and his emotional devastation aligns directly with Craig's prediction that if one lives consistently within the atheistic worldview, they will find themselves "profoundly unhappy".

- Adam's experience is described as a "shattered worldview" and "deep unhappiness", where he confessed that everything had died for him and that he had become depressed to no end, stuck in a nihilistic-atheistic world that he hated, thus providing a personal testimony to the unlivable nature of a consistently atheistic worldview.

- The personal testimony of Adam, who has become a recluse, serves as evidence for William Lane Craig's claim that nihilism is "unlivable", as Adam's struggle with existential angst and internal contradiction reflects the "unhappy or inconsistent" dilemma described by Craig.

- Adam's desire for [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) and meaning, despite his intellectual inability to believe, demonstrates the shortcomings of his atheistic worldview and the pervasive nature of his nihilistic struggle, as he questions the foundation of his intellectual pursuits and finds himself unable to answer fundamental questions about the value of life.

- Adam's experience validates Craig's abstract philosophical arguments about the "[practical impossibility of atheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/4e7b07ee-e951-4be9-a4f3-990a3d6a30c2)" and its "unlivability" when faced with its logical conclusions, providing a powerful and human dimension to Craig's critique and challenging the notion that atheism leads to a liberating or fulfilling life.

- In response to Adam's distress, Craig offers a multi-faceted path towards [Christian faith](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409), including intellectual engagement with authors like [C.S. Lewis](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/12275491-6525-440a-b190-82a2c5f71a40), historical evidence for Jesus' resurrection, experiential openness through art and nature, and practical spiritual disciplines, aiming to guide Adam out of his "nihilistic rut" and into a worldview that provides a consistent and happy framework for meaning, value, and purpose.

- Adam's personal struggle and depression serve as a poignant validation of Craig's argument that a consistently embraced atheistic worldview is "unlivable" for human beings, leading to profound unhappiness and an inescapable "nihilistic rut" unless one makes an "inconsistent" leap of faith or accepts self-delusion, highlighting the importance of considering the psychological impact of philosophical arguments on individuals and the need for a nuanced approach to philosophical debates with existential implications.

- William Lane Craig's philosophical framework suggests that human life is inherently "absurd" without the existence of God and immortality, lacking ultimate meaning, value, and purpose, and that while atheism may logically lead to these nihilistic conclusions, it is "unlivable" for human beings because they cannot consistently and happily endure such a worldview.

- Craig uses Francis Schaeffer's "two-story universe" analogy to illustrate the "practical impossibility of atheism", where atheists intellectually reside in the "lower story" but must "continually make leaps of faith into the upper story" to live happily, despite lacking a rational basis for doing so within their worldview, and these "leaps of faith" are seen as "inconsistencies" or "self-delusions".

- Adam, a self-proclaimed atheist and philosophy student, initially sought to refute Craig's paper, "[The Absurdity of Life Without God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/0bcbfb2f-2650-4cdc-b01a-572b52b61228)", but ultimately concurred with Craig's conclusions, stating that "[Nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c) is the logical conclusion of an atheistic worldview" and that he agrees with Craig's arguments regarding meaning, value, and purpose.

- The impact of Craig's arguments on Adam was profound and devastating, leading to a deeply personal struggle with nihilism, which Adam describes as being "stuck in a nihilistic-atheistic world that I hate" and has become "depressed to no end", serving as a poignant empirical confirmation of Craig's assertion that nihilism is "unlivable".

- Adam also expresses disappointment in other atheists, such as the "New Atheists" and "professional philosophers", who he feels do not understand the "moral argument" for God's existence and fail to comprehend the ontology of values, and specifically criticizes [Christopher Hitchens](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cbed9e68-0448-4afd-871e-dbc7f1bf7ef5) for claiming that atheism does not entail specific conclusions beyond mere non-belief in [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8).

- Adam's philosophical alignment with Craig is evident in his statement that he agrees with almost everything Craig says, and he even finds the "rationality of an 'abstract' notion of God" more plausible and admits that "objective moral values seem to be real" despite his atheism, reflecting Craig's points about the intuitive draw to objective values.

- Adam's experience perfectly embodies Craig's central dilemma, which states that if we try to live consistently within the atheistic worldview, we shall find ourselves profoundly unhappy, and Adam's story serves as a real-world validation of Craig's philosophical critique of atheism.

- The text discusses the idea that if individuals manage to live happily without God, it is only by contradicting their own worldview, and Adam represents the unhappy side of this dilemma, unable to reconcile his nihilistic beliefs with his desire for a meaningful life.

- Adam finds himself in a state of existential crisis, where his atheism seems intellectually true, but he does not want to live with the implications, creating a deep-seated struggle between his desire for a God and his inability to believe.

- This personal struggle supports the argument made by Craig that atheism, when consistently embraced, leads to despair and is unlivable for human beings, highlighting the need for a more fulfilling and meaningful worldview.

- In response to Adam's crisis, Craig offers a multifaceted counsel designed to guide him out of his intellectual and existential dilemma and towards [Christian faith](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409), providing a pathway for Adam to make the leaps of faith into the upper story with a rational and experiential basis in Biblical Christianity.

## Inconsistencies in Atheistic Worldviews

- Craig's counsel combines intellectual engagement, including reading the works of authors like [C.S. Lewis](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/12275491-6525-440a-b190-82a2c5f71a40), with experiential openness, aiming to provide Adam with a more comprehensive and satisfying understanding of the world and his place in it.

- [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae) advises Adam, an atheist and philosophy student, to read C.S. Lewis's "[Surprised by Joy](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b26855bc-8bd5-486b-b206-e0479b09838c)" to understand Lewis's struggle with atheism and skepticism about Christian faith, and to read the [Gospels](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/ffcff133-8520-4390-85bc-8c08ba358858) to encounter the life of [Jesus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bec8e474-a374-4420-b6a4-103ad207cf97) and his historical credibility.

- Craig suggests that Adam should look into the historical credibility of Jesus' personal claims and resurrection, noting that the majority of historical Jesus scholars, including secular ones, agree on the historicity of Jesus' resurrection, and points Adam to specific chapters in his book "Reasonable Faith" and his debates with skeptical New Testament critics.

- To help Adam "escape the cloying bonds of [naturalism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/e674fe07-8aae-4c03-92ea-81c56d5254fb)", Craig recommends seeking glimpses of a transcendent reality beyond the material world by immersing himself in classical music, appreciating artistic beauty, and experiencing natural wonder, all aimed at preparing his heart for belief in [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8).

- Craig also advises Adam to begin praying daily and to read Francis Thompson's poem "The Hound of Heaven", which portrays a persistent divine pursuit of the soul, and suggests that the person described in the poem is Adam himself.

- Craig encourages Adam to attend a church where the Gospel is faithfully preached and to get to know Christians, describing them as more reflective, compassionate, and focused on spiritual things, and clarifies the role of the Holy Spirit in providing fundamental assurance to believers and conviction to unbelievers of their need for God's forgiveness and moral cleansing.

- Adam's personal testimony serves as a validation of Craig's philosophical critique of atheism, particularly his arguments regarding life's absurdity and the practical impossibility of living consistently with a nihilistic worldview, and Craig's counsel is presented as a prescriptive pathway out of Adam's existential crisis and into a [Christian](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) worldview that provides ultimate meaning, value, and purpose.

- The text discusses the concept of [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c) in relation to atheism, citing the example of an individual named Adam, who after being exposed to the arguments of philosopher [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae), found his atheistic worldview shattered and was left feeling depressed and stuck in a nihilistic-atheistic world.

- Adam's experience serves as a validation of Craig's assertion that nihilism is a logical conclusion of an atheistic worldview and is "unlivable" for human beings, leading to an existential crisis and a desire for a world that "would make sense".

- Adam expresses disappointment in other atheists, such as the "New Atheists" and "professional philosophers", who he feels do not understand the moral argument for God's existence and fail to comprehend the ontology of values, specifically criticizing [Christopher Hitchens](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/cbed9e68-0448-4afd-871e-dbc7f1bf7ef5) for being "patently false" in his claims about atheism.

- Despite being an atheist, Adam finds himself philosophically aligned with Craig, agreeing with many of his points, including the idea that objective moral values seem to be real, and even finding the concept of an "abstract" notion of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) to be more plausible.

- Adam's dilemma embodies Craig's central argument that if one tries to live consistently within an atheistic worldview, they will find themselves profoundly unhappy, and if they manage to live happily, it is only by giving the lie to their worldview, with Adam representing the "unhappy" side of this dilemma.

- In response to Adam's struggles, Craig offers a multifaceted counsel designed to guide him out of his intellectual and existential dilemma towards [Christian faith](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409), recommending a combination of intellectual engagement, literary exploration, and experiential openness, including reading the works of [C.S. Lewis](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/12275491-6525-440a-b190-82a2c5f71a40) and engaging with the Bible.

- Craig's counsel is focused on providing a pathway for Adam to make the "leaps of faith" into the "upper story" that Craig argues atheists are already making inconsistently, but this time with a rational and experiential basis in Biblical Christianity, in an effort to help Adam find a more fulfilling and meaningful worldview.

- [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae) advises Adam to read C.S. Lewis's [Surprised by Joy](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b26855bc-8bd5-486b-b206-e0479b09838c), as he believes Adam will resonate with Lewis's struggles to overcome atheism and skepticism about Christian faith, and also suggests that Adam should read the [Gospels](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/ffcff133-8520-4390-85bc-8c08ba358858) to learn about the life of [Jesus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/bec8e474-a374-4420-b6a4-103ad207cf97) and encounter his compelling story and character.

- Craig recommends that Adam investigate the historical credibility of Jesus' personal claims and resurrection, noting that the majority of historical Jesus scholars, including secular ones, agree on the historicity of Jesus' resurrection, and points Adam to specific chapters in his book Reasonable Faith and his debates with skeptical New Testament critics.

- To help Adam experience a transcendent reality beyond the material world, Craig suggests immersing himself in classical music, appreciating artistic beauty, and experiencing natural wonder, which can prepare his heart for belief in [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), and also advises Adam to begin praying daily and to read Francis Thompson's poem "The Hound of Heaven".

- Craig encourages Adam to attend a church where the Gospel is faithfully preached, allowing him to get to know Christians who are more reflective, compassionate, and focused on spiritual things, and clarifies the role of the Holy Spirit in providing fundamental assurance to believers and conviction to unbelievers of their need for God's forgiveness and moral cleansing.

- Craig connects Adam's agreement with the moral argument to his need for forgiveness and redemption, suggesting that acknowledging objective moral duties should lead him to recognize his own moral failures and need for redemption, and presents his counsel as a prescriptive pathway out of Adam's existential crisis, offering a structured approach to transition from an atheistic worldview to a [Christian](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) one that provides ultimate meaning, value, and purpose.

- William Lane Craig argues that non-theistic attempts to create meaning and morality are ultimately inconsistent, self-delusional, or based on borrowed concepts, rendering atheism unlivable for human beings, as he illustrates through Francis Schaeffer's "two-story universe" analogy, where atheists intellectually reside in the lower story, a finite and Godless world, but make leaps of faith into the upper story to find meaning and purpose.

## The Concept of the Noble Lie

- Craig identifies inconsistencies in non-theistic attempts to construct meaning, including the ideas of [Jean-Paul Sartre](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c84a5699-366a-40bb-a34e-d818850018bb), who proposes that individuals can create meaning for their lives by freely choosing to follow a certain course of action, which Craig dismisses as utterly inconsistent and an exercise in self-delusion.

- Craig also critiques Ernst Bloch's suggestion that modern humans subconsciously borrow the belief in immortality from their ancestors to cope with death, viewing this as an inconsistency and a leap of faith for which the atheist has no rational basis within their worldview.

- Additionally, Craig argues that some thinkers, such as [Francis Crick](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/03f0b61e-fa42-4d29-a6b8-1293d45fd495), [Fred Hoyle](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b8aca536-6bf5-469c-b0b3-d0d00f3819a4), and [Carl Sagan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9fedf250-9594-472a-8b6e-a8c338e18a2f), smuggle in a God-substitute by capitalizing "Nature" or "Cosmos" or attributing personality to natural processes, which he asserts is a bizarre way of speaking and a form of smuggling in a God-substitute through the back door.

- Craig's central argument is that without [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), there can be no objective standards of right and wrong, and all things are permitted, reducing morality to expressions of personal taste, and he argues that human attempts to affirm objective values are inherently inconsistent.

- Craig critiques the moral outrage despite relativism of atheistic humanists, such as [Albert Camus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5aa7f182-29a0-42e6-8225-0c5e138f3558), [Bertrand Russell](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/4778111e-00e4-4561-8a04-94bc6613f195), [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/373f531e-23bc-470c-9ea7-cb2e7cf5d82e), and Jean-Paul Sartre, who affirm traditional values like human love and brotherhood, which Craig argues is logically incompatible with a worldview where all things are permitted.

- Craig asserts that atheistic humanists are totally inconsistent in affirming values like love and brotherhood, and that man cannot live with the idea that everything is permitted, as everything in him cries out to say that certain acts are wrong, really wrong.

- The document 'NBLM-AbsurdityWithoutGod-AllNotes' discusses the concept of absurdity without God, citing various references to support the argument that atheism leads to inconsistency and absurdity in human behavior and morality.

- [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae) critiques the idea that humans are merely biological entities, arguing that this perspective is inconsistent with human protests against injustices such as Nazi medical experiments, and that only the existence of God can provide a consistent basis for supporting women's rights and condemning evil acts.

- Craig also argues that in an atheistic reality, all evil acts would go unpunished and all good deeds would go unrewarded, citing the example of a communist torturer who justified his actions by proclaiming that there is no God or afterlife to punish evil, demonstrating the absurdity of atheism.

- Furthermore, Craig points out the inconsistency between what atheism logically entails and how people actually live and react, as society instinctively praises selfless actions and condemns evil, despite the lack of a logical basis for these reactions in an atheistic worldview.

- The concept of the "[Noble Lie](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/178dbe66-b055-4f08-bb01-9105f222a30f)" is also mentioned, referring to Dr. L. D. Rue's attempt to provide a secular alternative to traditional morality, which Craig argues is unworkable and highlights the absurdity of attempting to establish morality without a divine foundation.

- Overall, the document presents a critique of atheism, arguing that it leads to absurdity and inconsistency in human behavior and morality, and that only the existence of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) can provide a consistent and logical basis for human values and morality.

- The concept of a "Noble Lie" was proposed by Rue, which involves intentionally deceiving oneself or society into believing in objective value and truth in a relativistic, Godless world, in order to achieve social coherence and compel individuals beyond self-interest.

- Craig critiques the "Noble Lie" as unworkable and self-refuting, arguing that it functions like a placebo and loses its power once its fictional nature is recognized, making it impossible for individuals to genuinely believe a lie while knowing it is a lie.

- Craig also questions the inconsistency of an "elitist group of illuminati" who understand the lie sacrificing their self-interest for a known fiction, and contends that Rue's concern for social coherence and personal wholeness demonstrates that he has already affirmed the existence of objective goods, thus refuting his own relativistic premise.

- Craig argues that non-theistic solutions, such as the "Noble Lie", are unlivable because they force their adherents into intellectual inconsistencies and self-delusion, often involving the adoption of practices or beliefs that are logically incompatible with an atheistic worldview, or "smuggling in a God-substitute" or "borrowing" from a discarded theistic framework.

- The text suggests that exploring contemporary non-theistic philosophical movements and ethical frameworks, and how their proponents counter Craig's charges of inconsistency and self-delusion, could be a potential next step in understanding the construction of objective meaning, value, and purpose from a purely naturalistic perspective.

- [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae) argues that without the existence of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) and immortality, human life is fundamentally absurd, lacking ultimate meaning, value, and purpose, which leads to inescapable futility and despair, and he contends that atheism is unlivable for human beings because they cannot consistently and happily endure such a worldview.

- Craig presents Biblical [Christianity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) as the direct and sole consistent solution to life's absurdity, arguing that it uniquely provides the two conditions necessary for a meaningful, valuable, and purposeful life for man: God and immortality, with God's existence providing a transcendent grounding for objective meaning, value, and purpose, and immortality ensuring that individual lives and contributions are not ultimately futile upon death.

- According to Craig, the Christian worldview allows individuals to live consistently and happily, directly addressing and overcoming the problems of meaninglessness, valuelessness, and purposelessness that he attributes to atheism, and he suggests that even if the evidence for both atheism and Biblical Christianity were absolutely equal, a rational person should choose Biblical Christianity because it offers life, meaningfulness, and happiness over death, futility, and destruction.

## Critique of Non-Theistic Solutions

- Craig advises individuals struggling with [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c) to follow a path towards a solution through intellectual and literary engagement, such as reading C.S. Lewis's [Surprised by Joy](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b26855bc-8bd5-486b-b206-e0479b09838c) and investigating the historical credibility of Jesus's resurrection and the [Gospels](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/ffcff133-8520-4390-85bc-8c08ba358858), as well as experiential and spiritual openness, including seeking transcendent experiences through immersive music, appreciating artistic and natural beauty, daily prayer, and reflecting on Francis Thompson's poem The Hound of Heaven.

- Craig also critiques naturalistic and secular humanist attempts to address the perceived absurdity of life without [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), arguing that these attempts are ultimately inconsistent, self-delusional, borrowed from theism, or unworkable, and he dismisses these attempts as solutions to life's absurdity, instead promoting Biblical Christianity as the sole consistent solution.

- The sources implicitly offer two categories of solutions for overcoming life's absurdity: Craig's proposed solution of Biblical [Christianity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) and naturalistic and secular humanist attempts, which Craig extensively critiques and argues are ultimately unsuccessful in providing a meaningful, valuable, and purposeful life for human beings.

- The document 'NBLM-AbsurdityWithoutGod-AllNotes' discusses attempts to construct meaning and value without God from naturalistic and secular humanist perspectives, which [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae) critiques as inconsistent and self-delusional.

- Craig argues that philosophers like [Jean-Paul Sartre](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c84a5699-366a-40bb-a34e-d818850018bb) propose creating subjective meaning through personal choices and commitments, but this approach is flawed if life is objectively absurd, and he views it as "just fooling ourselves".

- Naturalists find significance in human endeavors such as science, medicine, and diplomacy, but Craig notes that these efforts ultimately "come to nothing" in an eternal sense, rendering them futile.

- Some thinkers, including [Francis Crick](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/03f0b61e-fa42-4d29-a6b8-1293d45fd495), [Fred Hoyle](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b8aca536-6bf5-469c-b0b3-d0d00f3819a4), and [Carl Sagan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9fedf250-9594-472a-8b6e-a8c338e18a2f), attribute personality to natural processes, which Craig sees as "smuggling in a God-substitute through the back door" because they cannot accept a universe governed by impersonal forces.

- Atheistic humanists affirm traditional values like love and brotherhood, but Craig highlights this as a "blatant inconsistency" given his view that "all things are permitted" without [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), and even [Bertrand Russell](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/4778111e-00e4-4561-8a04-94bc6613f195) admitted that his ethical views were "incredible" without God.

- Despite rejecting moral relativism in theory, figures like Jean-Paul Sartre practically reject radical relativism by condemning actions like anti-Semitism, demonstrating a recognition of inherent wrongness and a common human moral intuition.

- Craig notes that naturalistic responses to morality focus on earthly accountability through legal systems and social condemnation, but even atheists instinctively praise selfless acts, revealing an inconsistency with their worldview.

- The document suggests that human-derived values, moral sensibilities, and social accountability are all attempts to construct value and meaning without God, but these approaches are ultimately flawed and inconsistent according to Craig's critique.

- [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae) discusses naturalistic and secular humanist attempts to construct purpose, including the concept of self-determined purpose, where individuals and humanity collectively define their own purpose, but Craig dismisses this as "making up some purpose, which amounts to self-delusion" if life is truly purposeless.

- Naturalists also reject dehumanizing implications associated with a godless worldview, such as humans being viewed as "rats" or "guinea pigs", and instead affirm human dignity and value, but Craig argues that these protests are inconsistent with an atheistic worldview, as "in nature whatever is, is right", and only if God exists can human dignity be consistently supported.

- Another attempt to construct purpose is through collective human flourishing, where the focus is on contributing to the well-being of humanity as a whole, including justice, reducing suffering, fostering creativity, and ensuring sustainability, but Craig does not explicitly address the consistency of this approach in the provided text.

- Craig also outlines atheistic attempts to confront the "unlivability" of their worldview, including embracing existential reality with courage, as advocated by figures like [Bertrand Russell](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/4778111e-00e4-4561-8a04-94bc6613f195) and [Albert Camus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5aa7f182-29a0-42e6-8225-0c5e138f3558), who suggest living with "unyielding despair" or "human love and brotherhood", but Craig views these positions as inconsistent because they affirm values that their worldview denies.

- Additionally, Craig discusses the concept of the "[Noble Lie](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/178dbe66-b055-4f08-bb01-9105f222a30f)", proposed by Dr. L. D. Rue, where humanity intentionally deceives itself into believing in objective value and truth for "social coherence" and to "compel us beyond self-interest", but Craig argues that this approach is "unworkable" because it functions like a placebo and is inconsistent for the "enlightened" to sacrifice for a known fiction.

- The historical context of these secular philosophical responses is rooted in the Enlightenment era, where humanity shifted away from religious authority and towards reason, leading to the emergence of existential absurdity, and Craig argues that this has resulted in an absurd existence devoid of ultimate meaning, value, and purpose, as humanity has "killed [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8)" and thereby "killed himself".

- The late 19th century saw [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/373f531e-23bc-470c-9ea7-cb2e7cf5d82e) predict the emergence of [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c), which is the destruction of all meaning and value, as a result of the "death of God", with the masses initially unaware of the implications of this tremendous event.

- In the 20th century, various philosophers and artists responded to the implications of atheism, including [Samuel Beckett](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c95231cf-5226-4a31-b5c2-73711be32c50), who portrayed life as futile and meaningless in his plays, such as "Waiting for Godot", and existentialists like [Jean-Paul Sartre](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c84a5699-366a-40bb-a34e-d818850018bb) and Albert Camus, who acknowledged the inherent meaninglessness of life but proposed inconsistent solutions, such as creating meaning through free choice or living with unyielding despair.

- Other notable figures, such as Bertrand Russell and [Ernst Bloch](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/443710d6-f06a-431e-bc25-c456af4cd617), also responded to the implications of atheism, with Russell suggesting building life on "the firm foundation of unyielding despair" and Bloch theorizing that modern man "subconsciously borrows" belief in immortality from ancestors to cope with death, both of which are considered inconsistent by [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae).

## The Necessity of God for Meaning and Purpose

- The mid-to-late 20th century saw a confrontation with the dehumanizing implications of atheism, including the horrors of the Holocaust and [Auschwitz](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/992a21d8-3aa5-44ee-8c90-c7363acfde83), which showcased the consequences of a lack of objective morality, and the accounts of torturers justifying brutality by citing the absence of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) and ultimate punishment.

- William Lane Craig argues that atheists who protest against dehumanizing theories, such as feminist protests against Freudian chauvinism, are inconsistent in their claims that "in nature whatever is, is right", and that these protests reveal an implicit adherence to objective human value.

- Craig also critiques proposals such as Dr. L. D. Rue's "[Noble Lie](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/178dbe66-b055-4f08-bb01-9105f222a30f)" idea, which suggests that humanity should embrace a "Noble Lie" and deceive itself into believing in objective value and truth, as unworkable and self-refuting.

- From Craig's perspective, atheists continue to live with inconsistency and self-delusion, fabricating purpose, subconsciously borrowing belief in immortality, or smuggling in God-substitutes, all of which are deemed inconsistent with a truly atheistic worldview.

- The story of Adam, a contemporary atheist who struggles with the implications of [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c) and reaches out to Craig for guidance, illustrates the unlivable nature of nihilism and the need for a spiritual journey towards [Christian faith](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409), as advised by Craig.

- The document 'NBLM-AbsurdityWithoutGod-AllNotes' discusses the idea that atheism is unlivable because it leads to a life devoid of ultimate meaning, value, and purpose, as argued by [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae), a prominent Christian philosopher and theologian.

- Craig's arguments are supported by the experiences of individuals such as Adam, a self-proclaimed atheist and philosophy student who found his worldview shattered by the realization that nihilism is the logical conclusion of atheism, leading to profound depression and a search for a path out of his "nihilistic rut".

- The document references various philosophers, writers, and scientists, including Loren Eiseley, Paul Tillich, [Jean-Paul Sartre](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c84a5699-366a-40bb-a34e-d818850018bb), [Albert Camus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5aa7f182-29a0-42e6-8225-0c5e138f3558), [Samuel Beckett](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c95231cf-5226-4a31-b5c2-73711be32c50), [Fyodor Dostoyevsky](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/0e0bbbb8-5ef6-456d-9b73-f115052bfb2c), Ayn Rand, Kai Nielsen, [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/373f531e-23bc-470c-9ea7-cb2e7cf5d82e), H.G. Wells, and [Ernst Bloch](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/443710d6-f06a-431e-bc25-c456af4cd617), to illustrate the inconsistencies and implications of atheism, such as the absence of objective moral value and the difficulty of grounding ethics without [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8).

- Craig argues that Biblical Christianity is the only consistent and happy alternative to atheism, providing the two conditions necessary for a meaningful, valuable, and purposeful life for man: God and immortality, and that it is the rational choice even if evidence for theism and atheism were equal.

- The document also explores the concept of the "unlivability" of atheism, where people cannot consistently and happily endure a life utterly devoid of ultimate meaning, value, and purpose, and how this leads to profound unhappiness or requires "giving the lie to our world view", as seen in the examples of various philosophers and writers who have attempted to create meaning and purpose in an atheistic world, but ultimately failed to do so in a consistent and happy manner.

- Overall, the document presents a comprehensive argument for the idea that atheism is unlivable and that Biblical [Christianity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) is the only consistent and happy alternative, using a range of philosophical, literary, and scientific references to support its claims.

- [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae) critiques atheism by arguing that without the existence of God and immortality, human life and the universe are fundamentally "absurd" and lack ultimate meaning, value, and purpose.

- Craig references various thinkers, including [Francis Crick](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/03f0b61e-fa42-4d29-a6b8-1293d45fd495), [Fred Hoyle](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b8aca536-6bf5-469c-b0b3-d0d00f3819a4), and [Carl Sagan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9fedf250-9594-472a-8b6e-a8c338e18a2f), who he believes "smuggle in a God-substitute" by attributing human-like qualities to natural phenomena, highlighting the inability to live in a purely impersonal universe.

- He also cites the testimonies of individuals such as [Richard Wurmbrand](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/4fe1413a-3ce3-4e93-a0a2-1ace5a6ff03d), who endured torture under communist regimes, to illustrate the practical consequences of a world without ultimate moral accountability, where torturers justify their brutality by claiming "there is no [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), no Hereafter, no punishment for evil."

- Craig argues that atheistic thinkers like B.F. Skinner and Dr. L. D. Rue propose dehumanizing and self-refuting solutions, such as sociological behaviorism and the "[Noble Lie](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/178dbe66-b055-4f08-bb01-9105f222a30f)," which he believes are unworkable and inconsistent with human experience.

- He adopts Francis Schaeffer's "two-story universe" analogy to explain how atheists inconsistently "leap of faith" into a realm of meaning and purpose without a rational basis, and instead advocates for choosing Biblical Christianity, citing Blaise Pascal's "Pascal's Wager" as a rationale for this choice.

- Craig engages with various scholars and thinkers, including Martin Luther, Jonathan Crossley, and Lyn Marriner, to discuss the role of the Holy Spirit, transcendent reality, and the pursuit of spiritual truth, recommending the works of classical composers and poets like Schumann, Dvorak, and [Francis Thompson](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/ec7a50fe-a6c4-48db-ba41-de619b745d89) to help experience this reality.

- He also recommends investigating the debates between New Testament critics like John Dominic Crossan and Gerd Lüdemann, and notes his own work on the historicity of Jesus's resurrection, conducted under the guidance of his doctoral advisor, Wolfhart Pannenberg.

- Throughout his critique, Craig aims to demonstrate [the absurdity of life without God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/0bcbfb2f-2650-4cdc-b01a-572b52b61228) and the [Christian](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) alternative, which he believes provides a rational and meaningful framework for understanding human existence and the universe.

- [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae) posits that if [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) does not exist, individuals are merely accidental by-products of nature, born into a purposeless universe, and are ultimately doomed to death and oblivion, rendering all efforts and contributions meaningless in the long run.

## The Implications of Atheism on Morality

- Craig emphasizes that the entire human race and the universe itself face a "cold death," leading to a "universe in ruins" where its existence, and ours, ultimately makes "no difference," and that even mere endless existence would be "utterly without meaning" without a divine context.

- Craig claims that atheism is "unlivable" for human beings because, while it might logically lead to the conclusion of life's absurdity, it is "impossible to live consistently and happily" within such a worldview, and that atheists are trapped in a dilemma: if they live consistently with [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c), they will be "profoundly unhappy"; if they live happily, it is "only by giving the lie to our world view."

- Craig identifies several "inconsistencies" and "self-delusions" in atheistic attempts to construct meaning, including the critique of subjective meaning, as seen in Jean-Paul Sartre's attempt to "create meaning for his life by freely choosing to follow a certain course of action," which Craig argues is "utterly inconsistent" and an "exercise in self-delusion."

- Craig also critiques the idea of subconsciously borrowed immortality, as proposed by [Ernst Bloch](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/443710d6-f06a-431e-bc25-c456af4cd617), where modern man "subconsciously borrows the belief in immortality" from his ancestors to cope with death, which Craig views as an inconsistency and a "leap of faith to affirm a reason for living" for which the atheist "has no right" or rational basis within their worldview.

- Additionally, Craig observes that some thinkers, such as [Francis Crick](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/03f0b61e-fa42-4d29-a6b8-1293d45fd495), [Fred Hoyle](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b8aca536-6bf5-469c-b0b3-d0d00f3819a4), and [Carl Sagan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9fedf250-9594-472a-8b6e-a8c338e18a2f), "smuggle in God-substitutes" by ascribing personality and motives to physical processes, which he asserts is a "bizarre way of speaking" and a form of "smuggling in a God-substitute through the back door."

- Craig argues that objective moral values cannot exist in an atheistic worldview, claiming that without [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) and immortality, "there can be no objective standards of right and wrong," reducing morality to "expressions of personal taste or the by-products of socio-biological evolution and conditioning," and that "all things are permitted" if there is no God and no ultimate accountability.

- Craig uses the horrors of [Auschwitz](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/992a21d8-3aa5-44ee-8c90-c7363acfde83) and the testimony of communist torturers who justified their brutality by proclaiming "There is no God, no Hereafter, no punishment for evil" to illustrate the implications of an atheistic worldview on morality, stating that "good and evil do not exist—there is only the bare valueless fact of existence," and the "concept of moral obligation [is] unintelligible apart from the idea of God."

- The concept of a world without objective moral constraints is considered "unlivable" by Dr. Craig, as it would mean that evil acts go unpunished and good deeds unrewarded, highlighting the need for a moral framework that provides accountability and motivation.

- Dr. L.D. Rue's proposal of the "[Noble Lie](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/178dbe66-b055-4f08-bb01-9105f222a30f)" suggests that humanity should deceive itself into believing in objective value and truth, despite intellectual convictions in relativism and atheism, in order to achieve social coherence and compel individuals to act beyond self-interest.

- Dr. Craig argues that the "Noble Lie" is "unworkable" due to several reasons, including the loss of efficacy once the lie is seen through, the inconsistency of an elitist group sacrificing their self-interest for a known fiction, and the self-refutation of valuing social coherence and personal wholeness as objective goods while denying their objective existence.

- Adam, an atheist and philosophy student, personally validates Dr. Craig's arguments about [the absurdity of life without God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/0bcbfb2f-2650-4cdc-b01a-572b52b61228), as he struggled with the nihilistic implications of atheism, leading to profound depression and a desire for the existence of God, despite being unable to believe in one.

- Dr. Craig offers advice to atheists like Adam who are struggling with [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c), recommending intellectual and literary engagement with [Christian](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) texts and ideas, such as reading C.S. Lewis's [Surprised by Joy](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/b26855bc-8bd5-486b-b206-e0479b09838c) and the [Gospels](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/ffcff133-8520-4390-85bc-8c08ba358858), as well as experiential and spiritual openness to transcendent experiences and prayer.

- Dr. Craig also suggests practical and community engagement, such as attending a church and getting to know Christians, in order to provide a supportive environment for spiritual exploration and growth, and to link the acceptance of objective moral values to a spiritual need for redemption.

- Ultimately, Dr. Craig presents the Christian faith as a solution to the "absurdity of life without [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8)," arguing that it provides a rational and fulfilling alternative to the nihilism and despair that can result from a relativistic and atheistic worldview, and that it offers a sense of purpose, meaning, and moral direction that is essential for human flourishing.

- [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae) presents Biblical Christianity as the definitive alternative to the "absurdity of life without God", arguing that it uniquely provides the two conditions necessary for a meaningful, valuable, and purposeful life: God and immortality, which establish that life is not an accident but part of a divine plan.

- According to Craig, God's existence provides a transcendent, objective grounding for meaning, value, and purpose, while immortality ensures that individual lives and contributions have lasting significance beyond the grave through eternal life and fellowship with God.

- Craig concludes that this framework allows individuals to "live consistently and happily", directly overcoming the problems of meaninglessness, valuelessness, and purposelessness that he attributes to atheism, and controversially suggests that even if the evidence for both atheism and Biblical Christianity were "absolutely equal", a rational person should choose Biblical Christianity.

- In an atheistic worldview, Craig argues that the individual is "doomed to death" with "no hope of immortality", reduced to a "spark that appears, flickers, and dies forever", evoking the terrifying realization that one's self will cease to exist, and that the universe's eventual "cold death" contributes to absurdity because it means the universe itself is "without ultimate significance" and "utterly pointless".

- Craig believes that objective moral values cannot exist without God, because without a divine law-giver, morality becomes mere "expressions of personal taste or the by-products of socio-biological evolution and conditioning", implying that it's impossible to objectively condemn war, oppression, or crime as "evil", because "good and evil do not exist".

- Craig criticizes Jean-Paul Sartre's attempt to "create meaning" through free choice as "utterly inconsistent" if life is "objectively absurd" to begin with, and also argues that thinkers like [Bertrand Russell](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/4778111e-00e4-4561-8a04-94bc6613f195) and [Albert Camus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5aa7f182-29a0-42e6-8225-0c5e138f3558) demonstrate "inconsistencies" in their ethical views.

## The Role of Immortality in Providing Meaning

- Craig accuses some scientists and thinkers of "smuggling in a God-substitute" in their non-theistic worldview, and argues that human protests against dehumanizing theories are inconsistent for an atheist, ultimately concluding that a rational person should choose Biblical [Christianity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409), even if the evidence for both theistic and atheistic worldviews were equal, as it is "positively irrational to prefer death, futility, and destruction to life, meaningfulness, and happiness".

- According to [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae), atheists such as Bertrand Russell and Albert Camus demonstrate inconsistencies in their beliefs, as they acknowledge life's absurdity and deny objective values, yet affirm traditional ethical values like human love and brotherhood, and denounce societal wrongs like war, which Craig sees as inconsistent with their atheistic worldview.

- Craig argues that some atheists, such as [Ernst Bloch](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/443710d6-f06a-431e-bc25-c456af4cd617), rely on remnants of a discarded belief in immortality to cope with the reality of death and maintain a sense of purpose, which he calls "living from earlier hopes" on a "borrowed credit card", as they have no rational basis for such a belief within their own worldview.

- Craig also critiques thinkers like [Francis Crick](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/03f0b61e-fa42-4d29-a6b8-1293d45fd495) and [Carl Sagan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9fedf250-9594-472a-8b6e-a8c338e18a2f), who he claims "smuggle in a God-substitute through the back door" by attributing human-like qualities to natural forces, which he sees as an attempt to escape the implications of a universe governed by impersonal forces.

- Craig's argument is that, from a logical atheistic standpoint, "in nature whatever is, is right", and therefore, there is no objective basis to protest dehumanizing implications as morally wrong, revealing an unconscious adherence to objective human value that only God's existence can consistently support.

- Craig concludes that, even if the evidence for both atheism and Biblical Christianity were equal, a rational person should choose Biblical Christianity, as it offers "life, meaningfulness, and happiness" through the provision of [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) and immortality, which ground ultimate meaning, value, and purpose, whereas atheism only offers "death, futility, and destruction".

- The text also raises several essay questions, including analyzing Craig's definition of "ultimate meaning, value, and purpose" and how a non-theistic philosopher might challenge these definitions, critically evaluating Craig's "two-story universe" analogy, and comparing and contrasting Craig's portrayal of [Jean-Paul Sartre](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c84a5699-366a-40bb-a34e-d818850018bb) and [Albert Camus](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5aa7f182-29a0-42e6-8225-0c5e138f3558), among other topics.

- Additionally, the text discusses Craig's argument against the "[Noble Lie](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/178dbe66-b055-4f08-bb01-9105f222a30f)" proposed by L.D. Rue, and how he uses real-world examples to support his argument about the absence of ultimate moral value in an atheistic worldview, which can be seen as an attempt to demonstrate the [practical impossibility of atheism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/4e7b07ee-e951-4be9-a4f3-990a3d6a30c2).

- The concept of absurdity of life without God, as proposed by [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae), suggests that human existence and the universe are devoid of meaning, value, and purpose if God does not exist, leading to inherent futility and despair.

- Craig describes humanity in an atheistic worldview as an accidental by-product of nature, resulting from "matter plus time plus chance" with no reason for existence, and he terms humans as "cosmic orphans" who ask "Why?" but find no answers in a universe without God.

- The worldview of Biblical [Christianity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) is presented by Craig as the solution to life's absurdity, providing God and immortality as the necessary conditions for ultimate meaning, value, and purpose, and he critiques [existentialism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5b225ea8-1691-4de6-8ff5-fbc225102853), a philosophical movement that acknowledges the inherent meaninglessness of existence without a pre-given essence.

- Craig argues that some non-theistic thinkers, such as Crick, Hoyle, and [Sagan](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/9fedf250-9594-472a-8b6e-a8c338e18a2f), implicitly or explicitly attribute personality or divine-like qualities to natural processes or the universe, which he terms as "God-substitutes", and he identifies inconsistencies in atheism, where atheists attempt to live happily or morally despite the logical implications of a Godless worldview.

- The concept of immortality is also necessary, alongside [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8), for life to have ultimate significance according to Craig, and without it, individual lives and contributions become meaningless upon death, and he argues that moral obligation and objective moral standards cannot exist without God.

- Craig critiques [naturalism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/e674fe07-8aae-4c03-92ea-81c56d5254fb), naturalistic ethics, and [secular humanism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3ad14c44-ae3c-482e-a110-871e99b29c4d) as inconsistent or self-delusional, and he argues that [nihilism](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/40da5e0d-68b7-475c-8769-7fb300b2054c), the philosophical belief that life is without objective meaning or intrinsic value, is a logical consequence of a Godless worldview, and he rejects the idea of a "[noble lie](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/178dbe66-b055-4f08-bb01-9105f222a30f)" as a proposal to intentionally deceive humanity into believing in objective value and truth.

- The idea of a "lower story" in Francis Schaeffer's analogy represents the finite, Godless world where life is logically absurd, devoid of ultimate meaning, value, and purpose, and Craig argues that ultimate meaning and purpose can only be achieved with the existence of God and immortality.

- Overall, Craig's central thesis is that without God, human existence and the universe are ultimately devoid of meaning, value, and purpose, and he presents Biblical Christianity as the solution to this absurdity, providing a framework for ultimate significance, moral obligation, and objective moral standards.

- [William Lane Craig](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/43d29457-a88f-48f9-9a85-963031daa8ae), a prominent [Christian](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) philosopher, argues that without the existence of God and immortality, human life and the universe are inherently "absurd" due to a complete lack of ultimate meaning, value, and purpose.

- Craig critiques atheism as "unlivable" for human beings because they cannot consistently and happily endure a worldview that lacks ultimate meaning, value, and purpose, and he dismisses naturalistic and secular humanist attempts to construct these elements as "inconsistent" or "unworkable".

- The concept of the "two-story universe", an analogy by [Francis Schaeffer](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/182bd2b2-7c57-4389-9c87-a7e70ae43caf), is used by Craig to describe the predicament of modern man, who lives in the "lower story" (a finite, Godless, absurd world) but continually makes "leaps of faith" into the "upper story" (where meaning, value, and purpose reside with [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8)) to live happily, despite lacking a rational basis for doing so within their worldview.

- Craig argues that the absence of ultimate meaning, value, and purpose leads to a state of absurdity, characterized by the ultimate futility of all existence, and he emphasizes the "horror of modern man" who ends in nothing and is therefore nothing, a concept also described by Paul Tillich as "the threat of non-being".

## Conclusion

- The absence of ultimate meaning is further broken down into individual mortality and futility, cosmic and human doom, and the insufficiency of mere immortality, all of which contribute to [the absurdity of life without God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/0bcbfb2f-2650-4cdc-b01a-572b52b61228), and Craig proposes Biblical [Christianity](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/08faad47-c4cc-4411-9f03-08771e32d409) as the sole consistent and livable alternative, offering ultimate meaning, value, and purpose.

- Craig also argues that without God, "good and evil do not exist", and morality becomes subjective, and he associates the existence of God with the "upper story" where ultimate meaning, value, and purpose reside, and he contends that atheism is unable to provide a rational basis for objective moral standards.

- Overall, Craig's critique of atheism is that it is absurd and unlivable, and he argues that human beings cannot consistently and happily endure a worldview that lacks ultimate meaning, value, and purpose, and he presents Biblical Christianity as a more fulfilling and meaningful alternative.

- The concept of life without [God](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6c81a688-169e-4787-8067-4e1972a643c8) is explored, with the idea that both God and immortality are required for ultimate significance, as illustrated by the analogy of an astronaut living forever on a barren rock with an unending life that is "utterly without meaning".
