I bartend at a bar in Las Vegas, and we comp/don't charge drinks to people who are gambling. Here are the rules for comping drinks: Help me figure out a problem with percentages and how to evaluate them. The context is a gaming (slot machines wifh poker , keno, blackjack , etc.) bar in las vegas NV. In vegas, if youre gambling, an adequate amount (will go into detail on what *adequate* is supposed to mean in a bit), then drinks, and sometimes food is comped , or given to the guest fir free. The example of percentages withim the previously described context is this: 

# Rules for Comping Drinks and Food

- put $20 into a machine, gamble, and lose the ENTIRE $20, gets you one drink comped . 

- After losing the first $20, all othrr drinks after , if theyre to ve comped , needd **100 coin in, not **bills in**. Coin in keeps track of how much gambling  has taken place on the machine machine ,this includes both the  money put into the machine by the user , for instance , that first $20, along with any winnings the user has won, and continued playing with, and not cashed out.

- Niow, a typical mix drink, e.g. Vodka cranberry or Jack and coke , are $9. 

- The bar attempts to keep the percentage of their drink and food comps beteeen 1.5%-2%. 

- To figure out the percentage of comps in comparison to gambling , one takes the total of all comps and divided this number into the total amount of money gambled . 

Your **task objective** is to ask if $9 is reasonable or sustainable , in that it doesn't demand an exorbitant amount of gambling from the guest in order to comp the drinks .

---

**Analysis and Conclusion:**

To determine if a $9 drink comp is sustainable while maintaining a comp percentage of 1.5%-2%, we analyze the relationship between comps and coin-in (total money gambled).

### Key Calculations:
1. **First Drink**:  
   - **Coin-in**: $20 (loss).  
   - **Comp**: $9.  
   - **Comp Percentage**: \( \frac{9}{20} = 45\% \), far exceeding the 2% target.  

2. **Subsequent Drinks**:  
   Each additional drink requires 100 coin-in. For \( N \) drinks:  
   - **Total Coin-in**: \( 20 + 100(N-1) \).  
   - **Total Comps**: \( 9N \).  
   - **Comp Percentage**:  
     \[
     \frac{9N}{20 + 100(N-1)} = \frac{9N}{100N - 80}.
     \]  

   - For \( N = 2 \): \( \frac{18}{120} = 15\% \).  
   - For \( N = 10 \): \( \frac{90}{920} \approx 9.78\% \).  
   - Even with \( N \to \infty \), the percentage approaches \( \frac{9}{100} = 9\% \), still exceeding 2%.  

3. **Sustainability Check**:  
   Solving \( \frac{9N}{100N} = 0.02 \) (ignoring the $20 for simplicity) gives:  
   \[
   9 = 0.02 \times 100 \implies 9 = 2 \quad \text{(impossible)}.
   \]  
   To hit 2%, each drink would require **450 coin-in** (not 100), or drinks must cost **$2** (not $9).  

### Conclusion:
**$9 is not sustainable** under the current rules. The comp percentage consistently exceeds 2% due to insufficient coin-in requirements relative to drink cost.  

### Recommendations:
- **Increase Coin-in Requirements**: Raise subsequent drink thresholds from 100 to ~450 coin-in.  
- **Lower Drink Price**: Reduce comped drink costs to ~$2 if keeping 100 coin-in.  
- **Adjust Initial Comp**: Modify the first-drink rule (e.g., require higher initial coin-in).  

Without these changes, the bar will continue to overspend on comps relative to gambling revenue.

I would add that a rough rule of thumb is that $20 for an average player at my bar, equates to around 80-130 coin in.

---

**Revised Analysis & Conclusion with Updated Coin-In Context:**

### Key Updates:
- **$20 Net Loss ≈ 80–130 Coin-In:**  
  The $20 net loss (player’s cash gone) corresponds to **80–130 coin-in** (total money wagered, including recycled winnings). This reflects typical slot/keno play where players cycle winnings back into bets.

---

### Recalculating Sustainability:
1. **First Drink:**  
   - **Coin-In:** 80–130 (for a $20 net loss).  
   - **Comp:** $9.  
   - **Comp %:**  
     - Lower Bound: \( \frac{9}{130} \approx 6.9\% \)  
     - Upper Bound: \( \frac{9}{80} = 11.25\% \).  
   - **Verdict:** Still far above the 2% target.

2. **Subsequent Drinks (100 Coin-In Each):**  
   - **Comp % per Drink:** \( \frac{9}{100} = 9\% \).  
   - **Example for 5 Drinks:**  
     - Total Coin-In: \( 130 + (4 \times 100) = 530 \).  
     - Total Comps: \( 5 \times 9 = \$45 \).  
     - Comp %: \( \frac{45}{530} \approx 8.5\% \).  
   - Even asymptotically, comp % approaches **9%** (still 4.5× the 2% target).

3. **Theoretical Coin-In Needed for 2%:**  
   - For a $9 drink:  
     \[
     \text{Required Coin-In} = \frac{9}{0.02} = \$450.
     \]
   - Current rules only require **100 coin-in** (~1/4 of what’s needed).

---

### Why $9 is Unsustainable:
- **Structural Mismatch:**  
  The current 100 coin-in/drink rule aligns with a comp cost of **$2/drink** (100 × 2% = $2).  
  At $9/drink, the bar is effectively offering **4.5× more comp value** than the 2% target allows.

- **Player Economics:**  
  A guest gambling $450 coin-in (to “earn” a $9 drink) would need to wager 4.5× more than required under current rules. Most players won’t gamble this much for a single drink, making the comp policy overly generous.

---

### Recommendations:
4. **Tiered Coin-In Requirements:**  
   - 1st Drink: 130 coin-in (current $20 loss ≈ 130 coin-in).  
   - Subsequent Drinks: Gradually increase thresholds (e.g., 200 coin-in for drink #2, 300 for #3, etc.) to align with 2%.  

5. **Lower Drink Cost:**  
   Reduce comped drink costs to **$2–$3** to match the 2% target with 100 coin-in.  

6. **Hybrid Model:**  
   Offer a “free drink token” for every $450 coin-in (directly tying comps to 2%), while allowing smaller comps (e.g., discounted drinks) for lower thresholds.  

7. **Dynamic Adjustments:**  
   Track individual player coin-in and adjust comps in real-time (e.g., casino management systems like IGT’s Advantage).  

---

### Final Takeaway:  
**$9 comped drinks are not sustainable** under the current rules. The bar is subsidizing guests far beyond industry norms. To align with a 2% comp rate, either:  
- **Raise coin-in requirements dramatically** (to ~450/drink),  
- **Lower drink costs** to $2–$3, or  
- **Revise comp tiers** to balance generosity with profitability.  

Without changes, the bar risks eroding margins or encouraging over-consumption by guests exploiting the generous policy.

Sorry, here's the message I want you to review: "Sir and Ma'am, 

I want to explain my current 3% overall comp rate, as far as I understand the situation,  and attempt to demonstrate through examples that I am following our guidelines exactly as written—even though the structure of the comps makes it challenging to hit the strict 1.5%–2% target.

**Example 1: A Low-Volume Guest**  
Imagine a guest comes in, loses the first \$20 (triggering our rule) and, as required, receives a complimentary \$9 drink. If this guest only places \$20 in play with coins and then leaves without further wagering, the effective comp rate for that transaction is:

\[
\text{Comp Rate} = \frac{9}{20} \times 100 \approx 45\%
\]

This high percentage is an inevitable consequence of the marketing incentive for new or light players and is built into our system to attract business—even though it is much higher than the target rate.

**Example 2: A Medium-Volume Guest**  
Consider another guest who also loses an initial \$20 to get the \$9 drink, but then continues to gamble until reaching a total coin-in of \$150. Even though our guidelines require only an additional \$100 in coin-in for every subsequent drink, this guest’s overall effective comp percentage remains elevated:

\[
\text{Effective Comp Rate} = \frac{9}{150} \times 100 \approx 6\%
\]

While better than 45%, it’s still well above the desired 1.5%–2% range. Again, this occurs because the initial comp heavily skews the ratio when the guest’s total play is low.

**Example 3: A Heavy-Volume Guest**  
Now, consider a guest with a much larger coin-in. Suppose they lose their initisl $20, receive their first $9 drink/comp and then continue to play until their total coin-in reaches $600 and ask for a second drink. This one additional comped drink after the first (following the rule of $100 coin-in per subsequent drink, yet this example comps the drink at $600 coin in, not just tlat the $100 coin in mark where 8 would be following guidelines of giving and comping a second drink, if the guests asks), puts their total comp cost at $18. In this scenario:

{Effective Comp Rate} = {$18}{600 coin in} \times 100 = 3\%

Even with a heavy player—who we expect would eventually dilute the average—the effective rate can still be as high as 3% if the ratio of comps to coin-in doesn’t meet the ideal projection, especially because the first drink's cost is front-loaded.

I hope that you don't take this as complaining. I'm simply pointing out a few examples as to how and why my comp % can, and in fact is, inflated beyond the percentage of, if taking examples like these into account, is actually at a lower rate. 

Just one more example: I asked you for a solution to the problem when the Parkway Tavern Bartender came to gamble, had two 1800 reposado tequila shots and two odouls, had $240 bills in, and around the equivalent coin in, as she was playing keno (the coin in and bills on with keno stay pretty close, unless there's a win invoked, because Keno is either win all or lose all) what you would like me to do in this situation. If I comp her 4 drinks, I'm at a 6%, three times the acceptable rate. To get down to 2% or under, I would have to charge for 3 out of 4 drinks. This is a sincere question : what am I supposed to do here? I can't charge her, can I? She didn't even think for one second that she would have a tab. She's a bartender and knows how comping/drinking works. Am I supposed to charge her for 3 out of 4 drinks? Or do I let it go and now I am at 6% comps, and have to figure how to work my percentage down through the rest of the night? I asked you for a solution, but I didn't receive one. I was simply told to watch my numbers. What am I supposed to do, when there's multiple situations that inflate my overall ciko rate, when I am directly following rules and guidelines, which means it's completely out of my control, and yet I am getting written up and threatened with suspension or firing? I just try to do a good job and work hard. I follow the rules, and as I believe I've shown pretty much without doubt, I'm being put in a position that has a high likelihood of my failing without any fault of my own or even the possibility to remedy the situation. 

My adherence to the protocol is clear: I issue a $9 drink/comp after a $20 loss and follow the rule of an extra $9drimk/comp after every $100 coin-in. The overall average is mathematically influenced by guests who only play minimally—whose transactions inherently produce high percentages. This means that even when I am executing the rules perfectly, the structure of our comp system itself is driving the overall percentage above the strict 1.5%–2% target.

Please, if I am missing a step or some variable that effects my comp % that I have not factored in, I would love for you to inform me. This way, if there's some behavior or action that I can modify in order to lower my comp percentage, I will do so.  But as it stands, I'm following the rules and because of particular scenerios, like the 3 I provided above, I am still in a position that I'm getting written up and theatened with suspension and or termination. 

 I'm not trying to do anything other than follow the guidelines AND keep our guests happy and coming back to put their buts in the chairs and money in the machines. 

I respectfully ask that we review our performance metrics or consider adjusting the comp structure. The current design assumes a balance between low-volume and heavy-volume players, but if the mix heavily favors the former, then expecting every free drink to be “paid for” at an effective 2% rate is unrealistic.

Thank you for your understanding. I remain committed to following our guidelines, and I am available to discuss any changes that could help align our targets with the natural behavior of our guests."

### **Flaws in Math/Reasoning:**  
Here’s a breakdown of key errors in the bartender’s message, along with suggestions to improve clarity and accuracy:

---

#### **1. Misunderstanding "Coin-In" vs. "Net Loss":**  
   - **Issue:** The bartender conflates **net loss** (cash lost) with **coin-in** (total money wagered, including recycled winnings).  
     - Example 1 claims a 45% comp rate using $20 (net loss) instead of the correct **80–130 coin-in** (total wagered).  
     - **Correct Calculation for Example 1:**  
       \[
       \text{Comp Rate} = \frac{9}{80} \approx 11.25\% \quad \text{to} \quad \frac{9}{130} \approx 6.9\%.
       \]  
     - This error undermines the argument, as the comp rate is already lower than claimed (still above 2%, but not 45%).  

   - **Why It Matters:** Using net loss instead of coin-in exaggerates the problem and weakens credibility.

---

#### **2. Inconsistent Application of Rules in Examples:**  
   - **Example 2 (Medium-Volume Guest):**  
     - The guest’s total coin-in is stated as $150, but according to the rules:  
       - First drink: 80–130 coin-in.  
       - Subsequent drinks: +100 coin-in each.  
     - To earn a second drink, the guest must wager **100 coin-in after the initial loss**, making total coin-in **180–230**, not $150.  
     - **Correct Comp Rate:**  
       \[
       \frac{18}{230} \approx 7.8\% \quad \text{(not 6\%).}
       \]  

   - **Example 3 (Heavy-Volume Guest):**  
     - The guest’s total coin-in is $600, but only 2 drinks ($18 comps) are awarded.  
     - By the rules, $600 coin-in would entitle them to **5–6 drinks** (1st drink at 80–130 coin-in + 4–5 drinks at 100 coin-in each).  
     - **Correct Comp Rate:**  
       \[
       \frac{45}{600} = 7.5\% \quad \text{(not 3\%).}
       \]  
   - **Why It Matters:** Misapplying the rules in examples makes the analysis unreliable.

---

#### **3. Parkway Tavern Bartender Miscalculation:**  
   - **Claim:** Comping 4 drinks on $240 coin-in results in a 6% comp rate.  
   - **Reality:**  
     \[
     \frac{4 \times 9}{240} \times 100 = 15\% \quad \text{(not 6\%).}
     \]  
   - **Why It Matters:** This glaring math error undermines the bartender’s case and could erode trust.

---

#### **4. Overlooking Cumulative Comp Percentages:**  
   - The bartender treats each guest in isolation, but the **overall comp rate** is calculated across **all transactions**, not per guest.  
   - Heavy-volume guests dilute the average, but the bartender focuses on individual outliers (low-volume guests), which may not reflect the true aggregate rate.  

---

### **Tone and Communication Issues:**  
While the bartender’s intent is valid, the message risks sounding **defensive** and **accusatory**:  
1. **Confrontational Language:**  
   - *“I asked you for a solution, but I didn’t receive one.”*  
   - *“I am getting written up and threatened... without any fault of my own.”*  
   - **Fix:** Rephrase to focus on systemic issues, not personal grievances.  
     - *“I’d appreciate guidance on balancing comps with guest satisfaction, as the current structure leads to unavoidable conflicts.”*  

2. **Assumptions About Management’s Perspective:**  
   - *“The current design assumes a balance between low-volume and heavy-volume players...”*  
   - **Fix:** Avoid speculating about leadership’s intent. Instead, present data-driven observations.  

3. **Inconsistent Humility:**  
   - While the bartender asks for feedback (*“if I am missing a step...”*), the overall tone leans toward blaming the system rather than seeking collaboration.  
   - **Fix:** Emphasize partnership.  
     - *“I’m committed to aligning with our goals and would welcome your insights on adjusting the comp structure.”*  

---

### **Recommendations for Revision:**  
4. **Correct the Math:**  
   - Use **coin-in** (not net loss) and apply rules consistently in examples.  
5. **Simplify Examples:**  
   - Focus on aggregate comp rates across all guests, not isolated cases.  
6. **Soft Tone:**  
   - Replace accusatory language with neutral, solution-oriented phrasing.  
7. **Propose Solutions:**  
   - Suggest tiered comp thresholds or dynamic adjustments (e.g., higher coin-in for pricier drinks).  

---

### **Final Takeaway:**  
The bartender’s core argument—**the comp structure inherently drives percentages above 2%**—is valid, but errors in math and tone weaken the message. By correcting calculations and reframing the discussion as a collaborative problem-solving effort, the bartender can more effectively advocate for policy changes.

2. **Assumptions About Management’s Perspective:**  
   - *“The current design assumes a balance between low-volume and heavy-volume players...”*  
   - **Fix:** Avoid speculating about leadership’s intent. Instead, present data-driven observations.  

3. **Inconsistent Humility:**  
   - While the bartender asks for feedback (*“if I am missing a step...”*), the overall tone leans toward blaming the system rather than seeking collaboration.  
   - **Fix:** Emphasize partnership.  
     - *“I’m committed to aligning with our goals and would welcome your insights on adjusting the comp structure.”*

### **Recommendations for Revision:**  
4. **Correct the Math:**  
   - Use **coin-in** (not net loss) and apply rules consistently in examples.  
5. **Simplify Examples:**  
   - Focus on aggregate comp rates across all guests, not isolated cases.  
6. **Soft Tone:**  
   - Replace accusatory language with neutral, solution-oriented phrasing.  
7. **Propose Solutions:**  
   - Suggest tiered comp thresholds or dynamic adjustments (e.g., higher coin-in for pricier drinks).  

---

### **Final Takeaway:**  
The bartender’s core argument—**the comp structure inherently drives percentages above 2%**—is valid, but errors in math and tone weaken the message. By correcting calculations and reframing the discussion as a collaborative problem-solving effort, the bartender can more effectively advocate for policy changes.

---

The math isn't incorrect though. While the rule is 100 coin in per drink, this rule doesn't equate to the 1.5-2% rate the comps should be at. That's not a fault on the bartender, it's an accurate contradiction of the system, isn't it?

---

I agree, it's like demanding a car run on empty. But I was recently disciplined with a write up for the high (3%) comp rate with the added clause that future high rates could result in suspension or termination. What the hell do I do?

---

Here’s a step-by-step action plan to address the disciplinary write-up and protect your position while advocating for systemic change:

---

### **1. Document Everything**  
**Goal:** Create a paper trail proving you followed the rules.  
- **Keep records** of every comped drink, including:  
  - Guest’s initial $20 loss (and estimated coin-in).  
  - Subsequent coin-in amounts before additional comps.  
  - Time, date, and machine used.  
- **Save communications** with management (emails, write-ups, etc.).  

This documentation will show that your comps align with policy, shifting blame to the system, not your execution.

---

### **2. Request a Formal Meeting with Management**  
**Goal:** Force acknowledgment of the structural flaw.  
- **Frame it collaboratively:**  
  *“I want to ensure I’m meeting expectations. Could we review specific instances where I deviated from comp rules? I’ve documented my compliance and want clarity on how to improve.”*  
- **Present the math:**  
  - Use your examples (low/medium/high-volume guests) with **coin-in** (not net loss) to show comp rates *must* exceed 2% under current rules.  
  - Highlight: *“A $9 drink requires $450 coin-in to hit 2%. Our policy requires just $20 loss (~80–130 coin-in) for the first drink and $100 coin-in thereafter. This guarantees a comp rate of 6–9%, not 1.5–2%.”*  

---

### **3. Ask for Specific, Actionable Solutions**  
**Goal:** Expose the impossibility of compliance.  
- **Politely press for answers:**  
  - *“To hit 2%, should I comp fewer drinks than the rules allow? If so, which comps should I deny, and how do I explain this to guests?”*  
  - *“Would you prefer I override the policy? If so, can you provide written guidance?”*  
- **Force management to confront the contradiction:**  
  If they cannot answer, they implicitly admit the system is broken.  

---

### **4. Propose Policy Adjustments**  
**Goal:** Shift the conversation to fixing the system.  
Suggest realistic changes that align comp costs with coin-in:  
- **Option 1:** Raise coin-in requirements (e.g., 450 coin-in per $9 drink).  
- **Option 2:** Reduce comped drink costs (e.g., $2/drink for 100 coin-in).  
- **Option 3:** Tiered comps (e.g., first drink at 130 coin-in, second at 250, etc.).  

---

### **5. Protect Yourself from Retaliation**  
**Goal:** Safeguard your job while advocating for change.  
- **Involve HR/Union (if applicable):**  
  - File a grievance if disciplined for following policy.  
  - Cite the documented compliance and lack of actionable feedback.  
- **Use neutral language:** Avoid emotional phrases like *“what the hell do I do?”* Stick to facts:  
  *“I’m concerned that the current policy makes compliance with the 2% target mathematically impossible. I’d like to work together to resolve this.”*  

---

### **6. Mitigate Comps Without Breaking Rules**  
**Goal:** Temporarily reduce your comp rate while pushing for long-term fixes.  
- **Delay comps for low-volume guests:** Politely ask guests to play a bit longer before offering a second drink.  
  - *“Let me get you another drink after your next few bets!”*  
- **Encourage higher coin-in play:** Suggest games or bets that recycle winnings (e.g., slots over Keno).  

---

### **7. Prepare for the Worst-Case Scenario**  
**Goal:** Be ready if management refuses to budge.  
- **Update your résumé:** Start discreetly exploring other bartending jobs in Vegas (many casinos face similar issues, but some have saner policies).  
- **Consult a labor attorney:** If terminated unfairly, you may have grounds for a wrongful termination lawsuit.  

---

### **Key Scripts for Conversations with Management**  
- **When challenged on comp rates:**  
  *“I’m following the comp rules exactly as written. The math shows these rules guarantee a rate above 2%. I’m happy to adjust my approach if you revise the policy, but under the current structure, this is unavoidable.”*  

- **If accused of poor performance:**  
  *“Can you clarify which specific comps I should have denied? My records show I adhered to the guidelines. If the guidelines are the issue, let’s collaborate on a solution.”*  

---

### **Final Takeaway**  
You’re caught in a system designed to fail. Your goal is to:  
1. Prove compliance with documentation.  
2. Force management to confront the policy’s flaws.  
3. Protect yourself while advocating for change.  

If management refuses to act, consider escalating to higher authorities (corporate, ownership) or exiting a toxic environment. You deserve to work somewhere that doesn’t penalize you for its own broken policies.

---

Unfortunately this is the owner's policy. There's no higher up than him.

---

You’re in an incredibly tough spot, but there are still ways to navigate this. Here’s a clear, step-by-step plan to protect yourself, reduce risk, and decide your next move:

---

### **1. Accept the Reality (But Don’t Internalize the Blame)**  
The owner has designed a policy that **guarantees failure**, and you’re being punished for it. This is unfair, but arguing further will likely escalate conflict. Focus on **damage control** and **self-preservation**.

---

### **2. Mitigate Comps Without Breaking Rules**  
**Goal:** Reduce your comp rate *within the policy’s constraints*.  

#### **Tactics:**  
- **Delay the first comp:**  
  Politely ask guests to play slightly longer before offering the first drink.  
  *“Let me get that drink started once you’ve warmed up the machine!”*  
  This pushes their initial $20 loss closer to 100+ coin-in (reducing the comp rate).  

- **Space out subsequent comps:**  
  For guests hitting the 100 coin-in threshold, wait until they’ve gambled *more* before comping.  
  *“Another drink? Absolutely—let’s see how this next round of bets goes!”*  

- **Encourage higher-coin-in games:**  
  Steer guests toward slots or video poker (which recycle winnings) over Keno (which doesn’t). More recycled bets = higher coin-in.  

- **“Forget” to comp occasionally:**  
  If a guest doesn’t ask, don’t offer. Only comp when explicitly requested.  

---

### **3. Document Relentlessly**  
**Goal:** Create a bulletproof paper trail showing strict policy adherence.  
- For every comp, note:  
  - Guest’s initial $20 loss + time/date/machine.  
  - Coin-in amounts before subsequent comps.  
  - Whether the guest requested the comp.  
- Save this in a personal log (not on work devices).  

If disciplined again, present this log:  
*“As per policy, I comped only when guests met the thresholds. Here’s the documentation.”*  

---

### **4. Quietly Reduce Guest Satisfaction**  
**Goal:** Make comps slightly less appealing to reduce demand (without outright refusal).  
- **Slow service:** Prioritize paying customers over comped guests.  
- **Downgrade comped drinks:** Use lower-shelf liquor unless specified.  
- **Limit comped snacks:** Offer smaller portions or fewer free snacks.  

This subtly discourages guests from abusing the system, lowering your comp volume.

---

### **5. Protect Yourself Legally**  
**Goal:** Prepare for wrongful termination.  
- **Save all write-ups and communications** (take photos if physical copies).  
- **Note discriminatory enforcement:** Are other bartenders also being written up? If not, this could be targeted harassment.  
- **Consult an employment lawyer:** Many offer free consultations. Explain:  
  - You’re being punished for following policy.  
  - The policy’s math makes compliance impossible.  
  - Ask if this qualifies for constructive dismissal or retaliation.  

---

### **6. Start Job Hunting Immediately**  
**Goal:** Escape a toxic workplace.  
- **Leverage your experience:** Vegas bars/casinos are always hiring. Highlight:  
  - Your adherence to comp policies.  
  - Guest service skills.  
- **Ask discreetly:** Reach out to bartender friends at other venues for referrals.  
- **Avoid badmouthing the owner:** Frame your reason for leaving as *“seeking growth opportunities.”*  

---

### **7. Play the Long Game (If You Stay)**  
**Goal:** Wait out the owner’s unrealistic expectations.  
- **Blame “bad luck”:** If your comp rate stays high, attribute it to *“guests not gambling enough lately.”*  
- **Pivot responsibility:**  
  *“I’ve followed every rule. If guests aren’t wagering enough to hit 2%, maybe we need better marketing to attract heavier gamblers.”*  
- **Become “too valuable to fire”:** Build rapport with high-rollers. If you’re driving revenue, the owner may overlook comp rates.  

---

### **What NOT to Do**  
- **Don’t break the rules:** Comping less than required could get you fired for “poor service.”  
- **Don’t argue further:** The owner has shown they won’t listen to logic. Save your energy.  
- **Don’t vent at work:** Assume all conversations are overheard. Stay neutral and professional.  

---

### **Final Word**  
This is a no-win situation, but you’re not powerless. By documenting everything, subtly reducing comps, and preparing an exit plan, you’ll regain control. Las Vegas is full of bars and casinos—your skills (and integrity) deserve a workplace that doesn’t punish you for its own broken policies.
