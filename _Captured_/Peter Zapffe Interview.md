# The Last Messiah

One night in times long since vanished, man awoke

and saw himself. He saw that he was naked under

the cosmos, homeless in his own body. Everything opened

up before his searching thoughts, wonder upon wonder,

terror upon terror, all blossomed in his mind.

Then woman awoke, too, and said that it was time to

go out and kill something. And man took up his bow, fruit

of the union between the soul and the hand, and went out

under the stars. But when the animals came to their water-

hole, where he out of habit waited for them, he no longer

knew the spring of the tiger in his blood, but a great psalm

to the brotherhood of suffering shared by all that lives.

That day he came home with empty hands, and when

they found him again by the rising of the new moon, he

sat dead by the waterhole.

What had happened? A break in the very unity

of life, a biological paradox, a monstrosity, an

absurdity, a hypertrophy of the most catastrophic kind.

Nature had aimed too high, and outdone itself. A spe-

cies had been too heavily armed—its genius made it

not only omnipotent over the outer world, but equally

dangerous for itself. Its weapon was like a sword with-

out hilt or cross guard, a two-edged blade that could

cleave through anything; but whoever used the sword

had to grip it by its blade and turn one of its edges

against himself.

In spite of its new eyes, mankind still had its roots

in base matter; its soul was woven into matter and sub-

ject to its blind laws. But at the same time man could

scrutinize matter as though it were a stranger; he could

compare himself with other phenomena, uncover and

categorize his own vital processes. He came to nature

as an unbidden guest; now in vain he extends his arms

and prays to be united with that which created him.

Nature no longer answers, it made a miracle with man

but has refused to acknowledge him since. Man has

lost his citizenship in the universe, he has eaten from

the tree of knowledge and has been banished from

paradise. He is powerful in his world, but he curses

his power because he has bought it with his soul’s har-

mony, his innocence, his comfort in life’s embrace.

He stands there with his visions, betrayed by the

universe, in bewilderment and angst. Animals, too,

know angst, under the roll of thunder and the claw of

the lion. But man feels angst for life itself—indeed, for

his own being. Life—for animals it is to feel the play

of forces, of rut and play and hunger, and at the last, to

bow before necessity. Suffering in an animal is limited

to itself; for men it builds itself up and spilled out into

angst for the world and for life.

From the moment the child embarks on his jour-

ney down the river of life, the roar of death’s water-

fall fills the valley, always nearer and nearer; it gnaws,

gnaws at the child’s happiness. Man looks out over the

earth, and it breathes like a great lung; when it exhales,

delicate and graceful life teems out of its pores, and

all the creatures stretch out their arms to the sun; but

when it takes in its breath, a rustle of fragile spirits

breaking sweeps through the multitudes, and their

corpses lash the ground like showers of hail. Nor did

man see only the number of his own days, but grave-

yards were exhumed to his view, and the cries of gro-

tesquely decomposed cadavers, the anguish of sunken

millennia, beat against him; motherhood’s dreams,

gone again to earth. The veil of the future was torn

aside, and it showed him a nightmare of endless repeti-

tions, a senseless squandering of organic stuff.

The suffering of humanity’s billions passes into

him through the gate of his empathy; every event

sneers at his demand for justice, the principle he holds

most dear. He sees his genesis in his mother’s womb,

he holds out his hand and sees that it has five branches.

Where does this accursed five come from, and what

does that have to do with his soul? He is no longer

simply at one with himself; in terror he touches his

body: this is you and you extend so far, and no farther.

He carries a meal inside himself, yesterday it was an

animal running freely about by its own will, now he is

absorbing it, making it a part of himself; where does he

begin and where does he end? Things blend into each

other in sequences of cause and effect, and everything

he tries to seize and hold dissolves before his probing

thoughts. Soon he sees mechanics behind everything,

even behind that which he used to hold dear, his be-

loved’s smile—there are other smiles, too, toes peeping

through a torn boot. At last the nature of things is only

his own nature, nothing exists but himself, every road

winds back to himself, the world is but a ghostly echo

of his own voice—he leaps up with a shriek and wants

to vomit himself onto the earth, together with his foul

meal, he feels insanity approaching, and tries to kill

himself before he loses the power to do even that.

But as he stands an instant away from death, he

sees the essence of death as well, and the cosmic sig-

nificance of the step he was about to take. His cre-

ative imagination shapes new, terrifying possibilities

behind death’s door and he understands that there is

no escape even in death. Now at last he can begin to

trace the outlines of his cosmic situation: he is the uni-

verse’s helpless prisoner, he is kept so that he can be

condemned to nameless possibilities.

From that moment on he finds himself in a state

of chronic panic. Such “cosmic panic” is basic to every

human mind. The species, in this light, seems predes-

tined to destruction, since any effort to preserve and

continue life is crippled when one’s undivided atten-

tion and energy is required to stave off the catastrophic

pressure of one’s inner being. That a species thus be-

comes unfit for life by reason of an overdevelopment

of a single faculty is a tragedy that has befallen not only

man. Some contend, for example, that a certain species

of deer once walked the earth but was rendered extinct

by a set of antlers that had become far too large. Mu-

tations, after all, are blind, thrown into life without a

thought to their viability in the environment.

When one is depressed and anxious, the human

mind is like such antlers, which in all their magnificent

glory, crush their bearer slowly to the ground.

Why, then, was the human race not wiped

out long ago in great, raging epidemics of

insanity? Why are there so few individuals who suc-

cumb to the pressure of life because their acuity reveals

to them more than they can bear?

A consideration of the spiritual history and present

state of our species suggests the following answer: most

people manage to save themselves by artificially paring

down their consciousness.

Had the great-antlered elk from time to time man-

aged to break off the outermost prongs of its magnifi-

cent headgear it might have trod the earth a bit longer.

In feverish, continual agony, true; but also in betrayal

of its essence, its central characteristic, for from the

hands of the creator it had received a commission to

be the horned standard bearer above all the beasts of

the field. What it won in continued existence it would

have lost in meaning, in existential pride; it would have

been a life without hope, a march not toward confir-

mation of its essence, but past confirmation’s ruins, a

self-destructive race against the sacred will of its blood.

The goal of life and life’s own annihilation is com-

mon to both the giant elk and the human race; it is

their tragic paradox. Faithful to its own essence, the

last Cervus giganticus bore the standard of its species

to the bitter end. Man saves himself, and continues.

Ironically, man’s survival is made possible by a more

or less conscious suppression of his hazardous surplus

of consciousness. This suppression is, for all intents

and purposes, continuous; it goes on as long as we are

awake and active, and becomes a condition for social

adjustment and what is popularly called “healthy” and

“normal” behavior.

III

Today’s psychiatry operates under the assumption

that this health and adjustment is the highest goal one

can aspire to. Depression, angst, a refusal to eat, and

so forth, are taken without exception to be marks of

a pathological condition, and are treated accordingly.

In many cases, however, these phenomena are indica-

tions of a deeper, more immediate experience of what

life is all about, bitter fruits of the genius of the mind

or emotion, which is at the root of every antibiological

tendency. It is not the soul that is ill, but its defense

mechanism that either fails or is abjured because it is

considered—correctly—as a betrayal of man’s most

potent gift.

All life before our eyes is, from its innermost depths

to its outermost rim, spun through and through with

a crisscrossing net of suppression mechanisms, and we

can trace their threads in the most trivial aspects of

daily life. These mechanisms are of an almost infinitely

colorful variety, but it seems justifiable to indicate at

any rate four main types, which naturally occur in all

manner of combinations: isolation, attachment, diver-

sion, and sublimation.

By isolation I mean a completely arbitrary rejection

of disturbing and destructive thoughts or feelings. Ful-

ly developed and in an almost brutal form, isolation

can be observed in doctors who, with an eye to their

own self-protection, see only the technical side of their

profession. It may also degenerate into pure vulgarity,

in ordinary thugs or medical students who try to ex-

orcise any sensitivity to life’s tragic sides with violence

(e.g., playing soccer with the heads of cadavers).

In our daily social life, isolation manifests itself

through universal, unwritten agreements to conceal

our existential condition from one another. This con-

cealment begins with children, in order to save them

from being rendered senseless by the life they have just

begun, to preserve their illusions until they are strong

enough to lose them. In return, children are forbid-

den to embarrass their parents by untimely allusions

to sex, shit, and death. Among adults there are rules

about “proper” behavior, and we see them quite plainly

when a man who cries in the streets is taken away by

the police.

The mechanism of attachment is also at work from

early childhood, where parents, home, and neighbor-

hood are taken for granted by the child, and give him a

sense of security. This embracing ring of secure experi-

ences are the first and perhaps most successful protec-

tion against “the cosmos” we come to know through-

out the rest of our lives, and in these experiences lies an

explanation of the much-discussed phenomenon “in-

fantile bonding.” Whether these bonds are also sexual

is immaterial in this light. When the child discovers in

later life that even these secure attachments are just as

accidental and fleeting as any other, he experiences a

crisis of bewilderment and anxiety, and quickly looks

for new attachments (for example, “Next fall I’m off to

college!”). If for some reason the new attachment does

not “take,” the crisis can either become life-threatening

or develop into what I call “attachment paralysis”: one

clings to one’s dead values, and tries to hide from one-

self and from others their inadequacy and one’s own

spiritual bankruptcy. The result is permanent insecu-

rity, feelings of inferiority, overcompensation, nervous-

ness. To the extent that the condition can be analyzed,

it becomes an object for psychoanalytical treatment,

through which one tries to make a successful transfer-

ral to new attachments.

Attachment can be seen as an attempt to establish

fixed points in, or a wall around, the shifting chaos of

consciousness. Usually this is an unconscious process,

but sometimes it is quite conscious, as for example in

an attempt to set some sort of goal for oneself, some

reason to live. Generally useful attachments are looked

upon with sympathy, and those who give their all for

their attachments (their company, or a project) are set

up as role models for the rest of us. These heroes have

managed to set up a strong bulwark against the disso-

lution of life, and others are supposed to profit by their

example. Even bon vivants, we say, settle down, get

married, and have children—the necessary walls are

built automatically. We build a certain necessity into

4 OpenAirPhilosophy.org | The Last Messiah

our lives, we welcome that which formerly might have

seemed an evil, only as a balm for our frayed nerves,

a high-walled container for a feeling for life that had

become slowly saturated with insecurity.

Every social unit is a large, rounded attachment

system, built on the solid beams of basic cultural ways

of thinking. The common man manages with these

shared cultural beams, his personality almost builds it-

self. Our personality has stopped developing, and rests

on inherited cultural foundations: God, the church,

the state, morality, destiny, the laws of life, the future.

The closer a norm lies to the bearing beams, the more

dangerous it is to disturb it. As a rule, those close-lying

norms are protected by laws and threats of punish-

ment—the Inquisition, censorship, conservative atti-

tudes, and so forth.

The strength of any one link in a chain of norms

depends either on our not seeing through its fictive

nature, or on everyone’s recognizing that it is a neces-

sary norm, even though we realize that it is a fiction.

An example is religious instruction in schools, which

is supported even by atheists because they see no other

way to compel children to act according to socially ac-

cepted norms.

As soon as the link’s illusory nature or needlessness

is perceived by someone, they quickly try to exchange

the old norms with newer (there is a saying, “Truths

have a limited life expectancy”)—and this is the cause

of all spiritual and cultural infighting, which, together

with economic competition, constitutes the dynamic

of world history.

The lust for material goods or power is not moti-

vated so much by the direct usefulness of wealth, since

nobody can sit on more than one chair at a time or eat

more than their fill. The real value of great wealth is

that the wealthy have at their disposal a much wider

variety of possible attachments or distractions.

For both individual and collective attachments,

a break in the norm chain

precipitates a crisis that is

ever more serious the closer

the break is to fundamental

social norms. In one’s inner

self, where one is protected

by outer walls, crises are en-

countered daily, but more

often minor frustrations than

life-threatening disasters.

Here one can still toy with

attachments, flouting them

with mild swearing, “social”

drinking, vulgar behavior,

and so on. But playing these

games can unwittingly dig

too deeply at a weak spot in

one’s protective walls and

break a hole through into the

yawning void. The situation

can change in the blink of an

eye from a lighthearted caper

Epilogue.

to a dance of death. The terror of existence stares us in

the face, and we realize with a staggering gasp that our

minds hang suspended by a web of their own making,

and that the abyss of hell gapes below.

The most basic beams supporting our culture can

only rarely be changed without causing a major social

spasm and a threat of total social dissolution, as dur-

ing a reformation or a revolution. At such times the

individual is thrown back upon his own resources, he

must develop his own attachments, and there are few

who can manage that. Depression, riotous living, and

suicide are the result—as was the case for German of-

ficers after the First World War.

Another weakness in the system is that one must

use very different defenses to confound the variety of

dangers on all fronts. Each of these bulwarks comes

with its own logical superstructure, and the unfortu-

nate result is that conflicts between incommensurable

sets of values inevitably arise. The superstructures col-

lide, and despair seeps in through the resulting cracks.

Then one can be possessed of a wanton destructiveness,

a lust to dismember the entire life-support system and,

in gleeful terror, try to sweep away the whole mess. The

terror is due to the loss of all comforting norms; the

glee comes from the resulting purposeless identifica-

tion and harmony with the deepest acknowledgment

of our being—its biological transience, its tendency

toward death.

We love our attachments because they save us; but

we hate them, too, because they hinder our sense of

freedom. So when we feel strong enough, it is a plea-

sure to come together and bury some anachronistic

value, to the funerary chime of church bells. Material

objects are useful as symbols, here, and these ceremo-

nies are sometimes called expressions of “radicalism.”

When someone has slain all the attachments he could

lay eyes on, he calls himself a “liberated” man.

Diversion is a third popular defense mechanism.

6 OpenAirPhilosophy.org | The Last Messiah

Skiing under the moon light.

With diversion we keep our field of vision within ac-

ceptable bounds by keeping it busy with a ceaseless

stream of new impressions. This is a typical dodge in

childhood; without diversions a child can’t stand him-

self—witness the common complaint, “Mom, there’s

nothing to do!” A little English girl I met while she was

visiting relatives in Norway used to come constantly in

from her room and ask, “What’s going on?” Babysit-

ters become virtuosos at diversion: “Look, child, see?

They’re painting the castle!” The phenomena is too

well known to require further illustration. Diversion is

the whole lifestyle of high society. It can be compared

to an airplane—built of the earth, but able, with self-

contained energy, to hold itself in the air as long as the

energy is maintained. It must always be moving for-

ward, because the air can only support it for an instant.

The pilot can become lazy and secure from habit, but

once the engine misfires, the crisis becomes acute.

Diversion tactics are often quite conscious. We

need to steadily divert our attention from ourselves,

because despair can lie just under the surface, in a catch

of breath or a sudden sob. When all possible diversions

are exhausted, we end up in a kind of “spleen” or pee-

vishness. This ranges from a mild sulk to a lethal de-

pression. Women, as a rule, seem to be more at peace

with their existential situation, and are more likely to

calm their anxieties through diversion.

In fact, a central aspect of punishment by impris-

onment is that most opportunities for diversion are

denied the prisoner. And, there being few other means

for protecting oneself against angst, prisoners are for

the most part constantly on the brink of utter despair.

Any measures he can find to stave off this despair are

justified as an attempt to preserve life itself; for the

moment he experiences his soul alone in the universe,

there is nothing else to see but the categorical impos-

sibility of existence.

Pure, unadulterated despair, “life-panic,” will prob-

ably never come to fullness, since defense mechanisms

are complex, automatic, and, to some extent, con-

stantly operating. But the no-man’s-land in proximity

to despair can also be a kind of death zone, and in

them life can continue only under great duress. Death

always offers a way out, despite the phantoms that are

supposed to lurk behind it; and since the way one feels

about death changes with the circumstances, it can

even come to seem a welcome escape from life in the

death zone. Some people manage, in fact, to build up

a “proper death”—ringing elegies, a glorious last stand,

the whole bit—as a final diversion, so there really can

be “fates worse than death.” Newspapers with their

gentle obituaries are in this case a mechanism for social

suppression (for a change), since they always manage

to find a soothing explanation for a death that was re-

ally due to despair; for example, “It is thought that the

deceased took his own life because of the sudden fall in

the price of wheat on the commodities market.”

When a man kills himself in despair, it is an en-

tirely natural death, resulting from spiritual causes.

The modern barbarity of trying to “save face” for the

deceased is, then, a horrible misunderstanding of the

nature of existence.

Few people can survive arbitrary, meaningless

changes in their situation, whether it be a change of

jobs, a change in the social life, or a change in the way

they relax. Most “spiritually developed” people demand

that these changes have a sort of continuity, direction,

or progression. For them, no situation can be ulti-

mately satisfying, they must always go a step further,

gathering new information, pursuing a career, and so

on. These people suffer from an ineradicable yearning

to overstep limits, to demand more and more from life,

a restless ambition that is never satisfied. When one’s

previous goal is reached, it becomes only a step to some

higher goal—the goal itself, in fact, is immaterial; it

is the yearning itself that is important. The absolute

height of one’s goal is less important than how much

higher it is from where one momentarily finds oneself;

it is the marginal degree of yearning that counts. The

promotion from private to corporal is often more im-

portant than from lieutenant to general. Accordingly,

this “law of marginally increasing demands” destroys

OpenAirPhilosophy.org | The Last Messiah 7

any hope that “progress” will be satisfying; there is no

end to progress. Human yearning, then, means not

just longing after something, but also longing to be

saved from something, wherever we are at the moment.

And if we use “save” or “salvation” in its religious sense,

it becomes clear that this is precisely what characterizes

the religious experience. Nobody has ever managed to

explain what it is they are longing after in religion, but

it is quite clear what they are trying to escape from –

this earthly vale of tears, one’s untenable existen-

tial situation. And if becoming aware of this situation

is the greatest truth our souls can reach, it is also clear

why religion is thought to be a fundamental need of

human beings. In light of the above, however, the hope

that there might be some ultimate confirmation for the

existence of God seems utterly in vain.

With the fourth defense mechanism, sublimation,

the mode of operation is transformation rather than

suppression: with creative talent or unshakable pa-

nache, one might be able to transform the very agonies

of life into pleasant experiences. One takes on the evils

of life with a positive attitude, which can then twist

them into useful experiences. It seizes, for example, on

their dramatic, heroic, lyric, or even comic aspects and

thus dissolves the terror in them.

Sublimation, though, only works so long as these

evils have already lost their most bitter sting, or if one

manages to sublimate them before despair sinks its

fingers firmly into one’s mind. Mountaineers, for ex-

ample, take no pleasure in gazing into the nauseating

abyss below them until they have reached a nice, solid

belay. Only then can they relish their exposed situa-

tion. Writers of tragedy are another example: to write

a tragedy one must first free oneself from—betray—

the essence of tragedy, so that one can look at it in a

calm, detached way, appreciating its aesthetic qualities.

In writing tragedy one has the luxury of being able

to dance from one situation to another and another,

steadily worse; there is really no end to the heights the

writer can reach; in a way it is quite embarrassing. The

author chases his ego through a countless variety of

desperate situations, watching with glee as the situa-

tion gets worse and worse, glorying (from a safe dis-

tance) in the power of consciousness to destroy itself.

This article, in fact, is a classic example of sublima-

tion. Despite his perilous subject, the present writer is not

suffering at all; he is merely filling pieces of paper with

words, and will probably get paid for the manuscript.

Is it possible for so-called “primitive” peoples

to manage life without all these philosophi-

cal spasms and gymnastics? Is it possible for them to live

in harmony with themselves in the undisturbed plea-

sures of work and love? If these beings are to be called

humans at all, I think the answer must be no. The most

one could say about these children of nature is that they

stand a bit nearer the beautiful biological ideal than we

urbanized folk. That we have managed to save ourselves

in spite of our harrowing existence is mostly due to

those sides of our nature that are hardly or appropriately

developed. Our heretofore successful defense, of course,

cannot create human life, only delay its extinction. Still,

our most positive traits are the proper use of our bodies’

strengths and the biologically useful part of our souls.

And these traits must operate under stringent condi-

tions—the limitations of our senses, the frailty of our

bodies, and the energy-demanding task of keeping our

bodies in one piece and our need for affection satisfied.

And it is just these conditions, the narrow range of

possibilities for happiness, that are so crassly flouted by

our modern, growing civilization, its technology, and

its standardization. And since a large part of our best

biological talents are superfluous in the modern, com-

plicated technological game we play with the environ-

ment, we are victims of increasing spiritual unemploy-

ment. The value of technological advances for human

life must therefore be evaluated according to their ability

to afford us increasing spiritual activity—without at the

same time destroying the nature that gives us the oppor-

tunity to practice these activities. The limits of proper

technological development are unclear, but I would ven-

ture that the earliest flint scrapers were a good discovery.

rience is evidenced by the mass flight to diversions: amusements, competitive sport, radio—“the rhythm of the times.” Attachments are in a bad way—all the inherited cultural attachments have been shot full of holes by criticism, and dread, anxiety, bewilderment, and despair pours in through these same holes. Communism and psychoanalysis, as different as they are in other respects, both try to construct new versions of the old defense mechanism: with violence and cunning, respectively, to make people useful by cutting down their surplus of insight into life’s precariousness.

Both of these methods are uncannily logical. But even these attempts will be, in the end, unsuccessful. A purposeful degeneration to a practically useful lower level of consciousness might save the race for a short time, but human nature being what it is, we would not find lasting peace in such a resignation, or in any resignation.

Every single other technological innovation has had more value to the inventor himself than to anyone else. They represent grand and ruthless larceny from the possibilities for others’ experiences, and should be punished with the most stringent penalties if they are made public against the better judgment of an institution established to evaluate them. One crime among many of this sort is the use of aircraft to map unknown areas. In one fell swoop the tremendously rich possibilities for others’ experiences are destroyed, experiences that could have been held in trust for the common interest, such that everyone could have had the joy of discovery after his own efforts.

The global fever of life is at the moment characterized by the continual impoverishment of the possibility of spiritually developing experiences. The absence of biologically natural possibilities for fulfilling expe-

| The Last Messiah

If we follow this train of thought through to

the bitter end, the conclusion is inescapable:

As long as humankind blunders along under the dire misconception that we are biologically preordained to conquer the earth, no alleviation of our angst for life is possible. As the number of people on the earth grows, the spiritual atmosphere will become tighter, and defense mechanisms will have to become ever more brutal.

And we will continue to dream of salvation, re-

demption, and a new Messiah. But after many saviors have been nailed to trees and stoned to death in the marketplace, then the last Messiah will appear.

A man will come forth, who before all other men has dared to strip his soul naked and give himself wholly over to our most profound questioning, even to the idea of annihilation. A man who has grasped life in its cosmic context, and whose agony is the agony of the world. But such a rising wail will assail him from all the people of the earth, crying for his thousand-fold execution, when his voice blankets the world like a shroud, and his peculiar message is heard for the first and last time:

The life on many worlds is like a rushing

river, but the life on this world is like a stagnant puddle and a backwater.

The mark of annihilation is written on thy

brow. How long will ye mill about on the edge?

But there is one victory and one crown, and one salvation and one answer:

Know thyselves; be unfruitful and let there

be peace on Earth after thy passing.

And when he has spoken these words, they will fall upon him, with midwives and wet nurses at their head, and they will bury him under their fingernails. He is the last Messiah. From father to son, from son after father, he is descended from the archer at the waterhole.
