## Prologue

 [Nicholas of Cusa] to his own venerable teacher, the divinely
 beloved and most reverend father, Lord Julian,1 most worthy
 cardinal of the holy Apostolic See.
 Your very great and indeed very proven Genius will rightly wonder
 what to make of the following fact: viz., that when, quite imprudent
ly, I endeavor to publish my foreigner's-foolishness, I select you as a
 judge. [You will wonder about my treating you] as if you retained
 some leisure (you, who by virtue of your cardinal's duties at the Holy
 See are extremely busy with especially important public affairs) and
 as if, given your most thorough knowledge of all the Latin writers who
 have hitherto become illustrious (and [your] recent [knowledge] of
 the Greek writers as well), you could be drawn by the novelty of its
 title to this presumably very foolish production of mine—I, whose
 quality of intellect has long been very well known to you. This won
dering shall, I hope, induce your knowledge-hungry mind to take a
 look. [You will wonder] not because you think that something previ
ously unknown might be presented here; rather, [you will marvel] at
 the boldness by which I was led to deal with learned ignorance. For
 the naturalists state that a certain unpleasant sensation in the opening
 of the stomach precedes the appetite in order that, having been stim
ulated in this way, the nature (which endeavors to preserve itself) will
 replenish itself. By comparison, I consider wondering (on whose ac
count there is philosophizing)2 to precede the desire-for-knowing in
 order that the intellect (whose understanding is its being) will perfect
 itself by the study of truth.3 Unusual things, even if they be monstrous,
 are accustomed to move us. For this reason, 0 unparalleled Teacher,
 deem, according to your kindness, that something worthwhile lies hid
den herein; and in regard to divine matters receive from a German a
 mode of reasoning such as the following—a mode which great labor
 has rendered very pleasing to me.
 Chapter One: How it is that knowing is not-knowing.
 We see that by the gift of God there is present in all things a natural
 4
5
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 1
 desire to exist in the best4 manner in which the condition of each
 thing's nature permits this. And [we see that all things] act toward this
 end and have instruments adapted thereto. They have an innate sense
 of judgment which serves the purpose of knowing. [They have this]
 in order that their desire not be in vain but be able to attain rest in
 that [respective] object which is desired by the propensity of each
 thing's own nature. But if perchance affairs turn out otherwise, this
 [outcome] must happen by accident-as when sickness misleads taste
 or an opinion misleads reason. Wherefore, we say that a sound, free
 intellect knows to be true that which is apprehended by its affection
ate embrace. (The intellect insatiably desires to attain unto the true
 through scrutinizing all things by means of its innate faculty of infer
ence.) Now, that from which no sound mind can withhold assent is,
 we have no doubt, most true. However, all those who make an inves
tigation judge the uncertain proportionally, by means of a comparison
 with what is taken to be certain.5
 3
 4
 Therefore, every inquiry is comparative and uses the means of
 comparative relation.6 Now, when, the things investigated are able to
 be compared by means of a close proportional tracing back to what
 is taken to be [certain], our judgment apprehends easily; but when we
 need many intermediate steps, difficulty arises and hard work is re
quired. These points are recognized in mathematics, where the earli
er propositions are quite easily traced back to the first and most evi
dent principles but where later propositions [are traced back] with
 more difficulty because [they are traced back] only through the me
diation of the earlier ones. Therefore, every inquiry proceeds by means
 of a comparative relation, whether an easy or a difficult one. Hence,
 the infinite, qua infinite, is unknown; for it escapes all comparative re
lation.7 But since comparative relation indicates an agreement in some
 one respect and, at the same time, indicates an otherness, it cannot be
 understood independently of number. Accordingly, number encom
passes all things related comparatively. Therefore, number, which is
 a necessary condition of comparative relation, is present not only in
 quantity but also in all things which in any manner whatsoever can
 agree or differ either substantially or accidentally. Perhaps for this rea
son Pythagoras deemed all things to be constituted and understood
 through the power of numbers.
 Both the precise combinations in corporeal things and the con
gruent relating of known to unknown surpass human reason-to such
6
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 1 - 2
 an extent that Socrates seemed to himself to know nothing except that
 he did not know. And the very wise Solomon maintained that all things
 are difficult and unexplainable in words.8 And a certain other man of
 divine spirit says that wisdom and the seat of understanding are hid
den from the eyes of all the living.9 Even the very profound Aristo
tle, in his First Philosophy, asserts that in things most obvious by na
ture such difficulty occurs for us as for a night owl which is trying to
 look at the sun.10 Therefore, if the foregoing points are true, then since
 the desire in us is not in vain, assuredly we desire to know that we
 do not know. If we can fully attain unto this [knowledge of our igno
rance], we will attain unto learned ignorance. For a man-even one very
 well versed in learning-will attain unto nothing more perfect than to
 be found to be most learned in the ignorance which is distinctively his.
 The more he knows that he is unknowing, the more learned he will be.
 Unto this end I have undertaken the task of writing a few things about
 learned ignorance.
 5

 Chapter Two: Preliminary clarification
 of what will follow.
 Since I am going to discuss the maximum learning of ignorance, I
 must deal with the nature of Maximality.11 Now, I give the name
 “Maximum” to that than which there cannot be anything greater. But
 fullness befits what is one. Thus, oneness—which is also being—co
incides with Maximality. But if such oneness is altogether free from
 all relation and contraction, obviously nothing is opposed to it, since
 it is Absolute Maximality. Thus, the Maximum is the Absolute One
 which is all things. And all things are in the Maximum (for it is the
 Maximum); and since nothing is opposed to it, the Minimum likewise
 coincides with it, and hence the Maximum is also in all things. And
 because it is absolute, it is, actually, every possible being; it contracts
 nothing from things, all of which [derive] from it. In the first book I
 shall strive to investigate incomprehensibly above human reason-this
 Maximum, which the faith of all nations indubitably believes to be
 God. [I shall investigate] with the guidance of Him “who alone dwells
 in inaccessible light.”12
 Secondly, just as Absolute Maximality is Absolute Being, through
 which all things are that which they are, so from Absolute Being there
 exists a universal oneness of being which is spoken of as “a maxi
mum deriving from the Absolute [Maximum]”—existing from it con
7
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 2 - 3
 tractedly and as a universe. This maximum's oneness is contracted in
 plurality, and it cannot exist without plurality. Indeed, in its universal
 oneness this maximum encompasses all things, so that all the things
 which derive from the Absolute [Maximum] are in this maximum and
 this maximum is in all [these] things. Nevertheless, it does not exist
 independently of the plurality in which it is present, for it does not
 exist without contraction, from which it cannot be freed. In the sec
ond book I will add a few points about this maximum, viz., the uni
verse.
 7
 8
 9
 Thirdly, a maximum of a third sort will thereafter be exhibited.
 For since the universe exists-in-plurality only contractedly, we shall
 seek among the many things the one maximum in which the universe
 actually exists most greatly and most perfectly as in its goal. Now,
 such [a maximum] is united with the Absolute [Maximum], which is
 the universal end; [it is united] because it is a most perfect goal, which
 surpasses our every capability. Hence, I shall add some points about
 this maximum, which is both contracted and absolute and which we
 name Jesus, blessed forever. [I shall add these points] according as
 Jesus Himself will provide inspiration.
 However, someone who desires to grasp the meaning must elevate
 his intellect above the import of the words rather than insisting upon
 the proper significations of words which cannot be properly adapted
 to such great intellectual mysteries. Moreover, it is necessary to use
 guiding illustrations in a transcendent way and to leave behind per
ceptible things, so that the reader may readily ascend unto simple in
tellectuality. I have endeavored, for the purpose of investigating this
 pathway, to explain [matters] to those of ordinary intelligence as clear
ly as I could. Avoiding all roughness of style,13 I show at the outset
 that learned ignorance has its basis in the fact that the precise truth is
 inapprehensible.14
 Chapter Three: The precise truth is incomprehensible.15
 It is self-evident that there is no comparative relation of the infinite
 to the finite.16 Therefore, it is most clear that where we find compar
ative degrees of greatness, we do not arrive at the unqualifiedly Max
imum; for things which are comparatively greater and lesser are finite;
 but, necessarily, such a Maximum is infinite. Therefore, if anything
 is posited which is not the unqualifiedly Maximum, it is evident that
8
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 3 - 4
 something greater can be posited. And since we find degrees of equal
ity (so that one thing is more equal to a second thing than to a third,
 in accordance with generic, specific, spatial, causal, and temporal
 agreement and difference among similar things), obviously we can
not find two or more things which are so similar and equal that they
 could not be progressively more similar ad infinitum.17 Hence, the
 measure and the measured—however equal they are—will always re
main different.18
 10
 11
 Therefore, it is not the case that by means of likenesses a finite in
tellect can precisely attain the truth about things. For truth is not some
thing more or something less but is something indivisible. Whatever
 is not truth cannot measure truth precisely. (By comparison, a non
circle [cannot measure] a circle, whose being is something indivisi
ble.) Hence, the intellect, which is not truth, never comprehends truth
 so precisely that truth cannot be comprehended infinitely more pre
cisely. For the intellect is to truth as [an inscribed] polygon is to [the
 inscribing] circle.19 The more angles the inscribed polygon has the
 more similar it is to the circle. However, even if the number of its an
gles is increased ad infinitum, the polygon never becomes equal [to
 the circle] unless it is resolved into an identity with the circle. Hence,
 regarding truth, it is evident that we do not know anything other than
 the following: viz., that we know truth not
 to be precisely comprehensible as it is. For truth may be likened unto
 the most absolute necessity (which cannot be either something more
 or something less than it is), and our intellect may be likened unto pos
sibility. Therefore, the quiddity of things,20 which is the truth of be
ings, is unattainable in its purity; though it is sought by all philoso
phers, it is found by no one as it is. And the more deeply we are in
structed in this ignorance, the closer we approach to truth.
 Chapter Four: The Absolute Maximum, with which
 the Minimum coincides, is understood
 incomprehensibly.
 Since the unqualifiedly and absolutely Maximum (than which there
 cannot be a greater) is greater than we can comprehend (because it is
 Infinite Truth), we attain unto it in no other way than incomprehensi
bly. For since it is not of the nature of those things which can be com
paratively greater and lesser, it is beyond all that we can conceive.
 For whatsoever things are apprehended by the senses, by reason, or by
9
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 4
 intellect differ both within themselves and in relation to one another—
 [differ] in such way that there is no precise equality among them.
 Therefore, Maximum Equality, which is neither other than21 nor dif
ferent from anything, surpasses all understanding. Hence, since the ab
solutely Maximum is all that which can be,22 it is altogether actual.
 And just as there cannot be a greater, so for the same reason there can
not be a lesser, since it is all that which can be. But the Minimum is
 that than which there cannot be a lesser. And since the Maximum is
 also such, it is evident that the Minimum coincides with the Maxi
mum.The foregoing [point] will become clearer to you if you contract
 maximum and minimum to quantity. For maximum quantity is maxi
mally large; and minimum quantity is maximally small. Therefore, if
 you free maximum and minimum from quantity—by mentally remov
ing large and small—you will see clearly that maximum and minimum
 coincide.23 For maximum is a superlative just as minimum is a su
perlative. Therefore, it is not the case that absolute quantity is maxi
mum quantity rather than minimum quantity; for in it the minimum
 is the maximum coincidingly.
 12
 Therefore, opposing features belong only to those things which
 can be comparatively greater and lesser; they befit these things in dif
ferent ways; [but they do] not at all [befit] the absolutely Maximum,
 since it is beyond all opposition. Therefore, because the absolutely
 Maximum is absolutely and actually all things which can be (and is
 so free of all opposition that the Minimum coincides with it), it is be
yond both all affirmation and all negation. And it is not, as well as is,
 all that which is conceived to be; and it is, as well as is not, all that
 which is conceived not to be. But it is a given thing in such way that
 it is all things; and it is all things in such way that it is no thing; and
 it is maximally a given thing in such way that it is it minimally. For
 example, to say “God, who is Absolute Maximality, is light” is [to say]
 no other than “God is maximally light in such way that He is mini
mally light.” For Absolute Maximality could not be actually all pos
sible things unless it were infinite and were the boundary of all things
 and were unable to be bounded by any of these things—as, by the
 graciousness of God, I will explain in subsequent sections. However,
 the [absolutely Maximum] transcends all our understanding. For our
 intellect cannot, by means of reasoning,24 combine contradictories in
 their Beginning, since we proceed by means of what nature makes ev
ident to us. Our reason falls far short of this infinite power and is un
able to connect contradictories, which are infinitely distant. Therefore,
10
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 4 - 5
 we see incomprehensibly, beyond all rational inference, that Absolute
 Maximality (to which nothing is opposed and with which the Mini
mum coincides) is infinite. But “maximum” and “minimum,” as used
 in this [first] book, are transcendent terms of absolute signification,
 so that in their absolute simplicity they encompass—beyond all con
traction to quantity of mass or quantity of power—all things.
 13
 Chapter Five: The Maximum is one.
 From these [considerations] it is most clearly evident that the ab
solutely Maximum is both incomprehensibly understandable and un
nameably nameable. (I will later present a fuller version of this doc
trine. )25 Anything than which a greater or a lesser cannot be posited
 cannot be named. For by the movement of our reason names are as
signed to things which, in terms of comparative relation, can be com
paratively greater or lesser. And since all things exist in the best way
 they are able to exist, there cannot be a plurality of beings indepen
dently of number. For if number is removed, the distinctness, order,
 comparative relation, and harmony of things cease; and the very plu
rality of beings ceases. But if number itself were infinite—in which
 case it would be actually maximal and the minimum would coincide
 with it—all of these would likewise cease, since to be infinite num
ber and to be minimally number [i.e., not at all to be number] amount
 to the same thing. Therefore, if in ascending the scale of numbers we
 actually arrive at a maximum number, since number is finite, still we
 do not come to a maximum number than which there can be no greater
 number; for such a number would be infinite. Therefore, it is evident
 that the ascending number-scale is actually finite,26 and that the [ar
rived at maximum number] would be in potentiality relative to another
 [greater] number. But if on the descending scale a similar thing held
 true of number, so that for any actually posited small number a small
er number were always positable by subtraction just as on the as
cending scale a larger number [is always positable] by addition, [then
 the outcome] would still be the same [as in the case where number
 were infinite]. For there would be no distinction of things; nor would
 any order or any plurality or any degrees of comparatively greater and
 lesser be found among numbers; indeed there would not be number.27
 Therefore, in numbering, it is necessary to come to a minimum
 than which there cannot be a lesser, viz., oneness. And since there can
not be anything lesser than oneness,28 oneness will be an unqualifiedly
11
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 5 - 6
 minimum, which, by virtue of the considerations just presented, coin
cides with the maximum.
 14
 15
 However, oneness cannot be number; for number, which can be
 comparatively greater, cannot at all be either an unqualifiedly mini
mum or an unqualifiedly maximum. Rather, oneness is the beginning
 of all number29 because it is the minimum; and it is the end of all num
ber, because it is the maximum. Therefore, [by comparison] Absolute
 Oneness, to which nothing is opposed, is Absolute Maximality, which
 is the Blessed God. Since this Oneness is maximal, it cannot be mul
tiple (for it is all that which can be). Therefore, it cannot become num
ber.
 See that by means of number we have been led to understanding
 (1) that “Absolute Oneness” quite closely befits the unnameable God
 and (2) that God is so one that He is, actually, everything which is 
possible. Accordingly, Absolute Oneness cannot be comparatively
 greater or lesser; nor can it be multiple, Thus, Deity is Infinite One
ness. Therefore, he who said “Hear, 0 Israel, your God is one”30 and
 “Your Father and Teacher in Heaven is one”31 could not have spo
ken more truly. And whoever would say that there are many gods
 would deny, most falsely, the existence not only of God but also of
 all the things of the universe—as will be shown in what follows. For
 the pluralities of things, which descend from Infinite Oneness, are re
lated to Infinite Oneness [in such way] that they cannot exist inde
pendently of it (just as number, which is an entity-of-reason produced
 by our [power of] relational discrimination, necessarily presupposes
 oneness as such a beginning of number that without this beginning
 there could not possibly be number). For how could they exist inde
pendently of being? Absolute Oneness is being, as we shall see later.
 32
 Chapter Six: The Maximum is Absolute Necessity.
 In the preceding33 I indicated that everything except the one unqual
ifiedly Maximum is—in contrast to it—limited and bounded. Now,
 what is finite and bounded has a beginning point and an end point.
 And we cannot make the following claim: viz., that “one given finite
 thing is greater than another given finite thing, [the series of finite
 things] always proceeding in this way unto infinity.” (For there can
not actually be an infinite progression of things which are compara
tively greater and lesser, since in that case the Maximum would be of
 the nature of finite things). Accordingly, it follows that the actually
12
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 6 - 7
 Maximum is the Beginning and the End of all finite things. Moreover,
 nothing could exist if the unqualifiedly Maximum did not exist. For
 since everything non-maximal is finite, it is also originated. But, nec
essarily, it will exist from another. Otherwise—i.e., if it existed from
 itself—it would have existed when it did not exist. Now, as is obvi
ously the rule, it is not possible to proceed to infinity in beginnings
 and causes. So it will be the case that the unqualifiedly Maximum ex
ists, without which nothing can exist.
 16
 17
 18
 Furthermore, let us contract maximum to being,34 and let us say:
 it is not the case that anything is opposed to maximum being; hence,
 neither not-being nor minimally being [are opposed to it]. How, then
since minimally being is maximally being-could we rightly think that
 the Maximum is able not to
 exist?35 Moreover, we cannot rightly think that something exists in the
 absence of being. But Absolute Being cannot be other than the ab
solutely Maximum. Hence, we cannot rightly think that something ex
ists in the absence of the [absolutely] Maximum. 
Moreover, the greatest truth is the absolutely Maximum. There
fore, (1) it is most greatly true either that the unqualifiedly Maximum
 exists or that it does not exist, or (2) [it is most greatly true that it]
 both exists and does not exist, or (3) [it is most greatly true that it] nei
ther exists nor does not exist. Now, no more [alternatives] can be ei
ther asserted or thought. No matter which one of them you say to be
 most greatly true, my point is made. For I have the greatest truth,
 which is the unqualifiedly Maximum.
 Wherefore, although it is evident through the aforesaid that the
 name “being” (or any other name) is not a precise name for the Max
imum (which is beyond every name),36 nevertheless it is necessary
 that being befit it maximally (but in a way not nameable by the name
 “maximum”) and above all nameable being.
 By such considerations, as well as by an infinity of similar ones,
 learned ignorance sees most clearly from the aforesaid that the un
qualifiedly Maximum exists necessarily, so that it is Absolute Neces
sity. But I indicated37 that the unqualifiedly Maximum cannot exist ex
cept as one. Therefore, it is most true that the Maximum exists as one.
 Chapter Seven: The trine and one Eternity.
 There has never been a nation which did not worship God and did not
13
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 7
 believe Him to be the absolutely Maximum. We find that Marcus
 Varro, in his book Antiquities noted that the Sissennii worshiped One
ness as the Maximum.38 But Pythagoras, a very famous man of un
deniable authority in his own time, taught that this Oneness is trine.39
 As we investigate the truth about this [matter] and elevate our intel
lects more highly, let us assert (in accordance with the aforesaid): No
 one doubts that that which precedes all otherness is eternal. For oth
erness is identical with mutability. Now, everything which naturally
 precedes mutability is immutable and, hence, eternal. But otherness
 consists of one thing and another. Hence, otherness is subsequent to
 oneness, just as is number. Therefore, oneness is by nature prior to oth
erness; and since oneness naturally precedes otherness, it is eternal.
 19
 20
 Moreover, every inequality is composed of an equal and a greater.
 Therefore, inequality is by nature subsequent to equality—something
 which can be proven very cogently by means of analysis. For every
 inequality is analyzable into an equality. For the equal is in between
 the greater and the lesser. So if you remove that [portion] which is
 greater, there will be an equal. But if there is a lesser, remove from
 the other that [portion] which is greater, and an equal will result. And
 you can continue to do this until, in the process of removing, you come
 to things simple.40 Clearly, then, every inequality is, by removing, an
alyzable into an equality. Therefore, equality naturally precedes in
equality.
 But inequality and otherness are by nature concomitant. For wher
ever there is inequality there is, necessarily, otherness—and con
versely. For between two things there will at least be otherness;41 now,
 the fact that they are two will mean that one of them is a duplicate;42
 therefore, there will be inequality.
 Hence, otherness and inequality will, by nature, be concomitant—
 especially since the number two is the first otherness and the first in
equality. Now, I have already proved that by nature equality precedes
 inequality. Hence, [it] also [precedes] otherness. Therefore, equality
 is eternal.
 Moreover, if there are two causes one of which is by nature prior
 to the other, the effect of the prior [cause] will be by nature prior to
 [the effect] of the subsequent [cause]. Now, oneness (unitas) is both
 union43 and a cause of union; for the reason things are said to be in
 union is that they are united (unita) together.44 Likewise, the number
 two is both separation and a cause of separation; for two is the first
14
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 7 - 8
 separation. Therefore, if oneness is a cause of union and if the num
ber two is [a cause] of separation, then just as oneness is by nature
 prior to two, so union is by nature prior to separation. But separation
 and otherness are by nature concomitant. Hence, union is eternal Oust
 as is oneness), since it is prior to otherness.
 21
 22
 23
 Thus, I have proved that oneness is eternal, equality eternal, and
 union also eternal. But there cannot be more than one eternal thing.
 For if there were more than one eternal thing, then since oneness pre
cedes all plurality, something [viz., oneness] would by nature be prior
 to eternity—an impossibility. Further
more, if there were more than one eternal thing, the one eternal thing
 would lack the other eternal things; and so, none of them would be
 perfect. Thus, something would be eternal which would not be eter
nal, because it would not be perfect. Since this is not possible, there
 cannot be more than one eternal thing. But since oneness is eternal,
 equality eternal, and union also eternal: oneness, equality, and union
 are one.45 And this is that trine Oneness which Pythagoras, the first
 philosopher of all and the glory of Italy and of Greece, affirmed to
 be worthy of worship.
 But let me add, still more explicitly, some further points about
 the generation of equality from oneness.
 Chapter Eight: Eternal generation.
 Let me now show very briefly that equality of oneness is begotten
 from oneness but that union proceeds from oneness and from equali
ty of oneness. “Unitas” is the equivalent of “on-tas,” so to speak (from
 the Greek word “on,” which is rendered in Latin as “ens”); and uni
tas [oneness] is entitas [being], as it were.
 For indeed, God is the being of things; for He is the Form of
 being46 and, hence, is also being. Now, equality of oneness is equal
ity of being, as it were (i.e., equality of existing (essendi sive exsis
tendi)). But equality of existing [i.e., of being] is the fact that in a thing
 there is neither too much nor too little—nothing beyond [measure],
 nothing below [measure]. For if in a thing there were present too
 much, [that thing] would be monstrous; and if there were present too
 little, [that thing] would not even exist.
 When we pay attention to what generation is, we view clearly the
 generation of equality from oneness. For generation is the repetition
15
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 8 - 9
 of oneness or the multiplication of the same nature as it proceeds from
 a father to a son. This latter generation is found only in transient
 things. However, the generation of oneness from oneness is one rep
etition of oneness—i.e., is oneness once [i.e., oneness times one]. But
 if I multiply oneness two times or three times, and so on, oneness will
 beget from itself another—e. g., the number two or the number three
 or some other number. But oneness once repeated [i.e., oneness times
 one] begets only equality of oneness; this [repeating] can only be un
derstood as oneness begetting oneness. And this generation is eternal.
 24
 25
 Chapter Nine: The eternal procession of union.
 Just as generation of oneness from oneness is one repetition of one
ness, so the procession from both is oneness of the repetition of this
 oneness—or (if you prefer the expression) is oneness of oneness and
 of the equality of this oneness. However, “procession” signifies an
 “extension,” as it were, from one thing to another-—just as in the case
 where two things are equal,47 a certain equality (which conjoins and
 unites them in a certain way) is extended, as it were, from the one to
 the other. Therefore, union is rightly said to proceed from oneness and
 from equality of oneness. For union is not merely of one [of these];
 rather it proceeds from oneness to equality of oneness48 and from
 equality of oneness to oneness. Therefore [union] is rightly said to pro
ceed from both, since it is extended, as it were, from the one to the
 other.
 But we do not say that union is begotten from oneness or from
 equality of oneness, since union is not from oneness either through
 repetition or through multiplication. And although equality of oneness
 is begotten from oneness and although union proceeds from both [of
 these], nevertheless oneness, equality of oneness, and the union pro
ceeding from both are one and the same thing—as if we were to speak
 of [one and] the same thing as this, it, the same.49 The fact of our
 saying “it” is related to a first thing; but our saying “the same” unites
 and conjoins the related thing to the first thing. Assume, then, that
 from the pronoun “it” there were formed the word “itness,” so that
 we could speak of oneness, itness, and sameness: itness would bear a
 relation to oneness, but sameness would designate the union of itness
 and oneness. [In this case, the names “Oneness,” “Itness,” and “Same
ness”] would nearly enough befit the Trinity.
16
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 9 - 10

 27
 As for our most holy teachers having called Oneness Father,
 Equality Son, and Union Holy Spirit: they have done so because of a
 certain likeness to these transient things.50 For in a father and a son
 there is a common nature which is one, so that with regard to this na
ture the son is equal to the father; for humanity is not present more
 greatly or less greatly in the son than in the father. And between a fa
ther and a son there is a certain union. For a natural love unites the
 one with the other, and does so because of the similarity of the same
 nature which is in them and which passes down from the father to the
 son. Wherefore, a father loves his son more than [he loves] someone
 else who agrees with him in humanity. Because of such a likeness—
 though it is a very remote likeness—Oneness is called Father, Equal
ity is called Son, and Union is called Love or Holy Spirit. [Yet they
 are given these names] only in relation to creatures, as I shall show
 more clearly hereafter,51 when the time comes. And, in my judgment,
 this is a very clear investigation (in accord with the Pythagorean in
vestigation) of the ever adorable Trinity in oneness and Oneness in
 trinity.
 Chapter Ten: An understanding of trinity in oneness
 transcends all things.
 Let us now inquire about what Martian is getting at when he says52
 that Philosophy, desiring to ascend unto a knowledge of this Trinity,
 left behind circles and spheres.
 In the preceding [passages] I have shown the sole and very sim
ple Maximum. And [I have shown]53 that [the following] are not this
 Maximum: the most perfect corporeal figure (viz., the sphere), the
 most perfect surface figure (viz., the circle), the most perfect rectilin
eal figure (viz., the triangle), the most perfect figure of simple straight
ness (viz., the line). Rather, the Maximum itself is beyond all these
 things. Consequently, we must leave behind the things which, togeth
er with their material associations, are attained through the senses,
 through the imagination, or through reason-[leave them behind] so that
 we may arrive at the most simple and most abstract understanding,54
 where all things are one, where a line is a triangle, a circle, and a
 sphere, where oneness is threeness (and conversely), where accident
 is substance, where body is mind (spiritus), where motion is rest, and
 other such things. Now, there is understanding when (1) anything
 whatsoever in the One is understood to be the One, and the One [is un
17
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 10
 derstood to be] all things, and, consequently, (2) anything whatsoever
 in the One [is understood to be] all things. And you have not rightly
 left behind the sphere, the circle, and the like, unless you understand
 that maximal Oneness is necessarily, trine—since maximal Oneness
 cannot at all be rightly understood unless it is understood to be trine.
 28
 29
 To use examples suitable to the foregoing [point]: We see that
 oneness of understanding is not anything other than that which un
derstands, that which is understandable, and the act of understanding.
 So suppose you want to transfer your reflection from that which un
derstands to the Maximum and to say that the Maximum is, most
 greatly, that which understands; but suppose you do not add that the
 Maximum is also, most greatly, that which is understandable,55 to
gether with being the greatest actual understanding. In that case, you
 do not rightly conceive of the greatest and most perfect Oneness. For
 if Oneness is the greatest and most perfect understanding (which with
out these three mutual relations cannot be either understanding or the
 most perfect understanding), then whoever does not attain to the trin
ity of this Oneness does not rightly conceive of oneness. For oneness
 is only threeness, since oneness indicates indivision, distinctness, and
 union. Indeed, indivision is from oneness—as are also distinctness and
 union (unio sive conexio). Hence, the greatest Oneness is not other
 than indivision, distinctness, and union. Since it is indivision, it is
 eternity and without beginning. (The eternal is not divided by any
thing.) Since it is distinctness, it is from immutable eternity. And since
 it is union (conexio sive unio), it proceeds from both [indivision and
 distinctness].
 Moreover, when I say “Oneness is maximal,” I indicate threeness.
 For when I say “oneness,” I indicate a beginning without a beginning;
 when I say “maximal,” I indicate a beginning from a beginning; when
 I conjoin and unite these two through the word “is,” I indicate a pro
cession from both. Therefore, if from earlier56 [considerations] I have
 proven very clearly that the One is maximal: since the Minimum, the
 Maximum, and their Union are one (so that Oneness is minimal One
ness, maximal Oneness, and their Union), then it is evident that Phi
losophy (which endeavors to comprehend, by a very simple under
standing, that the maximal Oneness is only trine) must leave behind
 all things imaginable and rational.57 However, you are wondering
 about what I said: viz., that if anyone desires to apprehend the Max
imum by means of a simple understanding, he must pass beyond the
18
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 10 - 11
 differences and varieties of things and beyond all mathematical fig
ures. (For I said that in the Maximum a line is a surface, a circle, and
 a sphere. )58 Hence, so that your understanding may be sharpened, I
 will try to convey you more readily, and by sure guidance, toward see
ing these necessary and very true points. They will suitably lead you
 (provided you rise from the sign upward to the truth, by understand
ing [the meaning of] words symbolically) unto wondrous delight. For
 you will proceed on this pathway by means of learned ignorance, so
 that you will be able to see (to the extent granted to an ardent [seek
er who is] elevated in accordance with the powers of human intelli
gence)59 the one and incomprehensible Maximum, the ever-blessed
 one and trine God.
 30
 31
 Chapter Eleven: Mathematics assists us very greatly in
 apprehending various divine [truths].
 All our wisest and most divine teachers agree that visible things are
 truly images of invisible things and that from created things the Cre
ator can be knowably seen as in a mirror and a symbolism.60 But the
 fact that spiritual matters (which are unattainable by us in themselves)
 are investigated symbolically has its basis in what was said earlier.
 For all things have a certain comparative relation to one another ([a
 relation which is], nonetheless, hidden from us and incomprehensible
 to us), so that from out of all things there arises one universe and in
 [this] one maximum all things are this one. And although every image
 seems to be like its exemplar, nevertheless except for the Maximal
 Image (which is, in oneness of nature, the very thing which its Ex
emplar is) no image is so similar or equal to its exemplar that it can
not be infinitely more similar and equal. (These [doctrines] have al
ready been made known from the preceding [remarks]).61
 Now, when we conduct an inquiry on the basis of an image, it is
 necessary that there be no doubt regarding the image, by means of
 whose symbolical comparative relation we are investigating what is
 unknown. For the pathway to the uncertain can be only through what
 is presupposed and certain.62 But all perceptible things are in a state
 of continual instability because of the material possibility abounding
 in them. In our considering of objects, we see that those which are
 more abstract than perceptible things,63 viz., mathematicals, (not that
 they are altogether free of material associations, without which they
 cannot be imagined, and not that they are at all subject to the possi
19
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 11
 bility of changing) are very fixed and are very certain to us. Therefore,
 in mathematicals the wise wisely sought illustrations of things that
 were to be searched out by the intellect.64 And none of the ancients
 who are esteemed as great approached difficult matters by any other
 likeness than mathematics. Thus, Boethius,65 the most learned of the
 Romans, affirmed that anyone who altogether lacked skill in mathe
matics could not attain a knowledge of divine matters.
 32
 33
 Did not Pythagoras, the first philosopher both in name and in fact,
 consider all investigation of truth to be by means of numbers? The Pla
tonists and also our leading [thinkers] followed him to such an extent
 that our Augustine,66 and after him Boethius,67 affirmed that, as
suredly, in the mind of the Creator number was the principal exem
plar of the things to be created. How was Aristotle68 (who by refut
ing his predecessors wanted to appear as someone without parallel)
 able in the Metaphysics to teach us about the difference of species oth
erwise than by comparing the species to numbers? And when, re
garding natural forms, he wanted to teach how the one form is in the
 other, he resorted of necessity to mathematical forms, saying: “Just
 as a triangle is in a quadrangle, so the lower [form] is in the higher
 [form].”69 I will not mention innumerable other similar examples of
 his. Also, when the Platonist Aurelius Augustine70 made an investi
gation regarding the quantity of the soul and its immortality, and re
garding other very deep matters, he had recourse to mathematics as
 an aid. This pathway seemed to please our Boethius71 to such an ex
tent that he repeatedly asserted that every true doctrine is contained
 in [the notions of] multitude and magnitude. And to speak more con
cisely, if you wish: was not the opinion of the Epicureans about atoms
 and the void-—an opinion which] denies God and is at variance with
 all truth—destroyed by the Pythagoreans and the Peripatetics only
 through mathematical demonstration?72 [I mean the demonstration]
 that the existence of indivisible and simple atoms—something which
 Epicurus took as his starting point—is not possible.
 Proceeding on this pathway of the ancients, I concur with them
 and say that since the pathway for approaching divine matters is
 opened to us only through symbols, we can make quite suitable use
 of mathematical signs because of their incorruptible certainty.
 Chapter Twelve: The way in which mathematical
 signs signs ought to be used
 in our undertaking.
20
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 12 - 13
 But since from the preceding [points] it is evident that the unquali
fiedly Maximum cannot be any of the things which we either know
 or conceive: when we set out to investigate the Maximum symboli
cally, we must leap beyond simple likeness. For since all mathemati
cals are finite and otherwise could not even be imagined: if we want
 to use finite things as a way for ascending to the unqualifiedly Max
imum, we must first consider finite mathematical figures together with
 their characteristics and relations. Next, [we must] apply these rela
tions, in a transformed way, to corresponding infinite mathematical
 figures. Thirdly, [we must] thereafter in a still more highly transformed
 way, apply the relations of these infinite figures to the simple Infinite,
 which is altogether independent even of all figure. At this point our ig
norance will be taught incomprehensibly how we are to think more
 correctly and truly about the Most High as we grope by means of a
 symbolism.
 34
 35
 Operating in this way, then, and beginning under the guidance of
 the maximum Truth, I affirm what the holy men and the most exalt
ed intellects who applied themselves to figures have stated in various
 ways. The most devout Anselm73 compared the maximum Truth to
 infinite rectitude. (Let me, following him, have recourse to the figure
 of rectitude, which I picture as a straight line.) Others who are very
 talented compared, to the Super-blessed Trinity, a triangle consisting
 of three equal right angles.74 Since, necessarily, such a triangle has
 infinite sides, as will be shown, it can be called an infinite triangle.
 (These men I will also follow.) Others who have attempted to befig
ure infinite oneness have spoken of God as an infinite circle. 75 But
 those who considered the most actual existence of God affirmed that
 He is an infinite sphere, as it were.76 I will show that all of these [men]
 have rightly conceived of the Maximum and that the opinion of them
 all is a single opinion.
 Chapter Thirteen: The characteristics of a
 maximum, infinite line.
 I maintain, therefore, that if there were an infinite line, it would be a
 straight line, a triangle, a circle, and a sphere. And likewise if there
 were an infinite sphere, it would be a circle, a triangle, and a line.
 And the same thing must be said about an infinite triangle and an in
finite circle.
 First of all, it is evident that an infinite line would be a straight
21
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 13
 line: The diameter of a circle is a straight line, and the circumference
 is a curved line which is greater than the diameter. So if the curved
 line becomes less curved in proportion to the increased circumference
 of the circle, then the circumference of the maximum circle, which
 cannot be greater, is minimally curved and there
fore maximally straight. Hence, the minimum co
incides with the maximum—to such an extent that
 we can visually recognize that it is necessary for
 the maximum line to be maximally straight and
 minimally curved. Not even a scruple of doubt
 about this can remain when we see in the figure
 here at the side that arc CD of the larger circle is
 less curved than arc EF of the smaller circle, and
 that arc EF is less curved than arc GH of the still
 smaller circle. Hence, the straight line AB will be
 the arc of the maximum circle, which cannot be
 greater. And thus we see that a maximum, infinite
 line is, necessarily, the straightest; and to it no
 curvature is opposed. Indeed, in the maximum line curvature is
 straightness. And this is the first  thing [which was] to be proved.

 Secondly, I said that an infinite line is a maximum triangle, a
 maximum circle, and a [maximum] sphere. In order to demonstrate
 this, we must in the case of finite lines see what is present in the po
tency of a finite line. And that which we are examining will become
 clearer to us on the basis of the fact that an infinite line is, actually,
 whatever is present in the potency of a finite line. To begin with, we
 know that a line finite in length can be longer and straighter; and I
 have just proved that the maximum line is the longest and straight
est. Next, if while point A remains fixed, line AB is rotated until B
 comes to C, a triangle is formed. And if the rotation is continued until
 B
 C
 A
 D
 D
 A
 B
22
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 13 - 14
 B returns to where it began, a circle is formed. Furthermore, if, while
 A remains fixed, B is rotated until it comes to the place opposite to
 where it began, viz., to D, then from lines AB and AD one continu
ous line is produced and a semicircle is described. And if while the
 diameter BD remains fixed the semicircle is rotated, a sphere is
 formed.77 And the sphere is the termination of the potency of the line.
 The sphere exists in complete actuality since it is not in potency with
 respect to any further derivable figure. Therefore, if these figures are
 present in the potency of a finite line and if an infinite line is actual
ly all the things with respect to which a finite line is in potency, then
 it follows that an infinite line is a triangle, a circle, and a sphere.
 Q.E.D.
 And because, presumably, you would like to see more clearly how
 it is that the infinite is actually those things which are present in the
 potency of the finite, I will now make you very certain thereof.
 37
 Chapter Fourteen: An infinite line is a triangle.
 Since in the case of quantitative things a line and a triangle differ in
comparably, the imagination, which does not transcend the genus of
 perceptible things, does not apprehend that the former can be the lat
ter. However, this [apprehending] will be easy for the intellect. It is
 already evident78 that there can be only one maximum and infinite
 thing. Moreover, since any two sides of any triangle cannot, if con
joined, be shorter than the third: it is evident that in the case of a tri
angle whose one side is infinite, the other two sides are not shorter
 [i.e., are together infinite]. And because each part of what is infinite
 is infinite: for any triangle whose one side is infinite, the other sides
 must also be infinite. And since there cannot be more than one infi
nite thing, you understand transcendently that an infinite triangle can
not be composed of a plurality of lines, even though it is the greatest
 and truest triangle, incomposite and most simple. And because it is the
 truest triangle—something which it cannot be without three lines—it
 will be necessary that the one infinite line be three lines and that the
 three lines be one most simple line. And similarly regarding the an
gles; for there will be only one infinite angle; and this angle is three
 angles, and the three angles are one angle. Nor will this maximum tri
angle be composed of sides and angles; rather, the infinite line and
 the [infinite] angle are one and the same thing, so that the line is the
 angle, because the triangle is the line.
23
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 14 - 15
 38
 39
 40
 Furthermore, you can be helped to understand the foregoing if you
 ascend from a quantitative triangle to a non-quantitative triangle.
 Clearly, every quantitative triangle has three angles equal to two right
 angles. And so, the larger the one angle is, the smaller are the other
 two. Now, any one angle can be increased almost but (in accordance
 with our first premise) not completely up to the size of two right an
gles. Nevertheless, let us hypothesize that it is increased completely
 up to the size of two right angles while the triangle remains [nonethe
less a triangle]. In that case, it will be obvious that the triangle has
 one angle which is three angles and that the three angles are one.
 In like manner, you can see that a triangle is a line. For any two
 sides of a quantitative triangle are, if conjoined, as much longer than
 the third side as the angle which they form is smaller than two right
 angles. For example, because the angle BAC is
 much smaller than two right angles, the lines BA
 and AC, if conjoined, are much longer than BC.
 Hence, the larger the angle, e.g., BDC, the less the
 lines BD and DC exceed the line BC, and the
 smaller is the surface. Therefore, if, by hypothesis,
 an angle could be two right angles, the whole tri
angle would be resolved into a simple line.
 Hence, by means of this hypothesis, which
 cannot hold true for quantitative things, you can be
 helped in ascending to non-quantitative things; that
 which is impossible for quantitative things, you see
 to be altogether necessary for non-quantitative
 things. Hereby it is evident that an infinite line is
 a maximum triangle. Q. E. D.
 Chapter Fifteen: The maximum triangle is a circle
 and a sphere.
 A
 D
 B C
 Next, we shall see more clearly that a triangle is a circle. Let us pos
tulate the triangle ABC, formed by rotating the line AB—A remain
ing stationary—until B comes to C. There is no doubt that if line AB
 were infinite and B were rotated until it came all the way back to the
 starting point, a maximum circle would be formed, of which BC
 would be a portion. Now, because BC is a portion of an infinite arc,
 BC is a straight line.79 And since every part of what is infinite is in
finite, BC is not shorter than the whole arc of infinite circumference.
24
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 15 - 16
 Hence, BC will be not only a portion
 but the most complete circumference.
 Therefore, it is necessary that the tri
angle ABC be a maximum circle. And
 because the circumference BC is a
 straight line, it is not greater than the
 infinite line AB;80 for there is nothing
 greater than what is infinite. Nor are
 there two lines, because there cannot
 be two infinite things. Therefore, the
 infinite line, which is a triangle, is also
 a circle. And [this is] what was pro
posed [for proof].
 41
 B C
 A
 Moreover, that an infinite line is a sphere becomes very obvious
 in the following way: The line AB is the circumference of the maxi
mum circle—indeed, it is the [maximum] circle, as was just proved.81
 And, in the triangle ABC, AB was brought from B to C, as was pre
viously stated. But BC is an infinite line, as was also just proved.
 Hence, AB [which is the maximum circle]
 reached C by a complete coming around upon itself.82 And since this
 is the case, it follows of necessity that from such a coming around of
 a circle upon itself a sphere is originated. And given that we previ
ously proved that ABC is a circle, a triangle, and a line, we have now
 proved that it is also a sphere. And
 these are [the results] we set out to find.
 42
 Chapter Sixteen: In a symbolic way the Maximum
 is to all things as a maximum
 line is to [all] lines.
 Now that we have seen how it is that an infinite line is actually and
 infinitely all that which is in the possibility of a finite line: we like
wise have a symbolism for seeing how it is that, in the case of the sim
ple Maximum, this Maximum is actually and maximally all that which
 is in the possibility of Absolute Simplicity. For whatever is possible,
 this the Maximum is actually and maximally. [I do] not [mean] that
 it is from what is possible but rather that it is [what-is-possible] max
imally. By comparison, a triangle is educed from a line; but an infi
nite line, [though a triangle], is not a triangle as [a triangle] is educed
 from a finite [line]; rather, [the infinite line] is actually an infinite tri
25
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 16
 angle, which is identical with the [infinite] line. Moreover, absolute
 possibility is, in the Maximum, not other than actually the Maxi
mum—just as an infinite line is actually a sphere. The situation is oth
erwise in the case of what is non-maximum. For in that case the pos
sibility is not the actuality—even as a finite line is not a triangle.
 43
 44
 45
 Hence, we notice here an important speculative consideration
 which, from the foregoing, can be inferred about the Maximum: viz.,
 that the Maximum is such that in it the Minimum is the Maximum,
 and thus the Maximum infinitely and in every respect transcends all
 opposition. From this principle there can be elicited about the Maxi
mum as many negative truths as can be written or read; indeed, all
 humanly apprehensible theology is elicited from this very great prin
ciple. Accordingly, the greatest seeker of God, Dionysius the Are
opagite,83 declares in his Mystical Theology that most blessed
 Bartholomew marvelously understood theology, having called it the
 greatest and the least. For whoever understands this [point] under
stands all things; he transcends all created understanding. For God,
 who is this Maximum, “is not  thing and is not any other thing; He
 is not here and is not there,” as the same Dionysius says regarding
 the divine names; for just as He is all things, so He is not any of all
 the things.84 For, as Dionysius concludes at the end of The Mystical
 Theology: “above all affirmation God is the perfect and unique Cause
 of all things; and the excellence of Him who is unqualifiedly free from
 all things and is beyond all things is above the negation of all
 things.”85 Hence, he concludes in his Letter to Gaius that God is
 known above every mind and all intelligence.86
 And in harmony with this [verdict] Rabbi Solomon states that all
 the wise agreed that the sciences do not apprehend the Creator. Only
 He Himself apprehends what He is; our apprehension of Him is a de
fective approximation of His apprehension.87 Accordingly, Rabbi
 Solomon elsewhere says by way of conclusion: “Praised be the Cre
ator! When His existence (essentia) is apprehended, the inquiry of the
 sciences is cut short, wisdom is reckoned as ignorance, and elegance
 of words as fatuity.” And this is that learned ignorance which we are
 investigating. Dionysius [himself] endeavored to show in many ways
 that God can be found only through learned ignorance—[found] by
 no other principle, it seems to me, than the aforesaid.
 Therefore, let our speculative consideration (which we elicit from
 the fact that infinite curvature is infinite straightness) be applied sym
26
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 16 - 17
 bolically to the Maximum as regards the Maximum's most simple and
 most infinite Essence: [We see] (1) that this Essence is the most sim
ple Essence of all essences; (2a) that in this Essence all the essences
 of past, present, and future things are—ever and eternally—actually
 this Essence; and so, [it is] all essences, even as it is the Essence of
 all [essences]; (2b) that the Essence of all [essences] is each essence
 in such way that it is all of them together and none of them in par
ticular; (3) that as an infinite line is the most congruent measure of
 all lines, so the Maximum Essence is likewise the most congruent
 measure of all essences. For, necessarily, the Maximum, to which the
 Minimum is not opposed, is the most congruent measure of all things;
 [it is] not a greater [measure than anything], because it is the Mini
mum; nor [is it] a lesser [measure than anything], because it is the
 Maximum. But everything measurable falls between the maximum
 and the minimum. Therefore, the Infinite Essence is the most con
gruent and most precise measure of all essences.88
 46
 47
 Furthermore, so that you may see this [point] more clearly, con
sider [the following]: If an infinite line were constituted by an infi
nite number of one-foot sections and if another infinite line were con
stituted by an infinite number of two-foot sections, these lines would
 nevertheless have to be equal, since the
 infinite is not greater than the infinite. Therefore, just as in an infi
nite line one foot is not shorter than two feet, so it is not the case that
 an infinite line exceeds the length of one foot more than it exceeds
 the length of two feet. Rather, since any part of the infinite is infinite,
 one foot of an infinite line is convertible with the whole infinite line,
 just as are two feet. Similarly, since in the Maximum Essence every
 essence is the Maximum Essence, the Maximum is none other than the
 most congruent measure of all essences. Nor is there found to be any
 other precise measure of every essence than that Essence; for all oth
ers fall short and can be more precise, as was shown very clearly ear
lier.89
 Chapter Seventeen: Very deep doctrines from the
 same [symbolism of an infinite line].
 Still more on the same topic: A finite line is divisible, and an infinite
 line is indivisible; for the infinite, in which the maximum coincides
 with the minimum, has no parts. However, a finite line is not divisi
ble to the point that it is no longer a line, because in the case of mag
27
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 17
 nitude we do not arrive at a minimum than which there cannot be a
 lesser-as was indicated earlier.90 Hence, a finite line is indivisible in
 its essence [ratio]; a line of one foot is not less a line than is a line
 of one cubit. It follows, then, that an infinite line is the essence of a
 finite line. Similarly, the unqualifiedly Maximum is the Essence of all
 things. But the essence is the measure. Hence, Aristotle9l rightly says
 in the Metaphysics that the First is the measure [metrum et mensura]
 of all things because it is the Essence of all things.
 48
 49
 Furthermore: Just as an infinite line, which is the essence of a fi
nite line, is indivisible and hence immutable and eternal, so also the
 Essence of all things, viz., Blessed God, is eternal and immutable. And
 herein is disclosed an understanding of the great Dionysius, who says
 that the Essence [essentia] of things is incorruptible,92 and of others
 who have said that the Essence [ratio] of things is eternal. For exam
ple, [let me mention] the divine Plato, who, as Chalcidius reports,93
 stated in the Phaedo that, as it exists in itself, there is one Form or
 Idea of all things but [that] with respect to things, which are plural,
 there seems to be a plurality of forms. For example, when I consider
 a two-foot line, a three-foot line, and so on, two things appear: (1)
 the line's essence, which is one and equal in each and every line and
 (2) the difference which there is between a line of two feet and a line
 of three feet. And so, the essence of a two-foot line and the essence
 of a three-foot line seem to be different. However, it is obvious that
 in an infinite line a line of two feet and a line of three feet do not dif
fer. Now, an infinite line is the essence of a finite line. Hence, there
 is one essence of both lines; and the difference between the things, or
 the lines, does not result from a difference of the essence, which is
 one, but results accidentally, because the lines do not participate equal
ly in the essence. Hence, there is only one essence of all lines, and it
 is participated in in different ways.
 But as for there being differences of participation: this occurs be
cause (as we proved earlier)94 there cannot be two things which are ex
actly similar and which, consequently, participate precisely and equal
ly in one essence. For only the Maximum, which is Infinite Essence,
 can participate with supreme equality in essence.95 Just as there is only
 one Maximum Oneness, so there can be only one Equality of Oneness.
 Because it is MaximumEquality,it is the Essence ofall things. By com
parison, there is only one infinite line, which is the essence of all finite
 lines; and because of the fact that a finite line necessarily falls short of
28
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 17
 aninfinite line, it cannot betheessenceofitself,evenasitcannotbeboth
 finite and infinite. Hence, just as no two finite lines can be precisely
 equal (since only the Maximum is precise Equality, which is Maximum
 Equality), so also there are not found to be two lines which participate
 equally in the one essence of all [lines].
 50
 51
 Moreover, in a line of two feet an infinite line is neither longer
 nor shorter than the two-foot line, as was stated earlier.96 And sim
ilarly regarding lines of three feet and more. Now, since an infinite
 line is indivisible and one, it is present as a whole in each finite line.
 But it is not present as a whole in each finite line according to par
ticipation and limitation; otherwise, when it was present as a whole
 in a line of two feet, it could not be present in a line of three feet,
 since a line of two feet is not a line of three feet. Therefore, it is pre
sent as a whole in each line in such way that it is not present in any
 line insofar as one line is distinct from the others through limitation.
 Therefore, the infinite line is present as a whole in each line in such
 way that each line is present in it. Now, this [point] must be consid
ered in both its aspects; for then we will see clearly how it is that
 the Maximum is in each thing and in no thing. This [symbolism of
 a line] symbolizes none other than the Maximum, since by similar
 reasoning the Maximum is [seen to be] in each thing, even as each
 thing [is seen to be] in it; moreover, [this symbolism] displays the rea
son that the Maximum exists in itself. Accordingly, the fact that the
 Maximum is the measure [metrum et mensura] of all things is not
 other than the fact that the unqualifiedly Maximum exists in itself—
 i.e., that the Maximum is the Maximum. Therefore, no thing exists
 in itself except the Maximum; and everything exists in itself insofar
 as it exists in its Essence [ratio], because its Essence (ratio) is the
 Maximum.
 From these [considerations] the intellect can be helped; and by the
 illustration of an infinite line, the intellect can in sacred ignorance very
 greatly advance beyond all understanding and toward the unqualifiedly
 Maximum. For here we have now seen clearly how we can arrive at
 God through removing the participation of beings. For all beings par
ticipate in Being. Therefore, if from all beings participation is re
moved, there remains most simple Being itself, which is the Essence
 (essentia) of all things. And we see such Being only in most learned
 ignorance; for when I remove from my mind all the things which par
ticipate in Being, it seems that nothing remains. Hence, the great
29
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 17 - 18
 Dionysius says97 that our understanding of God draws near to noth
ing rather than to something. But sacred ignorance teaches me that that
 which seems to the intellect to be nothing is the incomprehensible
 Maximum.
 52
 53
 Chapter Eighteen: From the same [symbolism]
 we are led to an understanding
 of the participation in being.
 Furthermore, our insatiable intellect, stimulated by the aforesaid, care
fully and with very great delight inquires into how it can behold more
 clearly this participation in the one Maximum. And being once again
 aided by the illustration of an infinite straight line, it remarks: A curve,
 which admits of more or less, cannot be a maximum or a minimum.
 Nor is a curve, qua curve,
 anything—since it is a deficiency of what is straight. Therefore, the
 being which is in a curve derives from participation in straightness,
 since a curve, considered maximally and minimally, is only something
 straight. Therefore, the less a curve is a curve (e.g., the circumference
 of a quite large circle), the more it participates in straightness. [I do]
 not [mean] that it takes a part of it, because infinite straightness is not
 partible. Now, the longer a straight finite line is, the more it seems to
 participate in the infinity of an infinite, maximum line.
 A finite straight line, insofar as it is straight (minimal curvature
 is a reduction to that which is straight) participates in the infinite line
 according to a more simple participation, and a curve [participates in
 the infinite line] not [according to] a simple and immediate participa
tion but rather [according to] a mediate and remote participation; for
 [it participates] through the medium of the straightness in which it par
ticipates. (Similarly, some beings—viz., simple finite substances—par
ticipate more immediately in Maximum Being, which exists in itself.
 And other beings—viz., accidents—participate in [Maximum] Being
 not through themselves but through the medium of substances.)
 Hence—the difference in participation notwithstanding—the straight
 is the measure of itself and of the not-straight, as states Aristotle.98
 Just as an infinite line [is the measure] of a straight line and of a
 curved line, so the Maximum [is the measure] of all things which par
ticipate [in it], no matter how differently.
 In this [illustration] is disclosed an understanding of the statement
30
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 18 - 19
 that substance does not admit of more or less. This statement is true—
 even as [it is true that] a finite straight line, insofar as it is straight,
 does not admit of more and less. But because [it is] finite, one
 [straight] line is—through a difference of participation in the infinite
 line—longer or shorter in relation to another; no two [finite lines] are
 ever found to be equal. But a curve admits of more and less, accord
ing as it participates in straightness. Consequently, as being something
 straight through participated straightness, the curve admits of more and
 less. By analogous reasoning: accidents are more excellent in propor
tion to their participation in substance; and, further, the more they par
ticipate in a more excellent substance, the still more excellent they are.
 Moreover, through this [illustration] we see how it is that there can
 be only beings which participate in the being of the First either
 through themselves or through other than themselves—just as there are
 only lines, either straight or curved. Wherefore, Aristotle 99 was right
 in dividing all the things in the world into substance and accident.
 54
 55
 There is, then, one most congruent measure of substance and of
 accident—viz., the most simple Maximum. Although the Maximum
 is neither substance nor accident, nevertheless from the foregoing we
 see clearly that it receives the name of those things which participate
 in it immediately, viz., substances, rather than [the name] of accidents.
 Hence, the very great Dionysius100 calls it more -than- substance, or
 supersubstantial, rather than superaccidental. Since to say “supersub
stantial” is to say more than [to say] “superaccidental,” the former is
 more fittingly predicated of the Maximum. Now, we say supersub
stantial—i.e., not substantial but above substance (for the substantial
 is lower than it). And so, “supersubstantial” is a negation, quite truly
 befitting the Maximum, as I shall later teach regarding the names of
 God.101
 On the basis of the foregoing considerations someone could make
 an extensive inquiry regarding the difference between, and the excel
lence of, accidents and substances. But this is not the place for deal
ing with these matters.
 Chapter Nineteen: The likening of an infinite
 triangle to maximum trinity.
 Regarding what was stated and shown, viz., that a maximum line is a
 maximum triangle: let us now become instructed in ignorance. We
 have seen102 that a maximum line is an [infinite] triangle; and because
31
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 19
 [this] line is most simple, it will be something most simple and three.
 Every angle of the triangle will be the line, since the triangle as a
 whole is the line. Hence, the infinite line is three. But there cannot be
 more than one infinite thing. Therefore, this trinity is oneness.
 Moreover, as is shown in geometry: the angle opposite the longer
 side is the larger. Now, the [maximum triangle] is a triangle which
 has no side except an infinite side. Hence, the angles will be maxi
mum and infinite. Therefore, one angle is not smaller than the others,
 nor are two of them larger than the third. Rather, because there could
 not be any quantity outside of infinite quantity, there cannot be any
 angles outside of the one infinite angle. Therefore, the angles will be
 in one another; and all three angles [will be] one maximum.
 56
 57
 Furthermore, a maximum line is just as much a triangle, a cir
cle, and a sphere as it is a line; it is truly and incompositely all these,
 as was shown.103 Similarly, the unqualifiedly Maximum can be
 likened to the linear maximum, which we can call essence; it can
 be likened to the triangular maximum and can be called trinity; it
 can be likened to the circular maximum and can be called oneness;
 it can be likened to the spherical maximum and can be called actu
al existence. Therefore, the Maximum is actually one trine essence,
 although it is most true that the Maximum is these identically and
 most simply; the essence is not other than the trinity; and the trini
ty is not other than the oneness; and the actuality is not other than
 the oneness, the trinity, or the essence. Therefore, just as it is true that
 the Maximum exists and is one, so it is true that it is three in a way
 in which the truth of the trinity does not contradict the most simple
 oneness but is the oneness.
 The foregoing is not possible otherwise than as is recognizable
 through the correspondence with the maximum triangle. Hence, when
 from the aforesaid we acquire knowledge of the true triangle and the
 most simple line, in the way in which this [knowledge] is possible for
 man, we will attain, in learned ignorance, unto the Trinity. For we
 [shall] see that we do not find first one angle and then another and then
 still another, as in the case of finite triangles; for there cannot be nu
merically different angles in the oneness of an incomposite triangle.
 Rather, one thing exists trinely without numerical multiplication.
 Therefore, most learned Augustine was right in saying that when you
 begin to number the Trinity, you depart from the truth.104 For in the
 case of God we must, as far as possible, precede contradictories and
32
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 19 - 20
 embrace them in a simple concept. For example, in God we must not
 conceive of distinction and indistinction as two contradictories but
 [must conceive of] them as antecedently present in their own most
 simple Beginning, where distinction is not anything other than indis
tinction; and then we will conceive more clearly that the trinity and
 the oneness are the same thing. For where distinction is indistinction,
 trinity is oneness; and, conversely, where indistinction is distinction,
 oneness is trinity. And similarly about the plurality of persons and the
 oneness of essence: for where plurality is oneness, trinity of persons
 is the same as oneness of essence; and, conversely, where oneness is
 plurality, oneness of essence is trinity of persons.
 58
 59
 The foregoing points are clearly seen in our illustration, where the
 most simple line is a triangle, and, conversely, the simple triangle is
 linear oneness. In our illustration we also see that the angles of the
 triangle cannot be numbered through one, two, three, since each angle
 is in each angle—as the Son says, “I am in the Father, and the Fa
ther is in me.”105 Yet, the truth of a triangle requires that there be
 three angles. Hence, in our illustration there are most truly three an
gles; and each one is a maximum angle; and all are one maximum.
 Moreover, the truth of a triangle requires that no one angle be the
 other; and, in like manner, in the illustration the truth of the oneness
 of the most simple essence requires that these three angles not be three
 distinct things but be one thing. And this requirement, too, is met in
 the illustration.
 Therefore, join together antecedently, as I said, these things which
 seem to be opposites, and you will have not one thing and three things,
 or three things and one thing, but the Triune, or Unitrine. And this is
 Absolute Truth.
 Chapter Twenty: Still more regarding the Trinity. There
 cannot be fourness, [fiveness], etc.,
 in God.
 Furthermore, the truth of the Trinity—a Trinity which is Triunity—
 requires that the trine be one, because [the trine] is spoken of as tri
une. But the triune comes under a concept only in the manner in
 which a mutual relationship unites distinct things and an order dis
tinguishes them. Now, when we construct a finite triangle there is first
 one angle, then another, and then a third from the first two; and these
 angles bear a mutual relationship to one another, so that from them
33
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 20
 there is one triangle. By comparison, then, [this mutual relationship
 obtains] infinitely in the infinite. Nevertheless, we must view this
 [mutual relationship] in the following way: viz., that priority is con
ceived to be in the eternity in such way that posteriority does not con
tradict it. For priority and posteriority could not belong in any other
 way to the infinite and eternal. Hence, it is not the case that the Fa
ther is prior to the Son and that the Son is posterior [to the Father];
 rather, the Father is prior in such way that the Son is not posterior.
 The Father is the first person in such way that the Son is not subse
quently the second person; rather, just as the Father is the first per
son without priority, so the Son is the second person without posteri
ority; and, in a similar way, the Holy Spirit is the third person. Let
 this [discussion] suffice, since [the topic] was dealt with more fully
 earlier.106
 60
 However, you might like to note, regarding this ever-blessed Trin
ity, that the Maximum is three and not four or five or more. This point
 is surely noteworthy. For [fourness or fiveness, etc.] would be incon
sistent with the simplicity and the perfection of the Maximum. For
 example, every polygonal figure has a triangular figure as its simplest
 element; moreover, a triangular figure is the minimal polygonal fig
ure—than which there cannot be a smaller figure. Now, we proved107
 that the unqualifiedly minimum coincides with the maximum. There
fore, just as one is to numbers, so a triangle is to polygonal figures.
 Therefore, just as every number is reducible to oneness, so [all] poly
gons are [reducible] to a triangle. Therefore, the maximum triangle,
 with which the minimum triangle coincides., encompasses all polyg
onal figures. For just as maximum oneness is to every number, so the
 maximum triangle is to every polygon. But, as is obvious, a quadran
gular figure is not the minimum figure, because a triangular figure is
 smaller than it. Therefore, a quadrangular figure—which cannot be de
void of composition, since it is greater than the minimum—cannot at
 all be congruent with the most simple maximum, which can coincide
 only with the minimum. Indeed, “to be maximum and to be quadran
gular” involves a contradiction. For [a quadrangle] could not be a con
gruent measure of triangular figures., because it would always exceed
 them. Hence, how could that which would not be the measure of all
 things be the maximum? Indeed, how could that which would derive
 from another and would be composite, and hence finite, be the max
imum?
34
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 20
 61
 62
 It is now evident why from the potency of a simple line there first
 arises a simple triangle (as regards polygons), then a simple circle, and
 then a simple sphere; and we do not arrive at other than these ele
mental figures which are disproportional to one another in finite things
 and which enfold within themselves all figures. Hence, if we wanted
 to conceive of the measures of all measurable quantities: first we
 would have to have, for length, a maximum, infinite line, with which
 the minimum would coincide; then, similarly, for rectilinear size [we
 would have to have] a maximum triangle; and for circular size, a max
imum circle; and for depth, a maximum sphere; and with other than
 these four we could not attain to all measurable things. And because
 all these measures would have to be infinite and maximum measures,
 with which the minimum would coincide, and since there cannot be
 more than one maximum: we say that the one maximum, which is sup
posed to be the measure of all quantities, is those things108 without
 which it could not be the maximum measure. Yet, considered in it
self, without relation to what is measurable, it neither is nor can be
 truly called any of these things; rather, it is infinitely and dispropor
tionally above them.
 By comparison, then, since the unqualifiedly Maximum is the
 measure of everything, we predicate of it those attributes without
 which we do not consider it to be able to be the measure of everything.
 Hence, although the Maximum is infinitely above all trinity, we call
 it trine; for otherwise we would not be considering it to be the sim
ple Cause and Measure of the things whose oneness of being is a trin
ity—even as, with regard to figures, triangular oneness consists of a
 trinity of angles. Yet, in truth: if this consideration is eliminated, then
 neither the name “trinity” nor our concept of trinity at all befit the
 Maximum; rather, [the name and the concept] fall infinitely short of
 this maximal and incomprehensible Truth.
 And so, we regard the maximum triangle as the simplest measure
 of all trinely existing things--even as activities are actions existing
 trinely (1) in potency, (2) in regard to an object, and (3) in actuality.
 The case is similar regarding perceptions, thoughts, volitions, like
nesses, unlikenesses, adornments, comparative relations, mutual rela
tions, natural appetites, and all other things whose oneness of being
 consists of plurality—e.g., especially a nature's being and activity,
 which consist of a mutual relationship between what acts, what is
 acted upon, and what derives commonly from these two.
35
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 21
 63
 64
 Chapter Twenty-one: The likening of an infinite circle
 to oneness.
 We considered a few points regarding a maximum triangle. Let us like
wise add [a few points] about an infinite circle. A circle is a perfect
 figure of oneness and simplicity. Earlier109 I showed that a [maxi
mum] triangle is a circle; and so, trinity is oneness. But this oneness
 is infinite, just as the circle is infinite. Therefore, it is infinitely more
 one, or more identical, than any oneness110 expressible and appre
hensible by us. For the identity in an infinite circle is so great that it
 precedes all oppositions—even relative oppositions. For in an infinite
 circle other and different are not opposed to identity.
 Therefore, [by comparison]: since the Maximum is of infinite one
ness, all the things which befit it are it, without difference and other
ness. Thus, its goodness is not different from its wisdom but is the
 same thing; for in the Maximum all difference is identity. Hence, since
 the Maximum's power is most one, its power is also most powerful
 and most infinite. The Maximum's most one duration is so great that
 in its duration the past is not other than the future, and the future is
 not other than the present; rather, they are the most one duration, or
 eternity, without beginning and end. For in the Maximum the begin
ning is so great that even the end is—in the Maximum—the begin
ning.
 All these [points] are exhibited by the infinite circle, which is eter
nal,111 without beginning and end, indivisibly the most one and the
 most encompassing. Because this circle is maximum, its diameter is
 also maximum. And since there cannot be more than one maximum,
 this circle is most one to such an extent that the diameter is the cir
cumference. Now, an infinite diameter has an infinite middle. But the
 middle is the center. Therefore, it is evident that the center, the diam
eter, and the circumference are the same thing.
 Accordingly, our ignorance is taught that the Maximum, to which
 the Minimum is not opposed, is incomprehensible. But in the Maxi
mum the center is the circumference. You see that because the center
 is infinite, the whole of the Maximum is present most perfectly with
in everything as the Simple and the Indivisible; moreover, it is outside
 of every being—surrounding all things, because the circumference is
 infinite, and penetrating all things, because the diameter is infinite. It
 is the Beginning of all things, because it is the center; it is the End of
 all things, because it is the circumference; it is the Middle of all things,
36
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 21 - 22
 because it is the diameter. It is the efficient Cause, since it is the cen
ter; it is the formal Cause, since it is the diameter; it is the final Cause,
 since it is the circumference. It bestows being, for it is the center; it
 regulates being, for it is the diameter; it conserves being, for it is the
 circumference. And many similar such things.
 65
 66
 67
 And so, your intellect apprehends that the Maximum is neither
 identical with nor different from anything and that all things are in it,
 from it, and through it, because it is the circumference, the diameter,
 and the center. [I do] not [mean] that it really is the circle, the circum
ference, the diameter, or the center; rather, it is only the most simple
 Maximum, which is investigated by means of these symbolisms. And
 it is found to surround all existing and non-existing things, so that in it
 not-being is maximum being, just as the Minimum is the Maximum. It
 is the measure (1) of all circular movement from potentiality to actu
ality and back again from actuality to potentiality, (2) of the composi
tion from first principles to individuals and of the resolution of indi
viduals to first principles, (3) of perfect forms of circular things, (4) of
 circular activities and motions which turn back on themselves and re
turn to their [respective] beginning, and (5) of all such [motions] whose
 oneness consists of a perpetual circularity.
 From this circular figure many [points] might here be elicited
 about the perfection of oneness. For the sake of brevity I will pass over
 them, for on the basis of the aforesaid they can be readily inferred by
 anyone. I call attention only to the following: that all theology is cir
cular and is based upon a circle.112 [This is true] to such an extent
 that the names for the [divine] attributes are predicated truly of one
 another in a circular manner. For example, supreme justice is supreme
 truth, and supreme truth is supreme justice; and similarly for all the
 others. Accordingly, if you want to prolong the inquiry, an infinite
 number of theological [points] which are now hidden from you can
 be made very obvious to you.
 Chapter Twenty-two: How God's foresight
 unites contradictories.
 But so that we may also come to see how through the previous points
 we are led to a deep understanding, let us direct our inquiry to [the
 topic of] God's foresight. Since it is evident from the foregoing that
 God is the enfolding of all things, even of contradictories, [it is also
37
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 22
 evident that] nothing can escape His foresight. For whether we do
 some thing or its opposite or nothing, the whole of it was enfolded in
 God's foresight. Therefore, nothing will occur except in accordance
 with God's foreseeing.
 68
 69
 Hence, although God could have foreseen many things which He
 did not foresee and will not foresee and although He foresaw many
 things which He was able not to foresee, nevertheless nothing can be
 added to or subtracted from divine foresight. By way of comparison:
 Human nature is simple and one; if a human being were born who was
 never even expected to be born, nothing would be added to human
 nature. Similarly, nothing would be subtracted from human nature if
 [the human being] were not born—just as nothing [is subtracted] when
 those who have been born die. This [holds true] because human na
ture enfolds not only those who exist but also those who do not exist
 and will not exist, although they could have existed. In like manner,
 even if what will never occur were to occur, nothing would be added
 to divine foresight, since it enfolds not only what does occur but also
 what does not occur but can occur. Therefore,.just as in matter many
 things which will never occur are present as possibilities so, by con
trast, whatever things will not occur but can occur: although they are
 present in God's foresight, they are present not possibly but actually.113
 Nor does it follow herefrom that these things exist actually.
 Accordingly, we say that “human nature enfolds and embraces an
 infinite number of things” because it [enfolds] not only the human be
ings who did exist, do exist, and will exist but also those who can
 exist, though they never will (and so, human nature embraces muta
ble things immutably, just as infinite oneness [embraces] every num
ber). In a similar way, God's infinite foresight enfolds not only the
 things which will occur but also the things which will not occur but
 can occur (and it enfolds contraries, even as a genus enfolds contrary
 differentiae). Those things which [infinite foresight] knows, it knows
 without a difference of times; for it is not the case that it knows fu
ture things as future, and past things as past; rather, it [knows] muta
ble things eternally and immutably.
 Hence, divine foresight is inescapable and immutable. Nothing
 can transcend it. Hence, all things related to it are said to have ne
cessity-and rightly so, since in God all things are God,114 who is Ab
solute Necessity. And so, it is evident that the things which will never
 occur are present in God's foresight in the aforesaid manner, even if
38
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 22 - 23
 they are not foreseen to occur. It is necessary that God foresaw what
 He foresaw, because His foresight is necessary and immutable, even
 though He was able to foresee even the opposite of that which He did
 foresee. For if enfolding is posited, it is not the case that the thing
 which was enfolded is posited; but if unfolding is posited, enfolding
 is [also] posited. For example, although I am able to read or not to read
 tomorrow: no matter which of these I shall do, I will not escape
 [God's] foresight, which embraces [i.e., enfolds] contraries. Hence,
 whatever I shall do will occur in accordance with God's foresight.
 And so, the following is evident: how it is that through the fore
going points (which teach us that the Maximum precedes all opposi
tion since it somehow embraces and enfolds all things), we apprehend
 what is true about God's foresight and other such matters.
 70
 71
 Chapter Twenty-three: The likening of an infinite sphere
 to the actual existence of God.
 It is fitting to reflect upon still a few more points regarding an infi
nite sphere. In an infinite sphere we find that three maximum lines—
 of length, width, and depth—meet in a center. But the center of a max
imum sphere is equal to the diameter and to the circumference.115
 Therefore, in an infinite sphere the center is equal to these three lines;
 indeed, the center is all three: viz., the length, the width, and the depth.
 And so, [by comparison], the Maximum will be—infinitely and most
 simply—all length, width, and depth; in the Maximum these are the
 one most simple, indivisible Maximum. As a center, the Maximum
 precedes all width, length, and depth; it is the End and the Middle of
 all these; for in an infinite sphere the center, the diameter, and the cir
cumference are the same thing. And just as an infinite sphere is most
 simple and exists in complete actuality, so the Maximum exists most
 simply in complete actuality. And just as a sphere is the actuality of
 a line, a triangle, and a circle, so the Maximum is the actuality of all
 things. Therefore, all actual existence has from the Maximum what
ever actuality it possesses; and all existence exists actually insofar as
 it exists actually in the Infinite. Hence, the Maximum is the Form of
 forms and the Form of being, 116 or maximum actual Being.
 Hence, Parmenides,117 reflecting most subtly, said that God is He
 for whom to be anything which is is to be everything which is. There
fore, just as a sphere is the ultimate perfection of figures and is that
 than which there is no more perfect [figure], so the Maximum is the
39
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 23 - 24
 most perfect perfection of all things. [It is perfection] to such an ex
tent that in it everything imperfect is most perfect—just as an infinite
 line is [an infinite] sphere, and in this sphere118 curvature is straight
ness, composition is simplicity, difference is identity, otherness is one
ness, and so on. For how could there be any imperfection in that in
 which imperfection is infinite perfection, possibility is infinite actual
ity, and so on?
 72
 73
 74
 Since the Maximum is like a maximum sphere, we now see clear
ly that it is the one most simple and most congruent measure of the
 whole universe and of all existing things in the universe;119 for in it
 the whole is not greater than the part, just as an infinite sphere is not
 greater than an infinite line. Therefore, God is the one most simple
 Essence (ratio) of the whole world, or universe.120 And just as after
 an infinite number of circular motions an [infinite] sphere arises, so
 God (like a maximum sphere) is the most simple measure of all cir
cular motions. For all animation, motion, and understanding are from
 Him, in Him, and through Him.121 With God one revolution of the
 eighth sphere is not smaller than [one revolution] of an infinite
 [sphere], because He in whom as in an end all motion finds rest is the
 End of all motions. For He is maximal rest, in which all motion is rest.
 And so, maximum rest is the measure of all motions, just as maximum
 straightness [is the measure] of all circumferences, and as maximum
 presence, or eternity, [is the measure] of all times.
 Therefore, in God as in an end all natural movements find rest;
 and in Him as in infinite actuality all possibility is realized. And be
cause He is the Being of all being and because all motion is toward
 being, He who is the End of motion, viz., the Form and the Actuali
ty of being, is the cessation of motion.
 Therefore, all beings tend toward Him. And because they are fi
nite and cannot participate equally in this End relatively to one an
other, some participate in it through the medium of others. Analo
gously, a line, through the medium of a triangle and of a circle, is
 transformed into a sphere; and a triangle [is transformed into a
 sphere] through the medium of a circle; and through itself a circle
 [is transformed] into a sphere.122
 Chapter Twenty-four: The name of God;
 affirmative theology.
 Now that in our ignorance we have striven—with divine assistance
40
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 24
 and by means of mathematical illustration—to become more knowl
edgeable about the First Maximum, let us inquire about the name of
 the Maximum, in order that our learning may be still more complete.
 If we rightly keep in mind the points already frequently made, this
 inquiry will easily lead to discovery.
 75
 76
 77
 Since the Maximum is the unqualifiedly Maximum, to which
 nothing is opposed, it is evident that no name can properly befit it. For
 all names are bestowed on the basis of a oneness of conception [ratio]
 through which one thing is distinguished from another. But where all
 things are one, there can be no proper name. Hence, Hermes Tris
megistus rightly says: “Since God is the totality of things, no name
 is proper to Him; for either He would have to be called by every name
 or else all things would have to be called by His name”;123 for in His
 simplicity He enfolds the totality of things. Hence, as regards His own
 name, which we say to be ineffable and which is “tetragrammaton”
 (i.e., “of four letters”) and which is proper because it befits God ac
cording to His own essence, not according to any relation to created
 things: He ought to be called “One-and-all,” or better, “All-in-one.”
 And in like manner we previously124 discovered [the name] “Maxi
mum Oneness,” which is the same thing as “All-in-one”; indeed, the
 name “Oneness” seems still closer and still more suitable than the
 name “All-in-one.” Wherefore the prophet says: “On that day there
 will be one God, and His name will be one.”125 And elsewhere: “Hear,
 0 Israel,” (“Israel” means “one who sees God with the understanding”)
 “that your God is one.”126
 However, it is not the case that “Oneness” is the name of God
 in the way in which we either name or understand oneness; for just
 as God transcends all understanding, so, a fortiori, [He transcends]
 every name. Indeed, through a movement of reason, which is much
 lower than the intellect,127 names are bestowed for distinguishing be
tween things. But since reason cannot leap beyond contradictories:
 as regards the movement of reason, there is not a name to which an
other [name] is not opposed. Therefore, as regards the movement of
 reason: plurality or multiplicity is opposed to oneness. Hence, not
 “oneness” but “Oneness to which neither otherness nor plurality nor
 multiplicity is opposed” befits God. This is the maximum name,
 which enfolds all things in its simplicity of oneness; this is the name
 which is ineffable and above all understanding.128 For who could un
derstand the infinite Oneness which infinitely precedes all opposi
tion?—where all things are incompositely enfolded in simplicity of
41
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 24
 Oneness, where there is neither anything which is other nor anything
 which is different, where a man does not differ from a lion, and the
 sky does not differ from the earth. Nevertheless., in the Maximum they
 are most truly the Maximum, [though] not in accordance with their
 finitude; rather, [they are] Maximum Oneness in an enfolded way.
 Hence, if anyone were able to understand or to name such Oneness—
 which, since it is Oneness is all things and since it is the Minimum is
 the Maximum—he would attain to the name of God. But since the
 Name-of-God is God, His Name is known only by [that] Under
standing which is the Maximum and is the Maximum Name. There
fore, in learned ignorance we attain unto [the following]: Although
 “Oneness” seems to be a quite close name for the Maximum, never
theless it is still infinitely distant from the true Name of the Maxi
mum—[a Name] which is the Maximum.
 78
 79
 And so, from these considerations it is evident that the affirma
tive names we ascribe to God befit Him [only] infinitesimally. For
 such [names] are ascribed to Him in accordance with something found
 in created things. Therefore, since any such particular or discrete thing,
 or thing having an opposite, can befit God only very minutely: affir
mations are scarcely fitting, as Dionysius says.129 For example, if you
 call God “Truth,” falsity is the contradistinction; if you call Him
 “Virtue,” vice is the contradistinction; if you call Him “Substance,”
 accident is the contradistinction; and so on. But since God is not a sub
stance which is not all things and to which something is opposed, and
 is not a truth which is not all things without opposition, these partic
ular names cannot befit Him except very infinitesimally. For it is not
 the case that any affirmations—which posit in Him, as it were, some
thing of what they signify—can befit Him who is not some particular
 thing more than He is all things.
 Therefore, if affirmative names befit God, they befit Him only in
 relation to created things. [I do] not [mean] that created things are the
 cause of [these names'] befitting Him, for the Maximum can have
 nothing from created things; rather, [I mean that these names] befit
 Him on the basis of His infinite power in relation to created things.
 For God was eternally able to create, because unless He had been able,
 He would not have been supreme power. Therefore, although the name
 “Creator” befits Him in relation to created things, it also befit Him be
fore there was a created thing, since He was eternally able to create.
 The case is similar with “justice” and all the other affirmative names
42
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 24
 which we symbolically ascribe to God on the basis of created things
 because of a certain perfection signified by these names. Nonetheless,
 even before we ascribed all these names to God, they were eternally
 and truly enfolded in His supreme perfection and in His infinite
 name—as were all the things (1) which are signified by such names
 and (2) from which we transfer [the names] to God.
 80
 81
 82
 The aforesaid is so true of all affirmations that even the names
 of the Trinity and of the persons—viz., “Father,” “Son,” and “Holy
 Spirit”—are bestowed on God in relation to created things. For be
cause God is Oneness, He is Begetter and Father; because He is
 Equality of Oneness, He is Begotten, or Son; because He is Union
 of both [Oneness and Equality-of-Oneness], He is Holy Spirit.130 Ac
cordingly, it is clear that the Son is called Son because He is Equal
ity of Oneness, or of Being, or of existing.131 Hence, from the fact
 that God was eternally able to create things—even had He not creat
ed them—it is evident [that] He is called Son in relation to these
 things. For He is Son because He is Equality of being [these] things;
 things could not exist beyond or short of Equality. Thus, He is Son
 because He is Equality of being of the things which God was able
 to make, even had He not been going to make them. Were God not
 able to make these things, He would not be Father, Son, or Holy Spir
it; indeed, He would not be God. Therefore, if you reflect quite care
fully, [you will see that] for the Father to beget the Son was [for Him]
 to create all things in the Word.132 Wherefore, Augustine133 main
tains that the Word is both the Art and the Idea in relation to creat
ed things. Hence, God is Father because He begets Equality of One
ness; but He is Holy Spirit because He is the Love common to both
 [Oneness and Equality of Oneness]; and He is all these134 in relation
 to created things. For created things begin to be by virtue of the fact
 that God is Father; they are perfected by virtue of the fact that He is
 Son; they harmonize with the universal order of things by virtue of the
 fact that He is Holy Spirit. And in each thing these are traces of the
 Trinity. Moreover, this is the opinion of Aurelius Augustine when he
 expounds the following passage from Genesis: “In the beginning God
 created heaven and earth.” For he says that by virtue of the fact that
 God is Father He created the beginnings of things.135
 Therefore, whatever is said about God through affirmative theol
ogy is based upon a relationship to created things. [This is true] even
 with respect to those most holy names in which the greatest myster
43
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 24 - 25
 ies of divine knowledge lie hidden. These names are found among the
 Hebrews and the Chaldees; all of them signify God only according to
 some individual property—[all] except for the name from four letters,
 viz., ioth, he, vau, he. (This is the proper and ineffable [name], pre
viously commented on.)136 Jerome and also Rabbi Solomon (in his
 book Dux Neutrorum)137 deal extensively with these names. They can
 be consulted.
 83
 84
 Chapter Twenty-five: The pagans named God in various
 ways in relation to created things.
 The pagans likewise named God from His various relationships to cre
ated things. [They named Him] Jupiter because of marvelous kind
ness (for Julius Firmicus138 says that Jupiter is a star so auspicious
 that had he reigned alone in the heavens, men would be immortal);
 similarly, [they named Him] Saturn because of a profundity of
 thoughts and inventions regarding the necessities of life; Mars because
 of military victories; Mercury because of good judgment in counsel
ing; Venus because of love which conserves nature; Sun because of
 the force of natural movements; Moon because of conservation of the
 fluids upon which life depends; Cupid because of the unity of the two
 sexes (for which reason they also called Him Nature, since through the
 two sexes He conserves the species of things). Hermes139 said that not
 only all [species of] animals but also all [species of] non-animals have
 two sexes; wherefore, he maintained that the Cause of all things, viz.,
 God, enfolds within Himself both the masculine and the feminine sex,
 of which he believed Cupid and Venus to be the unfolding. Va
lerius,140 too, the Roman, making the same affirmation, professed that
 Jupiter is the omnipotent Divine Father and Mother. Hence, in accor
dance with one thing's desiring (cupit) another, they gave to the daugh
ter of Venus, i.e., of natural beauty, the name “Cupid.” But they said
 that Venus is the daughter of omnipotent Jupiter, from whom Nature
 and all its accompaniments derive.
 Even the temples—viz., the Temple of Peace, the Temple of Eter
nity, the Temple of Harmony, and the Pantheon (in which there was
 in the middle, under the open air, the altar of the Infinite Limit, of
 which there is no limit)—and other such [edifices] inform us that the
 pagans named God in various ways in accordance with His relation
ship to created things. All these names are unfoldings of the enfold
44
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 25 -26
 ing of the one ineffable name.141 And as accords with [this] proper
 name's being infinite, it enfolds an infinite number of such names of
 particular perfections. Therefore, the unfolded [names] could be many
 without being so many and so great that there could not be more of
 them. Each of them is related to the proper and ineffable name [i.e.,
 to the tetragrammaton] as what is finite is related to what is infinite.
 The ancient pagans derided the Jews, who worshiped one infinite
 God of whom they were ignorant. Nevertheless, these pagans them
selves worshiped Him in unfolded things—i.e., worshiped Him where
 they beheld His divine works. In those days there was the following
 difference among all men: viz., [although] all believed that God is the
 one Maximum, than which there cannot be a greater, some of them
 (e.g., the Jews and the Sissennii)142 worshiped Him in His most sim
ple oneness (as the Enfolding of all things is); but others worshiped
 Him in the things in which they found the unfolding of His divinity,
 construing what was perceptually-observed as guidance toward the
 Cause and Beginning. In this last-mentioned way the simple populace
 was deceived; for they construed the unfolded things not as images but
 as the reality itself. As a result thereof, idolatry was introduced to the
 people—though, for the most part, the wise continued rightly to be
lieve in the oneness of God. These points can be known to anyone who
 will carefully examine Cicero On the Nature of the Gods,143 as well
 as the ancient philosophers.
 85
 86
 I do not deny, however, that certain of the pagans did not under
stand that since God is the being of things, He exists independently
 of things in a way other than through abstraction. (By comparison,
 prime matter exists independently of things only through the ab
stracting intellect). Such men worshiped God in created things; they
 also provided idolatry with supporting reasons. Certain men even
 thought that God can be summoned forth.144 For example, the Sis
sennii summoned Him in angels. But the pagans summoned Him in
 trees, as we read regarding the Tree of the Sun and the Moon. Others
 summoned Him, with fixed incantations, in air, water, or temples. My
 earlier remarks show how deceived all these men were and how far
 they were from the truth.
 Chapter Twenty-six: Negative theology.
 The worshipping of God, who is to be worshiped in spirit and in
45
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 26
 truth,145 must be based upon affirmations about Him. Accordingly,
 every religion, in its worshipping, must mount upward by means of af
firmative theology. [Through affirmative theology] it worships God
 as one and three, as most wise and most gracious, as Inaccessible
 Light, as Life, Truth, and so on. And it always directs its worship by
 faith, which it attains more truly through learned ignorance. It believes
 that He whom it worships as one is All-in-one, and that He whom. it
 worships as Inaccessible Light is not light as is corporeal light, to
 which darkness is opposed, but is infinite and most simple Light, in
 which darkness is Infinite Light; and [it believes] that Infinite Light
 always shines within the darkness of our ignorance but [that] the dark
ness cannot comprehend it.146 And so, the theology of negation is so
 necessary for the theology of affirmation that without it God would
 not be worshiped as the Infinite God but, rather, as a creature. And
 such worship is idolatry; it ascribes to the image that which befits only
 the reality itself. Hence, it will be useful to set down a few more things
 about negative theology.
 87
 88
 Sacred ignorance has taught us that God is ineffable. He is so be
cause He is infinitely greater than all nameable things. And by virtue
 of the fact that [this] is most true, we speak of God more truly through
 removal and negation—as [teaches] the greatest Dionysius, who did
 not believe that God is either Truth or Understanding or Light or any
thing which can be spoken of147 (Rabbi Solomon148 and all the wise
 follow Dionysius.) Hence, in accordance with this negative theology,
 according to which [God] is only infinite, He is neither Father nor Son
 nor Holy Spirit. Now, the Infinite qua Infinite is neither Begetting, Be
gotten, nor Proceeding. Therefore, when Hilary of Poitiers distin
guished the persons, he most astutely used the expressions “Infinity
 in the Eternal,” “Beauty in the Image,” and “Value in the Gift.”149
 He means that although in eternity we can see only infinity, never
theless since the infinity which is eternity is negative infinity, it can
not be understood as Begetter but [can] rightly [be understood as] eter
nity, since “eternity” is affirmative of oneness, or maximum presence.
 Hence, [Infinity- in-the-Eternal is] the Beginning without beginning. 
“Beauty in the Image” indicates the Beginning from the Beginning.
 “Value in the Gift” indicates the Procession from these two.
 All these things are very well known through the preceding [dis
cussion]. For although eternity is infinity, so that eternity is not a
 greater cause of the Father than is infinity: nevertheless, in a manner
46
 De Docta Ignorantia I, 26
 of considering, eternity is attributed to the Father and not to the Son
 or to the Holy Spirit; but infinity is not [attributed] to one person more
 than to another. For according to the consideration of oneness infini
ty is the Father; according to the consideration of equality of oneness
 it is the Son; according to the consideration of the union [of the two
 it is] the Holy Spirit. And according to the simple consideration of it
self infinity is neither the Father nor the Son nor the Holy Spirit. Yet,
 infinity (as also eternity) is each of the three persons, and, converse
ly, each person is infinity (and eternity)—not, however, according to
 [the simple] consideration [of itself], as I said. For according to the
 consideration of infinity God is neither one nor many. Now, accord
ing to the theology of negation, there is not found in God anything
 other than infinity. Therefore, according to this theology [God] is not
 knowable either in this world or in the world to come (for in this re
spect every created thing is darkness, which cannot comprehend Infi
nite Light), but is known only to Himself.
 89
 From these [observations] it is clear (1) that in theological mat
ters negations are true and affirmations are inadequate, and (2) that,
 nonetheless, the negations which remove the more imperfect things
 from the most Perfect are truer than the others. For example, it is truer
 that God is not stone than that He, is not life or intelligence; and [it
 is truer that He] is not drunkenness than that He is not virtue. The con
trary [holds] for affirmations; for the affirmation which states that God
 is intelligence and life is truer than [the affirmation that He is] earth
 or stone or body. All these [points] are very clear from the foregoing.
 Therefrom we conclude that the precise truth shines incomprehensi
bly within the darkness of our ignorance. This is the learned ignorance
 we have been seeking and through which alone, as I explained, [we]
 can approach the maximum, triune God of infinite goodness—[ap
proach Him] according to the degree of our instruction in ignorance,
 so that with all our might we may ever praise Him, who is forever
 blessed above all things,150 for manifesting to us His incomprehensi
ble self.151

 28. A number of references in the Notes have been adapted from Vol. I of the Hei
delberg Academy edition of Nicolai de Cusa Opera Omnia.
 29. To reduce publication costs, extensive references to the writings of Anicius
 Boethius, Meister Eckhart, and Thierry of Chartres have not been incorporated
 into the Notes. Readers are advised to consult the works of Joseph E. Hofmann,

 NOTES TO LEARNED IGNORANCE, BOOK ONE
 34. De Coniecturis is also addressed to Cardinal Julian Cesarini (1398-1444),
 whom Nicholas also there refers to as his own venerable teacher. In spite of Josef
 Koch's caveat (Nicolai de Cusa Opera Omnia III, p. 186) there is reason enough to
 believe that Cesarini, though only a little older than Nicholas, had indeed been one
 of his instructors at the University of Padua. The two were to meet again at the Coun
cil of Basel, over which Julian presided.
 35. See Aristotle's Metaphysics—both the opening sentence and I, 2 (982b 12

 38. DI I, 11 (3 1:1-4).
 39. Throughout DI Nicholas frequently uses the word “proportio” (as well as the
 adjective “proportionalis” and the adverb “proportionabiliter”). I have usually ad
hered to the following English renderings: proportio-comparative relation, relation;
 comparativa proportio-comparative relation; proportionaliter-proportionally; propor
tionalis-proportional, improportiontiliter-disproportionally, incomparably; impropor
tionalis-disproportional.

 42. Job 28:20-21.
 43. Aristotle, Metaphysics 11, 1 (993b 9-11).
 44. “Maximitas” means not merely magnitudo (greatness) but maxima magnitu
do (maximal greatness). Nor is “maximitas” always a shorthand for “absoluta maxim
itas,” for Nicholas also speaks of the universe as maximitas—viz., maximitas con
tracta [II, 8 (139:10-11)].
 45. I Tim. 6:16.
 46. Wenck pays tribute to Nicholas's Latin style (IL 19:5), calling it “sufficient
ly elegant.” But, in fact, Nicholas's style can appear elegant only to someone like
 Wenck, whose own is so much worse.
 47. Literally: “ . . . showing at the outset learned ignorance's basis in the inap
prehensible precision of the truth.”
 48. In the chapter title Nicholas uses the word “incomprehensibilis,” though in
 the last line of the preceding chapter he used “inapprehensibilis.” In fact, throughout
 DI and his other treatises he does not systematically distinguish his use of these two
 terms and their cognates. For example, he does not differentiate between apprehend
ing and comprehending God. Nor does he regard comprehendere as simply appre
hendere intellectu; for he writes not only “simplici intellectione apprehendere” but
 also “simplicissima intellectione . . . comprehendere” [I, 10 (29:13; 29: 10-11)]. Fol
Notes to Book One
 50
 lowing the usage of Scripture (John 1:5), he is even willing to say “tenebrae eam [i.e.,
 lucem] comprehendere nequeunt” [I, 26 (86:15-16)], where “apprehendere” would
 serve equally well. Andjustas at 11:9-10 he uses the expression “sensu apprehendere,”
 so in Ap. 2:18 he understands the expression “comprehendi nequeat” to mean “sensu
 comprehendi nequeat.” It is difficult to know whether at Ap. 2:18 he would likewise
 be willing to say “apprehendi nequeat.” As a rule, throughout his writings, both “in
comprehensibilis” and “inapprehensibilis” could acceptably be translated by the one
 English word “ungraspable.”
 49. DI I, 1 (3:2-3); II, 2 (102:4-5).
 50. See II, 1 for examples of this point.
 51. DI II, 1 (91:14-15).
 52. The example of an inscribed polygon is also used in DI III, 1 (188:15-19);
 III, 4 (206:12-18).
 53. Cf. NA 85:15-20.
 54. In NA Nicholas elaborates upon the motif that God is not other than anything.
 In calling God Equality of being and Form of being [DI I, 8 (22:8-10)], Nicholas
 is not suggesting that we can conceive of what it is like for God to be such Equali
ty and such Form [DI I, 4 (11:7-9); I, 12 (33:4-6)]. Indeed, learned ignorance con
sists of the joint recognition that God is undifferentiated being itself and that such
 being is inconceivable by every finite intellect.
 55. Regarding the translation of “[est] omne id quod esse potest,” see PNC, pp.
 173-174, n. 12 and p. 165, n. 66.
 56. Only the maximum thus freed from quantity—i.e., only the absolutely Max
imum—coincides with the (absolutely) Minimum. At the end of the present chapter
 Nicholas makes clear that insofar as the terms “maximum” and “minimum” refer to
 God, they refer to what is beyond all contraction to quantity (or anything else). See
 n. 34 below. Cf. DI II, 8 (140:7-8); II, 9 (148:8; 150:9-10); III, 1 (182:5-6; 183:10
13); II; 8 (136:9-10). Especially note De Visione Dei 13 (58:11-12). Complementum
 Theologicum 12 (last 7 lines), Paris edition. DP 69:6 - 70:11.
 Similarly, only absolutely maximum motion coincides with (absolutely) mini
mum motion [II, 10 (155:1-3)]—both of which are “motion” only in a metaphorical
 sense. Cf. DP 10-11. Likewise, absolutely maximum faith [III, 11 (249:1-2)] is not
 faith in any sense of “faith” that we can understand; for it coincides with God's knowl
edge, and God's knowledge is God, who is inconceivable except to Himself.
 57. Nicholas does not here distinguish intellectus (intellect, understanding) and
 ratio (reason, reasoning), as he does at DI III, 6 (215:5-6). Also note I, 10 (27:14
18); I, 24 (76:4-5); II, 2 (100:9-10); III, 9 (233:6-7); III, 10 (240:1-2). See PNC, p.
 172, n. 175.
 58. DI I, 26.
 59. No matter where you stop on the ascending scale, you stop at a finite num
ber. No matter how far you count, you will have counted only a finite series. [Cf. DI
 II, 1 (96:1-18).] In this sense, the ascending scale is “actually” finite, though poten
tially infinite.
 60. Apparently, Nicholas is arguing, straightforwardly, that if there were no
 source of number, which he has already shown to be finite, then there would not be
 any number. Note the English clause in parentheses at the close of this chapter.
 Nicholas regards fractions not as numbers but as relations between two num
Notes to Book One
 51
 bers. And like Aristotle [Metaphysics X, 1 (1052b 24f.)] he does not regard one as a
 number. [Number, says Aristotle (1053a 3 1), is a plurality of units.] He does, how
ever, place one as the first member of the number series.
 Also note Boethius, De Institutione Arithmetica I, 3 [ed. G. Friedlein (Leipzig:
 B. G. Teubner, 1867; reprinted, Frankfurt: Minerva GmbH, 1966)1: “Numerus est uni
tatum collectio, vel quantitatis acervus ex unitatibus profusus.” Also see I, 23, where
 Boethius puts one at the beginning of the series of natural numbers (“Ponatur enim
 naturalis numerus hoc modo: I. II. III. . . .”)
 61. At 13:30 “unitati” is a dative of comparison, which Nicholas sometimes uses.
 Cf. I, 21 (63:8-9).
 62. DI II, 3 (108:1-15).
 63. Deut. 6:4. DI I, 24 (75:12-76:13).
 64. Matt. 23:8-9.
 65. DI 1, 8.
 66. E.g., DI I, 4 (12:15-16).
 67. God, who is uncontracted, is Maximum Being only insofar as being is un
contracted. But uncontracted and undifferentitated “being” is not being in any sense
 conceivable or nameable by us. Hence Nicholas goes on to state: “Wherefore, al
though it is evident through the aforesaid that the name 'being' (or any other name)
 is not a precise name for the Maximum (which is beyond every name), nevertheless
 it is necessary that being befit it maximally (but in a way not nameable by the name
 ‘maximum’) and above all nameable being.” In DI I, 24-26 Nicholas concedes the
 necessity—for purposes of worship—of conceiving of God as if He were contracted
 to various perfections which are signified by their names in our language, as if His
 trinity were truly describable as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and so on.
 68. In the previous paragraph Nicholas affirmed that “the unqualifiedly Maxi
mum exists.” Proceeding on this basis, he draws the inference that the unqualifiedly
 Maximum cannot rightly be thought ([non] intelligi potest) to be able not to exist,
 since minimal being (i.e., maximal not-being) is maximal being. Apart from the fore
going basis his inference might seem reversible as follows: since maximal being is
 minimal being (i.e., maximal not-being), the unqualifiedly Maximum cannot rightly
 be thought to be able to exist.
 69. Phil. 2:9.
 70. DI I, 5 (14:5-8).
 71. Klibansky thinks that Nicholas confused Varro's Antiquities either with Jose
phus's The Jewish Antiquities XV, 371-379; XVIII, 18 [Loeb Library Series, Cam
bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press), Vol. 8 (1963) trans. Ralph Marcus and Allen
 Wikgren, Vol. 9 (1965) trans. Louis Feldman] or with reports found in Eusebius Cae
sariensis's Praeparationis Evangelicae IX, III, 7 and 13 [ed. G. Dindorf (Leipzig: B.
 G. Teubner, 1867)]. Josephus and Eusebius ascribe the saying to the Essenes rather
 than to the Sissennii. Because the references to Josephus and Eusebius are not quite
 accurate, Wilpert believes that Nicholas was using one or more secondary sources,
 from which he borrowed the references.

 These are not absolutely simple. [Cf. De Coniecturis I, 10 (50) with Idiota de

 Mente 9 (87:14-20)-the latter passage having reference to a continuum.] Likewise,
 when he implies that two objects can be equal-as he does here and in I, 9 (24:7-10),
 he does not mean precisely equal, for only God is precise Equality. [See DI I, 3 (9:13
15); II, 1 (91:9-13).] In general, note DI I, 11 (32:19-24); I, 17 (47:67); II, 1 (96:4
8).
 Cf. n. 26 of the notes to Book Three.
 74. In fact, Nicholas, like Leibniz after him, maintains that no two objects dif
fer in number alone. DI I, 3 (9:13-15); I, 4 (11:9-12); II, 1 (91:12-13) as well as the
 whole of II, 1; III, 1 (188:12-20).
 75. Literally: “But these [two things] will produce a doubleness for one of them.”
 76. Both “conexio” and “unio” are translated throughout by the one English word
 “union,” since Nicholas uses the two words interchangeably. In DI I, 10 (28:14,19)
 he writes “unio sive conexio.” Cf. II, 10 (15 2: 1) with II, 12 (173:13); II, 11 (155:8)
 with III, 12 (262:14); I, 10 (29:6) with I, 10 (29:8).
 77. In the corresponding Latin sentence the word “aliqua” functions as does the
 French word “des” in “Il y a des choses que je ne comprends pas.” Neither “des” nor
 “aliqua” need be translated by a separate English word.
 78. DI I, 24 (80:4-8). Throughout his works—e.g., De Coniecturis II, 17 (173:11
79) and NA 5 (19:7-8)—Nicholas uses “Oneness,” “Equality,” and “Union” to refer
 to the Divine Trinity.
 80. Much of the terminology in this chapter stems from Thierry of Chartres and
 Clarenbald of Arras. For a short discussion of Nicholas's use of Thierry see PNC, pp.
 6-7 and the literature there referred to.
 81. See n. 40 above.
 82. In the corresponding line of the Latin text (24:13) I am reading “unitatis” in
 the place of “unitas”.

 Préaux (Stuttgart: B. G. Teubner, 1978)]. Nicholas's secondary source is John of Sal
isbury, De Septem Septenis VII (PL 199:961C), which wrongly indicates that philos
ophy (instead of philology) left behind circles and spheres.

 88. See n. 24 above.
 89. I.e., understandable (intelligible) to itself but not to any finite intellect.
 90. E.g., DI I, 5 (14:1-6).
 91. I surmise that the Latin text needs to be repunctuated so as to place a colon
 after the first occurrence of “maximum” at 29:6 and a comma (rather than a period)
 after “unio” at 29:8. This way “quoniam” and “hinc” become coordinated , as they
 so often are for Nicholas [e.g., I, 12 (33:4,6); I, 18 (54:8-9); II, 1 (95:1,4)]. Nicholas's
 point seems to be that “one is maximal” indicates a trinity: viz., Minimum (which
 the One is), Maximum, and their Union. Since it has been not only stated but also “es
tablished” that the One is maximal, it has been established that the One is the trini
ty of Minimum, Maximum, and Union—in other words, that Oneness is minimal One
ness, maximal Oneness, and their Union.

 128. DI I, 3 (9:10-15).
 129. Prima facie it is strange that Nicholas speaks of the Maximum as able to
 participate in essence (ratio). What he appears to mean is that since the Maximum is
 Infinite Essence, then in participating in essence, it participates in itself. To say that
 it participates in itself is tantamount to saying that it is, perfectly, its own essence.
 Note DI I, 19 (56:8): “The Maximum is actually one trine essence . . . .”
 N. B. Of God Nicholas uses indifferently the expressions “ratio omnium” and
 “essentia omnium” in DI I, 16-17. But of an infinite line he prefers to use only “ratio
 omnium [linearum].” Still, at I, 19 (56:5) we find “essentia” used of both God and
 an infinite line.

 even an Idea in the mind of God. Rather, his point here is purely conceptual and il

 146. DI 11, 3 (III:8-9). Nicholas seems to have taken this idea from Raymond
 Lull. For a full study of the intellectual relationship between Cusa and Lull, see Eu

 147. In the corresponding line of the Latin text (viz., 68:15) I am reading “etsi”
 in place of “si”. Although Nicholas generally uses “etsi” with the subjunctive, he
 also sometimes uses it with the indicative, as in the Latin sentence above. [Also note,
 e.g., III, 11 (249:3-4) and De Coniecturis II, 1 (75:5-6).] Similarly, although he gen
erally uses “licet” with the subjunctive, he sometimes also uses it with the indica
tive, as at 68:9-10 above. In opting for the reading “etsi” I am following not only
 the sense of the passage but also a clue furnished by Codex Latinus Monacensis
 14213, which has “et” instead of “si”.

 Prologue
 Through certain symbolic signs we have in the foregoing way dis
cussed instruction in ignorance as it regards the nature of the Absolute
 Maximum. Through [the assistance of] this Nature, which shines forth
 a bit to us in a shadow, let us by the same method inquire a bit more
 about those things which are all-that-which-they-are from the Absolute
 Maximum.
 Since what is caused derives altogether from its cause and not at
 all from itself and since it conforms as closely (propinquius et simil
57
De Docta Ignorantia II, 1
 58
 ius) as it can to the Fount and Form [ratio] from which it is that which
 it is: clearly, the nature of contraction is difficult to attain if the Ab
solute Exemplar remains unknown. Therefore, it is fitting that we be
 learned-in-ignorance beyond our understanding [apprehensio], so that
 (though not grasping the truth precisely as it is) we may at least be
 led to seeing that there is a precise truth which we cannot now com
prehend. This is the goal of my work in this part. May Your Clemen
cy1 judge this work and find it acceptable.
 91
 92
 Chapter One: Corollaries preliminary to inferring
 one infinite universe.
 It will be very advantageous to set forth, from out of our beginning,
 the preliminary corollaries of our instruction in ignorance. For they
 will furnish a certain facility regarding an endless number of similar
 points which in like manner can be inferred; and they will make clear
er the points to be discussed.
 I maintained, at the outset of my remarks, that with regard to
 things which are comparatively greater and lesser we do not come to
 a maximum in being and in possibility. Hence, in my earlier [remarks]
 I indicated that precise equality befits only God.2 Wherefore, it fol
lows that, except for God, all positable things differ. Therefore, one
 motion cannot be equal to another; nor can one motion be the mea
sure of another, since, necessarily, the measure and the thing mea
sured differ. Although these points will be of use to you regarding an
 infinite number of things, nevertheless if you transfer them to as
tronomy, you will recognize that the art of calculating lacks precision,
 since it presupposes that the motion of all the other planets can be
 measured by reference to the motion of the sun. Even the ordering
 of the heavens—with respect to whatever kind of place or with re
spect to the risings and settings of the constellations or to the eleva
tion of a pole and to things having to do with these—is not precise
ly knowable. And since no two places agree precisely in time and
 setting, it is evident that judgments about the stars are, in their speci
ficity, far from precise. If you subsequently adapt this rule to mathe
matics, you will see that equality is actually impossible with regard
 to geometrical figures and that no thing can precisely agree with an
other either in shape or in size. And although there are true rules for
 describing the equal of a given figure as it exists in its definition,
 nonetheless equality between different things is actually impossible.3
De Docta Ignorantia II, 1
 59
 Wherefore, ascend to [the recognition] that truth, freed from material
 [conditions], sees, as in a definition, the equality which we cannot at
 all experience in things, since in things equality is present only de
fectively.
 93
 94
 Press onward: Conformably to the rule,4 there is no precision in
 music. Therefore., it is not the case that one thing [perfectly] harmo
nizes with another in weight or length or thickness. Nor is it possible
 to find between the different sounds of flutes, bells, human voices, and
 other instruments comparative relations which are precisely harmon
ic—so [precisely] that a more precise one could not be exhibited. Nor
 is there, in different instruments [of the same kind]—just as also not
 in different men—the same degree of true comparative relations;
 rather, in all things difference according to place, time, complexity,
 and other [considerations] is necessary. And so, precise comparative
 relation is seen only formally; and we cannot experience in percepti
ble objects a most agreeable, undefective harmony, because it is not
 present there. Ascend now to [the recognition] that the maximum,
 most precise harmony is an equality-of-comparative-relation which a
 living and bodily man cannot hear. For since [this harmony] is every
 proportion (ratio), it would attract to itself our soul's reason[ratio]—
 just as infinite Light [attracts] all light—so that the soul, freed from
 perceptible objects, would not without rapture hear with the intellect's
 ear this supremely concordant harmony. A certain immensely pleas
ant contemplation could here be engaged in—not only regarding the
 immortality of our intellectual, rational spirit (which harbors in its na
ture incorruptible reason, through which the mind attains, of itself, to
 the concordant and the discordant likeness in musical things). but also
 regarding the eternal joy into which the blessed are conducted, once
 they are freed from the things of this world. But [I will deal] with this
 [topic] elsewhere.5
 Furthermore: If we apply our rule to arithmetic, we see that no two
 things can agree in number. And since with respect to a difference of
 number there is also a difference of composition, complexity, com
parative relation, harmony, motion, and so on ad infinitum, we here
by recognize that we are ignorant.
 No one [human being] is as another in any respect—neither in sen
sibility, nor imagination, nor intellect, nor in an activity (whether writ
ing or painting or an art). Even if for a thousand years one [individ
ual] strove to imitate another in any given respect, he would never at
De Docta Ignorantia II, 1
 60
 tain precision (though perceptible difference sometimes remains un
perceived). Even art imitates nature as best it can; but it can never ar
rive at reproducing it precisely. Therefore, medicine as well as alche
my, magic, and other transmutational arts lacks true precision, al
though one art is truer in comparison with another (e.g., medicine is
 truer than the transmutational arts, as is self-evident).
 95
 96
 Let me say, still making inferences from the same basis: Since
 with regard to opposites (e.g., with regard to the simple and the com
posite, the abstract and the concrete, the formal and the material, the
 corruptible and the incorruptible, etc.) we also find degrees of com
parative greatness, we do not come to the pure oppositeness of the
 opposites—i.e., to that wherein they agree precisely and equally.
 Therefore, it is with a difference of degree that all things are from op
posites; they have more from one [of the opposites] and less from the
 other, and they receive the nature of one of them through the triumph
 of one [of them] over the other. Wherefore, we pursue the knowledge
 of things rationally, so that we may know that in one thing composi
tion is present in a certain simplicity and in another thing simplicity
 is present in composition, [that] in one thing corruptibility [is present]
 in incorruptibility and in another the reverse, and so on, as I shall ex
pound in the book of Conjectures, where I will discuss this [matter]
 more fully.6 Let these few remarks suffice for showing the marvelous
 power of learned ignorance.
 Descending more to the [present] topic, I say more fully: Since
 neither an ascent to the unqualifiedly Maximum nor a descent to the
 unqualifiedly Minimum is possible, and thus (as is evident regarding
 number and regarding the division of a continuum) no transition is
 made to the infinite:7 clearly, there must always be positable a greater
 and a lesser—whether in quantity or virtue or perfection, etc.—than
 any given finite thing, since the unqualifiedly Maximum or Minimum
 is not positable in [finite] things. But [this] progression does not con
tinue unto the infinite,8 as was just indicated. Since each part of the
 infinite is infinite, a contradiction is implied [by the following]: that
 where we reach the infinite, there we find more and less. For just as
 more and less cannot befit the infinite, so [they cannot befit] some
thing having any kind of comparative relation to the infinite, since,
 necessarily, this latter would also be infinite. For example, in the in
finite number the number two would not be smaller than the number
 one hundred—if through ascending we could actually arrive at the in
De Docta Ignorantia II, 1 - 2
 61
 finite number.9 Similarly, an infinite line composed of an infinite num
ber of lines of two feet would not be shorter than an infinite line com
posed of an infinite number of lines of four feet. And so, [by com
parison] there is not positable anything which would limit the Divine
 Power. Therefore, the Divine Power can posit a greater and a lesser
 than any given thing, unless this given thing is also the Absolute Max
imum—as will be demonstrated in the third book.10
 97
 98
 Therefore, only the absolutely Maximum is negatively infinite.
 Hence, it alone is whatever there can at all possibly be. But since the
 universe encompasses all the things which are not God, it cannot be
 negatively infinite, although it is unbounded and thus privatively in
finite. And in this respect it is neither finite nor infinite. For it cannot
 be greater than it is. This results from a defect. For its possibility, or
 matter, does not extend itself farther. For to say “The universe can al
ways be actually greater” is not other than saying “Possible being
 passes over into actually infinite being.” But this latter [statement]
 cannot hold true, since infinite actuality—which is absolute eternity,
 which is actually all possibility of being—cannot arise from possibil
ity.11 Therefore, although with respect to God's infinite power, which
 is unlimitable, the universe could have been greater: nevertheless,
 since the possibility-of-being, or matter, which is not actually ex
tendible unto infinity, opposes, the universe cannot be greater. And
 so, [the universe is] unbounded; for it is not the case that anything
 actually greater than it, in relation to which it would be bounded, is
 positable. And so, [it is] privatively infinite. Now, the universe exists
 actually only in a contracted manner, so that it exists in the best12 way
 in which the condition of its nature allows. For it is the creation,
 which, necessarily, derives from Absolute and unqualifiedly Divine
 Being—as subsequently and by means of learned ignorance I will very
 briefly show, as clearly and simply as possible.
 Chapter Two: Created being derives from the being of the
 First in a way that is not understandable.
 Sacred ignorance has already13 taught us that nothing exists from it
self except the unqualifiedly Maximum (in which from itself, in itself,
 through itself, and with respect to itself are the same thing: viz., Ab
solute Being) and that, necessarily, every existing thing is that which
 it is, insofar as it is, from Absolute Being. For how could that which
De Docta Ignorantia II, 2
 62
 is not from itself exist in any other way than from Eternal Being? But
 since the Maximum is far distant from any envy, it cannot impart di
minished being as such. Therefore, a created thing, which is a deriv
ative being, does not have everything which it is (e.g., [not] its cor
ruptibility, divisibility, imperfection, difference, plurality, and the like)
 from the eternal, indivisible, most perfect, undifferentiated, and one
 Maximum—nor from any positive cause.

 100
 An infinite line is infinite straightness, which is the cause of all
 linear being. Now, with respect to being a line, a curved line is from
 the infinite line; but with respect to being curved, it is not from the
 infinite line. Rather, the curvature follows upon finitude, since a line
 is curved because it is not the maximum line. For if it were the max
imum line, it would not be curved, as was shown previously.14 Sim
ilarly with things: since they cannot be the Maximum, it happens that
 they are diminished, other differentiated, and the like—none of which
 [characteristics] have a cause. Therefore, a created thing has from God
 the fact that it is one, distinct, and united to the universe; and the more
 it is one, the more like15 unto God it is. However, it does not have
 from God (nor from any positive cause but [only] contingently16) the
 fact that its oneness exists in plurality, its distinctness in confusion,
 and its union in discord.
 Who, then, can understand created being by conjoining, in creat
ed being, the absolute necessity from which it derives and the con
tingency without which it does not exist? For it seems that the cre
ation, which is neither God17 nor nothing, is, as it were, after God
 and before nothing and in between God and nothing—as one of the
 sages says: “God is the opposition to nothing by the mediation of
 being.”18 Nevertheless, [the creation] cannot be composed of being
 and not-being. Therefore, it seems neither to be (since it descends from
 being) nor not to be (since it is before nothing) nor to be a compos
ite of being and nothing.
 Now, our intellect, which cannot leap beyond contradictories,19
 does not attain to the being of the creation either by means of divi
sion or of composition, although it knows that created being derives
 only from the being of the Maximum. Therefore, derived being is not
 understandable, because the Being from which [it derives] is not un
derstandable—just as the adventitious being of an accident is not un
derstandable if the substance to which it is adventitious is not under
stood.20 And, therefore, the creation as creation cannot be called one,
De Docta Ignorantia II, 2
 63
 because it descends from Oneness, nor [can it be called] many, since
 its being derives from the One; nor [can it be called] both one and
 many conjunctively. But its oneness exists contingently and with a cer
tain plurality. Something similar, it seems, must be said about sim
plicity and composition and other opposites.
 101
 102
 103
 But since the creation was created through the being of the Max
imum and since—in the Maximum—being, making, and creating are
 the same thing: creating seems to be not other than God's being all
 things. Therefore, if God is all things and if His being all things is
 creating: how can we deem the creation not to be eternal, since God's
 being is eternal—indeed, is eternity itself? Indeed, insofar as the cre
ation is God's being no one doubts that it is eternity. Therefore, inso
far as it is subject to time, it is not from God, who is eternal. Who,
 then, understands the creation's existing both eternally and temporal
ly? For in21 Being itself the creation was not able not to exist eter
nally; nor was it able to exist before time, since “before” time there
 was no before.22 And so, the creation always existed, from the time it
 was able to exist.
 Who, in fact, can understand that God is the Form of being and
 nevertheless is not mingled with the creation? For from an infinite line
 and a finite curved line there cannot arise a composite, which cannot
 exist without comparative relation; but no one doubts that there can
 be no comparative relation between the infinite and the finite.23 How,
 then, can the intellect grasp the following?: that the being of a curved
 line is from an infinite straight line, though the infinite straight line
 does not inform the curved line as a form but rather as a cause and
 an essence. The curved line cannot participate in this essence either by
 taking a part of it (since the essence is infinite and indivisible) or as
 matter participates in form (e.g., as Socrates and Plato [participate] in
 humanity), or as a whole is participated in by its parts (e.g., as the uni
verse [is participated in] by its parts), or as several mirrors [partake
 of] the same face in different ways (for it is not the case that as a mir
ror is a mirror before it receives the image of a face, so created being
 exists prior to derivative, [participating] being; for created being is103
 derivative being). Who is he, then, who can understand how it is that
 the one, infinite Form is participated in in different ways by different
 created things? For created being cannot be anything other than re
flection—not a reflection received positively in some other thing but
 a reflection which is contingently different. Perhaps [a comparison
De Docta Ignorantia II, 2
 64
 with an artifact is fitting]: if the artifact depended entirely upon the
 craftman's idea and did not have any other being than dependent being,
 the artifact would exist from the craftsman and would be conserved
 as a result of his influence—analogously to the image of a face in a
 mirror (with the proviso that before and after [the appearance of the
 image] the mirror be nothing in and of itself).
 Nor can we understand how it is that God can be made manifest
 to us through visible creatures. For [God is] not [manifest] analogously
 to our intellect, which is known only to God and to ourselves and
 which, when it commences to think, receives from certain images in
 the memory a form of a color, a sound, or something else. Prior [to
 this reception] the intellect was without form, and subsequently there
to it assumes another form—whether of signs, utterances, or letters—
 and manifests itself to others [besides itself and God]. Although God—
 whether in order to make His goodness known (as the religious main
tain), or because of the fact that [He is] maximum, absolute Necessi
ty, or for some other reason—created the world, which obeys Him (so
 that there are those who are compelled and who fear Him and whom
 He judges), it is evident that He neither assumes another form (since
 He is the Form of all forms) nor appears through positive signs (since
 these signs themselves, in regard to their own being, would likewise
 require other signs through which [to appear], and so on ad infinitum).
 104
 Who could understand the following?: how all things are the
 image of that one, infinite Form and are different contingently—as if
 a created thing were a god manqué, just as an accident is a substance
 manqué, and a woman is a man manqué.24 For the Infinite Form is
 received only finitely, so that every created thing is, as it were, a fi
nite infinity or a created god,25 so that it exists in the way in which
 this can best occur.26 [Everything is] as if the Creator had said, “Let
 it be made,” and as if because a God (who is eternity itself) could not
 be made, there was made that which could be made: viz., something
 as much like God as possible.27 Wherefore, we infer that every cre
ated thing qua created thing is perfect—even if it seems less perfect
 in comparison with some other [created thing]. For the most gracious
 God imparts being to all things, in the manner in which being can be
 received. Therefore, since He imparts without difference and envy and
 since [what is imparted] is received in such way that contingency does
 not allow it to be received otherwise or to a greater degree: every cre
ated being finds satisfaction in its own perfection, which it has from
 the Divine Being freely. It does not desire to be, as something more
De Docta Ignorantia II, 2 - 3
 65
 perfect, any other created thing.28 Rather, it prefers that which it it
self has, as a divine gift, from the Maximum; and it wishes for this
 [gift] to be incorruptibly perfected and preserved.
 105
 106
 Chapter Three: In a way that cannot be understood the
 Maximum enfolds and unfolds all things.
 Nothing not enfolded in the first part [i.e., Book One] can be stated
 or thought about the ascertainable truth. For, necessarily, everything
 that agrees with what was there stated about the First Truth is true;
 the rest, which disagrees, is false. Now, in Book One we find it indi
cated29 that there can be only one Maximum of all maxima. But the
 Maximum is that to which nothing can be opposed and in which even
 the Minimum is the Maximum.30 Therefore, Infinite Oneness is the
 enfolding of all things. Oneness, which unites all things, bespeaks this
 [enfolding of all things]. Oneness is maximal not simply because it is
 the enfolding of number but because [it is the enfolding] of all
 things.31 And just as in number, which is the unfolding of oneness,
 we find only oneness, so in all existing things we find only the Max
imum.
 With respect to quantity, which is the unfolding of oneness, one
ness is said to be a point. For in quantity only a point is present. Just
 as everywhere in a line—no matter where you divide it—there is a
 point, so [the same thing holds true] for a surface and a material ob
ject. And yet, there is not more than one point. This one point is not
 anything other than infinite oneness; for infinite oneness is a point
 which is the end, the perfection, and the totality of line and quantity,
 which it enfolds. The first unfolding of the point is the line, in which
 only the point is present.
 In like manner, if you consider [the matter] carefully: rest is one
ness which enfolds motion, and motion is rest ordered serially.Hence,
 motion is the unfolding of rest. In like manner, the present, or the now,
 enfolds time. The past was the present, and the future will become
 the present. Therefore, nothing except an ordered present is found in
 time. Hence, the past and the future are the unfolding of the present.
 The present is the enfolding of all present times; and the present times
 are the unfolding, serially, of the present; and in the present times only
 the present is found. Therefore, the present is one enfolding of all
 times. Indeed, the present is. oneness. In like manner, identity is the
De Docta Ignorantia II, 3
 66
 enfolding of difference; equality [the enfolding] of inequality; and
 simplicity [the enfolding] of divisions, or distinctions.
 107
 108
 109
 Therefore, there is one enfolding of all things. The enfolding of
 substance, the enfolding of quality or of quantity, and so on, are not
 distinct enfoldings. For there is only one Maximum, with which the
 Minimum coincides and in which enfolded32 difference is not opposed
 to enfolding identity. Just as oneness precedes otherness,33 so also a
 point, which is a perfection, [precedes] magnitude. For what is per
fect precedes whatever is imperfect. Thus, rest [precedes] motion,
 identity [precedes] difference, equality [precedes] inequality, and so on
 regarding the other perfections. These are convertible with Oneness,
 which is Eternity itself (for there cannot be a plurality of eternal
 things).34 Therefore, God is the enfolding of all things in that all things
 are in Him; and He is the unfolding of all things in that He is in all
 things.
 To explain my meaning by numerical examples: Number is the un
folding of oneness. Now, number bespeaks reasoning. But reasoning
 is from a mind. Therefore, the brutes, which do not have a mind, are
 unable to number.35 Therefore, just as number arises from our mind
 by virtue of the fact that we understand what is commonly one as in
dividually many: so the plurality of things [arises] from the Divine
 Mind (in which the,many are present without plurality, because they
 are present in Enfolding Oneness). For in accordance with the fact that
 things cannot participate equally in the Equality of Being: God, in
 eternity, understood one thing in one way and another thing in anoth
er way. Herefrom arose plurality, which in God is oneness. Now, plu
rality or number does not have any other being than as comes from
 oneness. Therefore, oneness, without which number would not be
 number,36 is present in the plurality. And, indeed, this [is what it] is
 for oneness to unfold all things: viz., for it to be present in the plu
rality.37
 However, the mode of enfolding and unfolding surpasses [the
 measure of] our mind. Who, I ask, could understand how it is that the
 plurality of things is from the Divine Mind? For God's understanding
 is His being; for God is Infinite Oneness. If you proceed with the nu
merical comparison by considering that number is the multiplication,
 by the mind, of the common one: it seems as if God, who is Oneness,
 were multiplied in things, since His understanding is His being.38 And,
 yet, you understand that this Oneness, which is infinite and maximal,
De Docta Ignorantia II, 3
 67
 110
 111
 cannot be multiplied. How, then, can you understand there to be a plu
rality whose being comes from the One without [there occurring] any
 multiplication of the One? That is, how can you understand there to
 be a multiplication of Oneness without there being a multiplication [of
 Oneness]? Surely, [you can] not [understand it] as [you understand
 the multiplication] of one species or of one genus in many species or
 many individuals; outside of these [individuals] a genus or a species
 does not exist except through an abstracting intellect.39 Therefore, no
 one understands how God (whose oneness of being does not exist
 through the understanding's abstracting from things and does not exist
 as united to, or merged with, things) is unfolded through the number
 of things. If you consider things in their independence from God, they
 are nothing—even as number without oneness [is nothing]. If you con
sider God in His independence from things, He exists and the things
 are nothing. If you consider Him as He is in things, you consider
 things to be something in which He is. And in this regard you err, as
 was evident in the preceding chapter.40 For it is not the case that the
 being of a thing is another thing, as a different thing is [another thing];
 rather, its being is derivative being. If you consider a thing as it is in
 God, it is God and Oneness.
 There remains only to say that the plurality of things arises from
 the fact that God is present in nothing. For take away God from the
 creation and nothing remains. Take away substance from a composite
 and no accident remains; and so, nothing remains. How can our in
tellect fathom this? For although an accident perishes when the sub
stance is removed, an accident is not therefore nothing. However, the
 accident perishes because its being is adventitious being. And hence,
 a quantity, for example, exists only through the being of a substance;
 nevertheless, because quantity is present, the substance is quantitative
 by virtue of quantity. But [the relationship between God and the cre
ation is] not similar. For the creation is not adventitious to God in a
 correspondingly similar manner; for it does not confer anything on
 God, as an accident [confers something] on a substance. Indeed, an ac
cident confers [something] on a substance to such an extent that, as a
 result, the substance cannot exist without some accident, even though
 the accident derives its own being from the substance. But with God
 a similar thing cannot hold true. How, then, can we understand the
 creation qua creation?—[a creation] which is from God but which can
not as a result thereof contribute anything at all to Him, who is the
 greatest. And if qua creation it does not have even as much being as
De Docta Ignorantia II, 3 - 4
 68
 an accident but is altogether nothing, how can we understand that the
 plurality of things is unfolded by virtue of the fact that God is pres
ent in nothing? For nothing [or not-being] is without any being. You
 might reply: “God's omnipotent will is the cause; His will and om
nipotence are His being; for the whole of theology is circular.”41 If so,
 then you will have to admit that you are thoroughly ignorant of how
 enfolding and unfolding occur and that you know only that you do
 not know the manner, even if you know (1) that God is the enfolding
 and the unfolding of all things, (2) that insofar as He is the enfold
ing, in Him all things are Himself, and (3) that insofar as He is the
 unfolding, in all things He is that which they are, just as in an image
 the reality itself (veritas) is present.42 [It is] as if a face were present
 in its own image, which, depending upon its repeatedness, is a close
 or a distant multiple of the face. (I do not mean according to spatial
 distance but according to a progressive difference from the real face,
 since [the image] cannot be repeated in any other way [than with a dif
ference].) [It is as if] the one face—while remaining incomprehensi
bly above all the senses and every mind—were to appear differently
 and manifoldly in the different images multiplied from it.

 Chapter Four: The universe, which is only a contracted
 maximum, is a likeness of the
 Absolute [Maximum].
 If by careful consideration we extend what was previously manifest
ed to us through learned ignorance: from the sole fact of our know
ing that all things are either the Absolute Maximum or from the Ab
solute Maximum, many points can become clear to us regarding the
 world, or universe, which I affirm to be only a contracted maximum.
 Since what is contracted, or concrete, has from the Absolute whatev
er it is, that which is the [contracted] maximum imitates the maximally
 Absolute as much as it can. Therefore, [regarding] those things which
 in Book One were made known to us about the Absolute Maximum:
 as they befit the maximally Absolute absolutely,43 so I affirm that they
 befit in a contracted way what is contracted.
 Let me present some examples in order to prepare an inroad for
 one who is inquiring. God is Absolute Maximality and Oneness,, who
 precedes and unites absolutely different and separate things—i.e., con
tradictories—between which there is no middle ground. Absolute
 Maximality is, absolutely, that which all things are: in all things it is
De Docta Ignorantia II, 4
 69
 the Absolute Beginning of things, the [Absolute] End of things, and
 the [Absolute] Being of things; in it44 all things are—indistinctly, most
 simply, and without plurality—the Absolute Maximum, just as an in
finite line is all figures.45 So likewise the world, or universe,46 is a
 contracted maximum and a contracted one. The world precedes con
tracted opposites—i.e., contraries. And it is, contractedly, that which
 all things are: in all things it is the contracted beginning of things, the
 contracted end of things, and the contracted being of things; it is a con
tracted infinity and thus is contractedly infinite; in it all things are—
 with contracted simplicity and contracted indistinction and without
 plurality47—the contracted maximum, just as a contracted maximum
 line is contractedly all figures.
 114
 115
 Hence, when one rightly considers contraction, the whole matter
 becomes clear. For contracted infinity, simplicity, or indistinction is.,
 with regard to its contraction, infinitely lower than what is absolute,
 so that the infinite and eternal world48 falls disproportionally short of
 Absolute Infinity and Absolute Eternity,49 and [so that] the one [falls
 disproportionally short] of Oneness. Hence, Absolute Oneness is free
 of all plurality. But although contracted oneness (which is the one uni
verse) is one maximum: since it is contracted, it is not free of plural
ity, even though it is only one contracted maximum. Therefore, al
though it is maximally one, its oneness is contracted through plurali
ty, just as its infinity [is contracted] through finitude, its simplicity
 through composition, its eternity through succession, its necessity
 through possibility, and so on—as if Absolute Necessity communi
cated itself without any intermingling and yet necessity were con
tractedly restricted in something opposed to it. [For example, it is] as
 if whiteness had, in itself, absolute being apart from any abstracting
 on the part of our intellect, and as if what is white were contractedly
 white from whiteness; in this case whiteness would be restricted by
 non-whiteness in something actually white, so that that which would
 not be white without whiteness is white through whiteness.
 From these [observations] an inquirer can infer many points. For
 example, just as God, since He is immense, is neither in the sun nor
 in the moon, although in them He is, absolutely, that which they are:
 so the universe is neither in the sun nor in the moon; but in them it
 is, contractedly, that which they are. Now, the Absolute Quiddity of the
 sun is not other than the Absolute Quiddity of the moon (since [this]
 is God Himself, who is the Absolute Being and Absolute Quiddity of
De Docta Ignorantia II, 4
 70
 all things); but the contracted quiddity of the sun is other than the con
tracted quiddity of the moon (for as the Absolute Quiddity of a thing
 is not the thing, so the contracted [quiddity of a thing] is none other
 than the thing). Therefore, [the following] is clear: that since the uni
verse is contracted quiddity, which is contracted in one way in the sun
 and in another way in the moon, the identity of the universe exists in
 difference, just as its oneness exists in plurality. Hence, although the
 universe is neither the sun nor the moon, nevertheless in the sun it is
 the sun and in the moon it is the moon. However, it is not the case
 that God is in the sun sun and in the moon moon;50 rather, [in them]
 He is that which is sun and moon without plurality and difference. Uni
verse bespeaks universality—i.e., a oneness of many things. Accord
ingly, just as humanity is neither Socrates nor Plato but in Socrates is
 Socrates and in Plato is Plato, so is the universe in relation to all things.
 116
 But since, as was said, the universe is only the contracted first,51
 and in this respect is a maximum, it is evident that the whole universe
 sprang into existence by a simple emanation52 of the contracted max
imum from the Absolute Maximum. But all the beings which are parts
 of the universe (and without which the universe, since it is contract
ed, could not be one and whole and perfect) sprang into existence to
gether with the universe; [there was] not first an intelligence, then a
 noble soul, and then nature. as Avicenna53 and other philosophers
 maintained. Nevertheless, just as in a craftsman's design the whole
 (e.g., a house) is prior to a part (e.g., a wall), so because all things
 sprang into existence from God's design, we say that first there ap
peared the universe and thereafter all things—without which there
 could not be either a universe or a perfect [universe]. Hence, just as
 the abstract is in the concrete, so we consider the Absolute Maximum
 to be antecedently in the contracted maximum, so that it is subse
quently in all particulars because it is present absolutely in that which
 is contractedly all things [viz., in the universe]. For God is the Ab
solute Quiddity of the world, or universe. But the universe is con
tracted quiddity.54 Contraction means contraction to [i.e., restriction
 by] something, so as to be this or that. Therefore, God, who is one, is
 in the one universe. But the universe is contractedly in all things. And
 so, we can understand the following: (1) how it is that God, who is
 most simple Oneness and exists in the one universe, is in all things
 as if subsequently and through the mediation of the universe, and (2)
 [how it is that as it] through the mediation of the one universe the
 plurality of things is in God.
De Docta Ignorantia II, 5
 71
 117
 118
 Chapter Five: Each thing in each thing.
 If you pay close attention to what has already been said, you will not
 have trouble seeing—perhaps more deeply than Anaxagoras—the
 basis of the Anaxagorean truth “Each thing is in each thing.”55 From
 Book One it is evident that God is in all things in such way that all
 things are in Him;56 and it is now evident [from II, 4] that God is in
 all things through the mediation of the universe, as it were. Hence, it
 is evident that all is in all and each in each. For the universe, as being
 most perfect, preceded all things “in the order of nature,” as it were,
 so that in each thing it could be each thing. For in each created thing
 the universe is this created thing; and each thing receives all things
 in such way that in a given thing all things are, contractedly, this thing.
 Since each thing is contracted, it is not the case that it can be actual
ly all things; hence, it contracts all things, so that [in it] they are it.
 Therefore, if all things are in all things, all things seem to precede each
 given thing. Therefore, it is not the case that all things are many things,
 since it is not the case that plurality precedes each given thing. Hence,
 in the “order of nature,” [as it were] all things preceded, without plu
rality, each thing. Therefore, it is not the case that many things are in
 each thing actually; rather, [in each thing] all things are, without plu
rality, this respective thing.
 Now, the universe is in things only contractedly; and every actu
ally existing thing contracts all things, so that they are, actually, that
 which it is. But everything which exists actually, exists in God, since
 He is the actuality of all things. Now, actuality is the perfection and
 the end of possibility. Hence, since the universe is contracted in each
 actually existing thing: it is evident that God, who is in the universe,
 is in each thing and that each actually existing thing is immediately
 in God, as is also the universe.57 Therefore, to say that each thing is
 in each thing is not other than [to say] that through all things God is
 in all things and that through all things all things are in God.58 The
 following very deep [truths] are apprehended clearly by an acute in
tellect: that God is, without difference, in all things because each thing
 is in each thing and that all things are in God because all things are
 in all things. But since the universe is in each thing in such way that
 each thing is in it: in each thing the universe is, contractedly, that
 which this thing is contractedly; and in the universe each thing is the
 universe; nonetheless, the universe is in each thing in one way, and
 each thing is in the universe in another way.

 De Docta Ignorantia II, 5
 119
 120
 121
 Consider an example: It is evident that an infinite line is a line, a
 triangle, a circle, and a sphere.59 Now, every finite line has its being
 from the infinite line, which is all that which the finite line is.60 There
fore, in the finite line all that which the infinite line is—viz., line, tri
angle, and the others—is that which the finite line is. Therefore, in
 the finite line every figure is the finite line. In the finite line there is
 not actually either a triangle, a circle, or a sphere; for from what is
 actually many, there is not made what is actually one. For it is not the
 case that each thing is in each thing actually; rather, in the line the
 triangle is the line; and in the line the circle is the line; and so on. In
 order that you may see more clearly: A line cannot exist actually ex
cept in a material object, as will be shown elsewhere.61 Now, no one
 doubts that all figures are enfolded in a material object, which has
 length, width, and depth. Therefore, in an actually existing line all fig
ures are actually the line; and in [an actually existing] triangle [all fig
ures are] the triangle; and so on. In a stone all things are stone; in a
 vegetative soul, vegetative soul; in life, life; in the senses, the senses;
 in sight, sight; in hearing, hearing; in imagination, imagination; in rea
son, reason; in intellect, intellect;62 in God, God. See, then, how it is
 that the oneness of things, or the universe, exists in plurality and, con
versely, the plurality [of things] exists in oneness.
 Consider more closely and you will see that each actually exist
ing thing is tranquil because of the fact that in it all things are it and
 that in God it is God. You see that there is a marvelous oneness of
 things, an admirable equality, and a most wonderful union,63 so that
 all things are in all things. You also understand that for this reason
 there arises a difference and a union of things. For it is not the case
 that each thing was able to be actually all things (for each would have
 been God, and consequently all things would [actually] exist in each
 thing in the way in which they would be possible to exist con
formably with that which each thing is); and, as was evident above,64
 [it is] not [the case that] each thing was able to be altogether like the
 other. This, then, caused all things to exist in different degrees, just
 as it also caused that being which was unable to exist incorruptibly
 at once, to exist incorruptibly65 in temporal succession, so that all
 things are that which they are because they were not able to exist in
 any other way or any better way.66 Therefore, in each thing all things
 are tranquil, since one degree could not exist without another—just
 as with the members of a body each contributes [something] to the
 other, and all are content in all. For since the eye cannot actually be
De Docta Ignorantia II, 5 - 6
 73
 the hands, the feet, and all the other members, it is content with being
 the eye; and the foot [is content with being] the foot.67 And all mem
bers contribute [something] to one another, so that each is that which
 it is in the best way it can be. Neither the hand nor the foot is in the
 eye; but in the eye they are the eye insofar as the eye is immediately
 in the man. And in like manner, in the foot all the members [are the
 foot] insofar as the foot is immediately in the man. Thus, each mem
ber through each member is immediately in the man; and the man, or
 the whole, is in each member through each member, just as in the parts
 the whole is in each part through each part.
 122
 123
 Therefore, suppose you consider humanity as if it were something
 absolute, unmixable, and incontractible-, and [suppose you] consider
 a man in whom absolute humanity exists absolutely and from which
 humanity68 there exists the contracted humanity which the man is. In
 that case, the absolute humanity is, as it were, God; and the contract
ed humanity is, as it were, the universe. The absolute humanity is in
 the man principally, or antecedently, and is in each member or each
 part subsequently; and the contracted humanity is in the eye eye, in
 the heart heart, etc., and so, in each member is contractedly each mem
ber. Thus, in accordance with this supposition, we have found (1) a
 likeness of God and the world, and (2) guidance with respect to all
 the points touched upon in these two chapters, together with (3) many
 other points which follow from this [comparison].
 Chapter Six: The enfolding, and the degrees of
 contraction, of the universe.
 In the foregoing we found, beyond all understanding, that the world,
 or universe, is one. Its oneness is contracted by plurality, so that it is
 oneness in plurality. And because Absolute Oneness is first and the
 oneness of the universe is derived from it, the oneness of the universe
 will be a second oneness, consisting of a plurality. And since (as I
 will show in Conjectures)69 the second oneness is tenfold and unites
 the ten categories, the one universe will, by a tenfold contraction, be
 the unfolding of the first, absolute, and simple Oneness. Now, all
 things are enfolded in the number ten, since there is not a number
 above it.70 Therefore, the tenfold oneness of the universe enfolds the
 plurality of all contracted things. As ten is the square root of one hun
dred and the cube root of one thousand, so—because the oneness of
 the universe is in all things as the contracted beginning of all—the
De Docta Ignorantia II, 6
 74
 oneness of the universe is the root of all things. From this root there
 first arises the “square number,” so to speak, as a third oneness; and
 the cubic number [arises thereafter] as a fourth and final oneness. The
 first unfolding of the oneness of the universe is the third oneness, viz.,
 one hundred; and the last unfolding is the fourth oneness, viz., one
 thousand.
 124
 125
 And so, we find three universal onenesses descending by degrees
 to what is particular, in which they are contracted, so that they are ac
tually the particular. The first and absolute Oneness enfolds all things
 absolutely; the first contracted [oneness enfolds] all things contract
edly. But order requires [the following]: that Absolute Oneness be seen
 to enfold, as it were, the first contracted [oneness], so that by means
 of it [it enfolds] all other things; that the first contracted [oneness] be
 seen to enfold the second contracted [oneness] and, by means of it, the
 third contracted [oneness]; and that the second contracted [oneness be
 seen to enfold] the third contracted oneness, which is the last univer
sal oneness, fourth from the first, so that by means of the third con
tracted oneness the second oneness arrives at what is particular. And
 so, we see that the universe is contracted in each particular through
 three grades. Therefore, the universe is, as it were, all of the ten cat
egories [generalissima], then the genera, and then the species. And
 so, these are universal according to their respective degrees; they exist
 with degrees and prior, by a certain order of nature, to the thing which
 actually contracts them. And since the universe is contracted, it is not
 found except as unfolded in genera; and genera are found only in
 species.71 But individuals exist actually; in them all things exist con
tractedly. Through these considerations we see that universals exist
 actually only in a contracted manner. And in this way the Peripatetics
 speak the truth [when they say that] universals do not actually exist
 independently of things. For only what is particular exists actually. In
 the particular, universals are contractedly the particular. Nevertheless,
 in the order of nature universals have a certain universal being which
 is contractible by what is particular. [I do] not [mean] that before con
traction they exist actually and in some way other than according to
 the natural order ([i.e., other than] as a contractible universal which
 exists not in itself but in that which is actual, just as a point, a line,
 and a surface precede, in progressive order, the material object in
 which alone they exist actually). For because the universe exists ac
tually only in a contracted way, so too do all universals. Although uni
versals do not exist as actual apart from particulars, nevertheless they
De Docta Ignorantia II, 6 - 7
 75
 are not mere rational entities.72 (By comparison, although neither a
 line nor a surface exists apart from a material object, they are not on
 this account mere rational entities; for they exist in material objects,
 even as universals exist in particulars.) Nevertheless, by [the process
 of] abstracting, the intellect makes them exist independently of things.
 To be sure, the abstraction is a rational entity, since absolute being can
not befit universals. For the altogether absolute universal is God.
 126
 127
 We shall see in the book Conjectures how it is that the universal
 is in the intellect as a result of the [process of] abstracting.73 Yet, this
 point can be clearly enough seen from the preceding, since in the in
tellect the universal is only the intellect; and so, it is present there in
tellectually and contractedly. Since the intellect's understanding is both
 loftier and more illustrious being, it apprehends, both in itself and in
 other things, the contraction of universals. For example, dogs and the
 other animals of the same species are united by virtue of the common
 specific nature which is in them. This nature would be contracted in
 them even if Plato's intellect had not, from a comparison of likeness
es, formed for itself a species. Therefore, with respect to its own op
eration, understanding follows being and living; for [merely] through
 its own operation understanding can bestow neither being nor living
 nor understanding. Now, with respect to the things understood: the in
tellect's understanding follows, through a likeness, being and living
 and the intelligibility of nature. Therefore, universals, which it makes
 from comparison, are a likeness of the universals contracted in things.
 Universals exist contractedly in the intellect before the intellect un
folds them by outward signs for them—unfolds them through under
standing, which is its operation. For it can understand nothing which
 is not already contractedly in it as it. Therefore, in understanding, it
 unfolds, by resembling signs and characters, a certain resembling
 world, which is contracted in it.
 I have here said enough about the oneness of the universe and
 about its contraction in things. Let me add some points about its trin
ity.
 Chapter Seven: The trinity of the universe.
 Absolute Oneness is necessarily trine—not contractedly but absolute
ly; for Absolute Oneness is not other than Trinity, which we grasp
 more readily by means of a certain mutual relationship. (I discussed
De Docta Ignorantia II, 7
 76
 this point adequately in Book One.)74 Similarly, just as maximum con
tracted oneness is oneness, so it is trine—not absolutely, so that the
 trinity is oneness, but contractedly, so that the oneness exists only in
 trinity, as a whole exists contractedly in its parts. In God it is not the
 case that Oneness exists contractedly in Trinity as a whole exists [con
tractedly] in its parts or as a universal exists [contractedly] in partic
ulars; rather, the Oneness is the Trinity. Therefore, each of the per
sons [of the Trinity] is the Oneness; and since the Oneness is Trinity,
 one person is not another person. But in the case of the universe a sim
ilar thing cannot hold true. Therefore, [in the case of the universe] the
 three mutual relationships—which in God are called persons—have
 actual existence only collectively in oneness.
 128
 129
 We must consider the foregoing points carefully. For in God the
 perfection of Oneness, which is Trinity, is so great that the Father is
 actually God, the Son actually God, and the Holy Spirit actually God,
 the Son and the Holy Spirit are actually in the Father, the Son and the
 Father [are actually] in the Holy Spirit, and the Father and the Holy
 Spirit [are actually] in the Son. But in the case of what is contracted,
 a similar thing cannot hold true; for the mutual relationships exist per
 se only conjointly. Therefore, it cannot be the case that each distinct
 relationship is the universe; rather, all the mutual relationships [are]
 collectively [the universe]. Nor is the one [of them] actually in the oth
ers; rather, they are most perfectly contracted to one another (in the
 way in which the condition of contraction permits this), so that from
 them there is one universe,75 which could not be one without that trin
ity. For there cannot be contraction without (1) that which is con
tractible, (2) that which causes contracting, and (3) the union which
 is effected through the common actuality of these two.
 But contractibility bespeaks a certain possibility; and this [possi
bility] is descendant from the Begetting Oneness in God, Just as oth
erness [is descendant] from Oneness.76 For [contracted possibility]77
 bespeaks mutability and otherness,78 since [it speaks] with regard to
 a beginning .79 For not anything it seems, precedes possibility. For
 how would anything exist if it had not been possible to exist? There
fore, possibility is descendant from Eternal Oneness.
 But since that which causes contracting delimits the possibility of
 that which is contractible, it descends from Equality of Oneness. For
 Equality of Oneness is Equality of Being. For being and one are con
vertible. Hence, since that which causes contracting equalizes the pos
De Docta Ignorantia II, 7
 77
 sibility for being one thing or another contractedly, it is rightly said
 to descend from Equality-of-Being, which, in God, is the Word. And
 since the Word, which is the Essence (ratio) and Idea and Absolute
 Necessity of things, necessitates and restricts the possibility through
 such a cause of contracting, some [thinkers] called that which causes
 contracting “form” or “the world-soul” (and they called possibility
 “matter”); others [spoke of it as] “fate substantified”; others, e.g., the
 Platonists, [spoke of it as] a “connecting necessity.” For it descends
 from Absolute Necessity, so that it is a contracted necessity and con
tracted form, as it were, in which all forms truly exist. This [topic] will
 be discussed later.80
 130
 131
 Next, there is the union of what is contractible and what causes
 contracting—i.e., [the union] of matter and form, or of possibility and
 connecting necessity. This union is actually effected as if by a spirit
 of love—[a love] which unites the two by means of a certain motion.
 Certain individuals were accustomed to call this union “determined
 possibility.” For the possibility-to-be is determined toward actually
 being this or that—[determined] by means of the union of the deter
mining form and the determinable matter. But, clearly, this union de
scends from the Holy Spirit, who is Infinite Union.
 Therefore, the oneness of the universe is three, since it is from
 possibility, connecting necessity, and union-which can be called pos
sibility, actuality, and union.81 And herefrom infer four universal
 modes of being. There is the mode of being which is called Absolute
 Necessity, according as God is Form of forms, Being of beings, and
 Essence (ratio) or Quiddity of things. With regard to this mode of
 being: in God all things are Absolute Necessity itself. Another mode
 [of being] is according as things exist in the connecting necessity; in
 this necessity, just as in a mind, the forms-of-things, true in them
selves, exist with a distinction, and an order, of nature. We shall see
 later whether this is so.82 Another mode of being is according as, in
 determined possibility, things are actually this or that. And the lowest
 mode of being is according as things are possible to be, and it is ab
solute possibility.83
 The last three modes of being exist in one universality which is a
 contracted maximum.84 From these there is one universal mode of
 being, since without them not anything can exist. I say modes of being.
 For the universal mode of being is not composed of the three things
 as parts in the way that a house [is composed] of a roof, a founda
78
 De Docta Ignorantia II, 7 - 8
 tion, and a wall. Rather it is from modes of being. For a rose which
 in a rose-garden is in potency in winter and in actuality in the sum
mer has passed from a mode of possible being to something actually
 determined. Hence, we see that the mode of being of possibility, the
 mode of being of necessity, and the mode of being of actual determi
nation are distinct. From them there is one universal mode of being,
 since without them there is nothing; nor does the one mode actually
 exist without the other.
 132
 133
 Chapter Eight: The possibility, or matter, of the universe.
 To expound here, at least briefly, upon the things which can make our
 ignorance learned, let me discuss for a moment the previously men
tioned three modes of being—beginning with possibility. The ancients
 made many statements about possibility; the opinion of them all was
 that from nothing nothing is made. And so, they maintained that there
 is a certain absolute possibility of being all things and that it is eter
nal. They believed that in absolute possibility all things are enfolded
 as possibilities. They conceived this [absolute] matter, or possibility,
 by reasoning in a reverse way, just as in the case of absolute necessi
ty. For example, they conceived a body incorporeally by abstracting
 from it the form of corporeity. And so, they attained unto matter only
 ignorantly. For how can a body be conceived incorporeally and with
out form? They said that by nature possibility precedes everything, so
 that the statement “God exists” is never true without the statement
 “Absolute possibility exists” also being true. Nevertheless, they did
 not maintain that absolute possibility is co-eternal with God, since it
 is from God. Absolute possibility is neither something nor nothing,
 neither one nor many, neither this nor that, neither quidditive nor qual
itative; rather, it is the possibility for all things and is, actually, noth
ing of all things.
 The Platonists called absolute possibility “lack,” since it lacks all
 form. Because it lacks, it desires. And by virtue of the following fact
 it is aptitude: viz., it obeys necessity, which commands it (i.e., draws
 it toward actually being), just as wax [obeys] the craftsman who wills
 to make something from it. But formlessness proceeds from, and
 unites, lack and aptitude—so that absolute possibility is, as it were, in
compositely trine. For lack, aptitude, and formlessness cannot be its
 parts; for if they were, something would precede85 absolute possibil
ity—which is impossible. Hence, [lack, aptitude, and formlessness] are
De Docta Ignorantia II, 8
 79
 modes in whose absence absolute possibility would not be abso  lute.
 For lack exists contingently in possibility. For from the fact that pos
sibility does not have the form it can have, it is said to be lacking.
 Hence, it is lack. But formlessness is the “form” (so to speak) of pos
sibility, which, as the Platonists maintained, is the “matter” (so to
 speak) of forms. For the world-soul is united to matter in accordance
 with formlessness, which they called “the basic power of life,” so that
 when the world-soul is mingled with possibility, the formless power
 of life is actually brought to the life-giving soul—brought (a) from a
 motion descending from the world-soul and (b) from the changeable
ness of possibility, or of power-of-life. Hence, they maintained that
 formlessness is the matter (so to speak) of forms—which matter is in
formed through sensitive, rational, and intellectual [form], so that it
 exists actually.
 134
 135
 Hence, Hermes86 said that hyle is the nourisher of bodies and that
 that formlessness is the nourisher of souls. And someone among us
 said that chaos naturally preceded the world and was the possibility
 of things—in which chaos that formless power resided, and in which
 power all souls exist as possibilities. Hence, the ancient Stoics said
 that all forms are actually in possibility but are hidden and appear as
 a result of a removal of the covering—just as when a spoon is made
 from wood only by the removal of portions [of the wood].87
 However, the Peripatetics said that forms are in matter only as
 possibilities and are educed by an efficient cause. Hence, it is quite
 true that forms exist not only from possibility but also through an ef
ficient cause. (For example, he who removes portions of a piece of
 wood, in order that a statue be made from it, adds with respect to
 form.) This is obvious. For the fact that from stone a chest cannot be
 made by a craftsman is a defect in the material. But the fact that some
one other than the craftsman cannot make a chest from wood is a de
fect in the agent. Therefore, both matter and an efficient cause are re
quired. Hence, in a certain way, forms are in matter as possibilities,
 and they are brought to actuality in conformity with an efficient
 cause.Thus, [the Peripatetics] said that the totality of things is present,
 as possibility, in absolute possibility. Absolute possibility is bound
less and infinite because of its lack of form and because of its apti
tude for all forms—just as the possibility of shaping wax into the fig
ure of a lion or a hare or whatever else, is boundless. Now, this in
finity contrasts with the infinity of God because it is due to a lack,
De Docta Ignorantia II, 8
 80
 whereas [the infinity] of God is due to an abundance, since in God
 all things are actually God. Thus, the infinity of matter is privative,
 [but the infinity] of God is negative. This is the position of those who
 have spoken about absolute possibility.
 136
 137
 138
 Through learned ignorance we find that it would be impossible
 for absolute possibility to exist. For since among things possible
 nothing can be less than absolute possibility, which is nearest to not
being (even according to the position of [earlier] writers), we would
 arrive at a minimum and a maximum with respect to things admit
ting of greater and lesser degrees; and this is impossible. Therefore,
 in God absolute possibility is God, but it is not possible outside Him.
 For we cannot posit anything which exists with absolute potency
 since everything except for the First is, necessarily, contracted.88 For
 if the different things in the world are found to be so related that
 more can be from the one than from the other, we do not arrive at
 the unqualifiedly and absolutely Maximum and Minimum. And be
cause they are found to be [such], absolute possibility is obvious
ly not positable. Therefore, every possibility is contracted. But it is
 contracted through actuality. Therefore, pure possibility—altogether
 undetermined by any actuality—is not to be found. Nor can the apti
tude of the possibility be infinite and absolute, devoid of all contrac
tion. For since God is Infinite Actuality, He is the cause only of ac
tuality.89 But the possibility of being exists contingently. Therefore,
 if the possibility were absolute, on what would it be contingent? Now,
 the possibility results from the fact that being [which derives] from the
 First cannot be completely, unqualifiedly, and absolutely actuality.
 Therefore, the actuality is contracted through the possibility, so that
 it does not at all exist except in the possibility. And the possibility does
 not at all exist unless it is contracted through the actuality. But there
 are differences and degrees, so that one thing is more actual, another
 more potential—without our coming to the unqualifiedly Maximum
 and Minimum. For maximum and minimum actuality coincide with
 maximum and minimum possibility and are the aforesaid absolutely
 Maximum, as was shown in Book One.90
 Furthermore, unless the possibility of things were contracted, there
 could not be a reason for things but everything would happen by
 chance, as Epicurus falsely maintained. That this world sprang forth
 rationally from possibility was necessarily due to the fact that the pos
sibility had an aptitude only for being this world. Therefore, the pos
81
 De Docta Ignorantia II, 8 - 9
 sibility's aptitude was contracted and not absolute. The same holds true
 regarding the earth, the sun, and other things: unless they had been
 latently present in matter—[present] in terms of a certain contracted
 possibility—there would have been no more reason why they would
 have been brought forth into actuality than not.
 139
 140
 141
 Hence, although God is infinite and therefore had the power to
 create the world as infinite, nevertheless because the possibility was,
 necessarily, contracted and was not at all absolute or infinite aptitude,
 the world—in accordance with the possibility of being—was not able
 to be actually infinite or greater or to exist in any other way [than it
 does]. Now, the contraction of possibility is from actuality; but the
 actuality is from Maximum Actuality. Therefore, since the contraction
 of possibility is from God and the contraction of actuality is the re
sult of contingency, the world—which, necessarily, is contracted—is
 contingently finite. Hence, from a knowledge of possibility we see
 how it is that contracted maximality comes from possibility which, of
 necessity, is contracted. This contraction [of possibility] does not re
sult from contingency, because it occurs through actuality. And so, the
 universe has a rational and necessary cause of its contraction, so that
 the world, which is only contracted being, is not contingently from
 God, who is Absolute Maximality. This [point] must be considered
 more in detail. Accordingly, since Absolute Possibility is God: if we
 consider the world as it is in Absolute Possibility, it is as [it is] in God
 and is Eternity itself.91 If we consider [the world] as it is in contract
ed possibility, then possibility, by nature, precedes only the world; and
 this contracted possibility is neither eternity nor co-eternal with God;
 rather, it falls short of eternity, as what is contracted [falls short] of
 what is absolute—the two being infinitely different.
 What is said about potency or possibility or matter needs to be
 qualified, in the foregoing manner, according to the rules of learned
 ignorance. How it is that possibility proceeds by steps to actuality, I
 leave to be dealt with in the book Conjectures.92
 Chapter Nine: The soul, or form, of the universe.
 All the wise agree that possible being cannot come to be actual ex
cept through actual being; for nothing can bring itself into actual
 being, lest it be the cause of itself; for it would be before it was.93
 Hence, they said that that which actualizes possibility does so inten
tionally, so that the possibility comes to be actual by rational ordina
De Docta Ignorantia II, 9
 82
 142
 143
 tion and not by chance. Some called this excellent [actualizing] na
ture “mind”; others called it “Intelligence,” others “world-soul,” oth
ers “fate substantified,” others (e.g., the Platonists) “connecting ne
cessity.” The Platonists thought that possibility is necessarily deter
mined through this necessity, so that possibility now actually is that
 which it was beforehand able to be by nature. For they said that in
 this mind the forms of things exist actually and intelligibly, just as in
 matter they exist as possibilities. And [they maintained] that the con
necting necessity—which contains in itself the truth of the forms, to
gether with [the truth of] the things which accompany the forms moves
 the heavens in accordance with the order of nature, so that by the
 medium of motion as an instrument [the connecting necessity] brings
 possibility into actuality and, as conformably as can be, into congru
ence with the intelligible concept of truth. The Platonists conceded that
 form as it is in matter—through this activity of the [world]-mind and
 by the medium of motion—is the image of true intelligible form and
 so is not true form but a likeness. Thus, the Platonists said that the true
 forms are in the world-soul prior—not temporally but naturally—to
 their presence in things. The Peripatetics do not grant this [point], for
 they maintain that forms do not have any other existence than in mat
ter and (as a result of abstracting) in the intellect. (Obviously, the ab
straction is subsequent to the thing.)
 However, [the following view] was acceptable to the Platonists:
 that such a distinct plurality of exemplars in the connecting necessity
 is—in a natural order—from one infinite Essence, in which all things
 are one. Nevertheless, they did not believe that the exemplars were
 created by this [one infinite Essence] but that they descended from it
 in such way that the statement “God exists” is never true without the,
 statement “The world-soul exists” also being true. And they affirmed
 that the world-soul is the unfolding of the Divine Mind, so that all
 things—which in God are one Exemplar—are, in the world-soul,
 many distinct [exemplars]. They added that God naturally precedes
 this connecting necessity, that the world-soul naturally precedes mo
tion, and that motion qua instrument [precedes] the temporal unfold
ing of things, so that those things which exist truly in the [world]-soul
 and exist in matter as possibilities are temporally unfolded through
 motion. This temporal unfolding follows the natural order which is in
 the world-soul and which is called “fate substantified.” And the tem
poral unfolding of substantified fate is a fate (as it is called by many)
 which descends actually and causally from that [substantified fate].94
De Docta Ignorantia II, 9
 83
 144
 145
 And so, the mode-of-being that is in the world-soul is [the mode]
 in accordance with which we say that the world is intelligible. The
 mode of actual being—which results from the actual determination of
 possibility by way of unfolding—is, as was said, the mode of being
 according to which the world is perceptible, in the opinion of the Pla
tonists. They did not claim that forms as they exist in matter are other
 than forms which exist in the world-soul but [claimed] only that forms
 exist according to different modes of being: in the world-soul [they
 exist] truly and in themselves; in matter [they exist] not in their puri
ty but in concealment—as likenesses. [The Platonists] added that the
 truth of forms is attained only through the intellect; through reason,
 imagination, and sense, nothing but images [are attained], according
 as the forms are mixed with possibility. And [they maintained] that
 therefore they did not attain to anything truly but [only] as a matter
 of opinion.
 The Platonists thought that all motion derives from this world
soul, which they said to be present as a whole in the whole world and
 as a whole in each part of the world. Nevertheless, it does not exer
cise the same powers in all parts [of the world]—just as in man the
 rational soul does not operate in the same way in the hair and in the
 heart, although it is present as a whole in the whole [man] and in each
 part. Hence, the Platonists claimed that in the world-soul all souls—
 whether in bodies or outside [of bodies]—are enfolded. For they as
serted that the world-soul is spread throughout the entire universe—
 [spread] not through parts (because it is simple and indivisible) but
 as a whole in the earth, where it holds the earth together, as a whole
 in stone, where it effects the steadfastness of the stone's parts, as a
 whole in water, as a whole in trees, and so on for each thing. The
 world-soul is the first circular unfolding (the Divine Mind being the
 center point, as it were, and the world-soul being the circle which un
folds the center) and is the natural enfolding of the whole temporal
 order of things. Therefore, because of the world-soul's distinctness and
 order, the Platonists called it “self-moving number” and asserted that
 it is from sameness and difference. They also thought that the world
soul differs from the human soul only in number, so that just as the
 human soul is to man so the world-soul is to the universe. [Moreover,]
 they believed that all souls are from the world-soul and that ultimate
ly they are resolved into it, provided their moral failures do not pre
vent this.
84
 De Docta Ignorantia II, 9
 146
 147
 Many Christians consented to this Platonistic approach. Especial
ly since the essence of stone is distinct from the essence of man and
 in God there is neither differentiation nor otherness, they thought it
 necessary that these distinct essences (in accordance with which,
 things are distinct) be subsequent to God but prior to things (for the
 essence precedes the thing); and [they thought] this [too] with regard
 to intelligence, the mistress of the orbits. Furthermore, [they believed]
 that such distinct essences as these are the indestructible notions-of
things in the world-soul. Indeed, they maintained—though they admit
 that it is difficult to say and think—that the world-soul consists of all
 the notions of all things, so that in it all notions are its substance.
 [These Christians] support their view by the authority of divine Scrip
ture: “God said 'Let there be light,' and light was made.” If the truth
 of light had not been naturally antecedent, what sense would it have
 made for Him to say “Let there be light”? And if the truth of light
 had not been antecedent, then after the light was temporally unfold
ed, why would it have been called light rather than something else?
 Such [Christians] adduce many similar considerations to support this
 view.
 The Peripatetics, although admitting that the work of nature is the
 work of intelligence, do not admit that there are exemplars. I think that
 they are surely wrong—unless by “intelligence” they mean God. For
 if there is no notion within the intelligence, how does the intelligence
 purposefully cause motion? [On the other hand,] if there is a notion
 of the thing-to-be-unfolded-temporally (this notion would be the
 essence of motion),95 then such [a notion] could not have been ab
stracted from a thing which does not yet exist temporally. Therefore,
 if there exists a notion which has not been abstracted, surely it is the
 notion about which the Platonists speak—[a notion] which is not [de
rived] from things but [is such that] things accord with it. Hence, the
 Platonists did not affirm that such essences of things are something
 distinct and different from the intelligence; rather, [they said] that such
 distinct [essences] jointly constitute a certain simple intelligence which
 enfolds in itself all essences. Hence, although the essence of man is
 not the essence of stone but the two are different essences, the hu
manity from which man derives (as white derives from whiteness) has
 no other being than—in intelligence—intelligibly and according to the
 nature of intelligence and—in reality—really.96 [This does] not [mean]
 that there is the humanity of Plato and another separate humanity.
 Rather, according to different modes of being the same humanity ex
De Docta Ignorantia II, 9
 85
 ists naturally in the intelligence before existing in matter—not tem
porally before but in the sense that the essence naturally precedes the
 thing.
 148
 149
 The Platonists spoke quite keenly and sensibly, being reproached,
 unreasonably, perhaps, by Aristotle, who endeavored to refute them
 with a covering of words rather than with deep discernment. But
 through learned ignorance I shall ascertain what the truer [view] is. I
 have [already] indicated97 that we do not attain to the unqualifiedly
 Maximum and that, likewise, absolute possibility or absolute form
 (I.e., [absolute] actuality) which is not God cannot exist. And [I indi
cated] that no being except God is uncontracted98 and that there is
 only one Form of forms and Truth of truths99 and that the maximum
 truth of the circle is not other than that of the quadrangle.100 Hence,
 the forms of things are not distinct except as they exist contractedly;
 as they exist absolutely they are one, indistinct [Form], which is the
 Word in God.101 lt follows that [a Platonistic-type] world-soul would
 exist only in conjunction with possibility, through which it would be
 contracted.102 Nor would it be the case that qua mind it is either sep
arated or separable from things; for if we consider mind according as
 it is separated from possibility, it is the Divine Mind, which alone is
 completely actual. Therefore, there cannot be many distinct exemplars,
 for each exemplar would be maximum and most true with respect to
 the things which are its exemplifications. But it is not possible that
 there be many maximal and most true things. For only one infinite Ex
emplar is sufficient and necessary; in it all things exist, as the ordered
 exists in the order. [This Exemplar] very congruently enfolds all the
 essences of things, regardless of how different they are, so that Infi
nite Essence is the most true Essence of the circle and is not greater
 or lesser or different or other [than the circle]. And Infinite Essence
 is the Essence of the quadrangle and is not greater or lesser or differ
ent [than the quadrangle]. The same holds true for other things, as we
 can discern from the example of an infinite line.103
 Seeing the differences of things, we marvel that the one most sim
ple Essence of all things is also the different essence of each thing.
 Yet, we know that this must be the case; [we know it] from learned
 ignorance, which shows that in God difference is identity. For in see
ing that the difference of the essences of all things exists most truly,
 we apprehend—since it is most true [that this difference exists most
 truly]—the one most true Essence-of-all-things, which is Maximum
86
 De Docta Ignorantia II, 9
 Truth. Therefore, when it is said that God created man by means of
 one essence and created stone by means of another, this is true with
 respect to things but not true with respect to the Creator—just as we
 see with regard to numbers. The number three is a most simple
 essence, which does not admit of more or less. In itself it is one
 essence; but as it is related to different things, it is, in accordance
 therewith, different essences. For example, in a triangle there is one
 essence of the number three for the three angles; in a substance there
 is another essence [of the number three] for the matter, the form, and
 their union; there is another essence [of the number three] for a fa
ther, a mother, and their offspring—or for three human beings or three
 asses. Hence, the connecting necessity is not, as the Platonists main
tained, a mind which is inferior to the Begetting Mind; rather, it is
 the divine Word and Son, equal with the Father. And it is called
 “Logos” or “Essence,” since it is the Essence of all things. Therefore,
 that which the Platonists said about the images of forms is of no ac
count; for there is only one infinite Form of forms, of which all forms
 are images, as I stated earlier104 at a certain point.
 150
 Therefore, it is necessary to understand clearly the following mat
ters: since [a Platonistic-type] world-soul must be regarded as a cer
tain universal form which enfolds in itself all forms105 but which has
 actual existence only contractedly in things and which in each thing
 is the contracted form of this thing, as was said earlier106 regarding
 the universe: then [not such a world-soul but] God—who in one Word
 creates all things, regardless of how different from one another they
 are—is the efficient, the formal, and the final Cause of all things; and
 there can be no created thing which is not diminished from contrac
tion and does not fall infinitely short of the divine work.107 God alone
 is absolute; all other things are contracted.108 Nor is there a medium
 between the Absolute and the contracted as those imagined who
 thought that the world-soul is mind existing subsequently to God but
 prior to the world's contraction. For only God is “world-soul” and
 “world-mind”—in a manner whereby “soul” is regarded as something
 absolute in which all the forms of things exist actually. Indeed, the
 philosophers were not adequately instructed regarding the Divine
 Word and Absolute Maximum. And so, they envisioned mind and soul
 and necessity as present uncontractedly in a certain unfolding of Ab
solute Necessity.
 Therefore, forms do not have actual existence except (1) in the
 Word as Word and (2) contractedly in things.109 But although the
De Docta Ignorantia II, 9 - 10
 87
 forms which are in the created intellectual nature exist with a greater
 degree of independence, in accordance with the intellectual nature,
 nevertheless they are not uncontracted; and so, they are the intellect,
 whose operation is to understand by means of an abstract likeness, as
 Aristotle says.110 In the book Conjectures [I will include] certain
 points regarding this [topic].111 Let the foregoing points about the
 world-soul suffice.
 151
 152
 Chapter Ten: The spirit of all things.
 Certain [thinkers] believed that motion, through which there is the
 union of form and matter, is a spirit—a medium, as it were, between
 form and matter. They considered it as pervading the firmament, the
 planets, and things terrestrial. The first [motion] they called “Atropos”---”without turning,” so to speak; for they believed that by a simple mo
tion the firmament is moved from east to west. The second [motion]
 they called “Clotho,” i.e., turning; for the planets are moved counter
 to the firmament through a turning from west to east. The third [mo
tion they called] “Lachesis,” i.e., fate, because chance governs terres
trial things.
 The motion of the planets is as an unrolling of the first motion;
 and the motion of temporal and terrestrial things is the unrolling of the
 motion of the planets. Certain causes of coming events are latent in
 terrestrial things, as the produce [is latent] in the seed. Hence, [these
 thinkers] said that the things enfolded in the world-soul as in a ball are
 unfolded and extended through such motion. For the wise thought as
 if [along the following line]:a craftsman [who] wants to chisel a stat
ue in stone and [who] has in himself the form of the statue, as an idea,
 produces—through certain instruments which he moves—the form of
 the statue in imitation of the idea; analogously, they thought, the
 world-mind or world-soul harbors in itself exemplars-of-things, which,
 through motion it unfolds in matter. And they said that this motion per
vades all things, just as does the world-soul. They said that this mo
tion—which, as fate,. descends (in the firmament, the planets, and ter
restrial things) actually and causally from substantified fate—is the un
folding of substantified fate. For through such motion, or spirit, a thing
 is actually determined toward being such [as it is]. They said that this
 uniting spirit proceeds from both possibility and the world soul. For
 matter has—from its aptitude for receiving form—a certain appetite,
 just as what is base desires what is good and privation desires pos
De Docta Ignorantia II, 10
 88
 session; furthermore, form desires to exist actually but cannot exist ab
solutely, since it is not its own being and is not God.112 Therefore,
 form descends, so that it exists contractedly in possibility; that is,
 while possibility ascends toward actual existence, form descends, so
 that it limits, and perfects, and terminates possibility. And so, from
 the ascent and the descent motion arises and conjoins the two. This
 motion is the medium-of-union of possibility and actuality, since from
 movable possibility and a formal mover, moving arises as a medium.
 153
 154
 Therefore, this spirit, which is called nature, is spread throughout.,
 and contracted by, the entire universe and each of its parts. Hence,
 nature is the enfolding (so to speak) of all things which occur through
 motion. But the following example shows how this motion is con
tracted from the universal into the particular and how order is pre
served throughout its gradations. When I say “God exists,” this sen
tence proceeds by means of a certain motion but in such an order that
 I first articulate the letters, then the syllables, then the words, and then,
 last of all, the sentence—although the sense of hearing does not dis
cern this order by stages. In like manner, motion descends by stages
 from the universal [universum] unto the particular, where it is con
tracted by the temporal or natural order. But this motion, or spirit, de
scends from the Divine Spirit, which moves all things by this motion.
 Hence, just as in an act of speaking there is a certain spirit (or breath]
 which proceeds from him who speaks—[a spirit] which is contracted
 into a sentence, as I mentioned—so God, who is Spirit, is the one from
 whom all motion descends. For Truth says: “It is not you who speak
 but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.”113 A similar thing
 holds true for all other motions and operations.
 Therefore, this created spirit114 is a spirit in whose absence it
 would not be the case that anything is one or is able to exist. Now,
 through this spirit, which fills the whole world,115 the entire world and
 all things in it are naturally and conjointly that which they are, so that
 by means of this spirit possibility is present in actuality and actuality
 is present in possibility. And this [spirit] is the motion of the loving
 union of all things and oneness, so that there is one universe of all
 things. For although all things are moved individually so as to be, in
 the best manner, that which they are and so that none will exist ex
actly as another,116 nevertheless each thing in its own way either me
diately or immediately contracts, and participates in, the motion of
 each other thing (just as the elements and the things composed of el
89
 De Docta Ignorantia II, 10 - 11
 emental principles [contract and participate in] the motion of the sky
 and just as all members [of the body contract and participate in] the
 motion of the heart), so that there is one
 universe.117 And through this motion things exist in the best way
 they can. They are moved for the following reason: viz., so that they
 may be preserved in themselves or in species—[preserved] by means
 of the natural union of the different sexes; these sexes are united in
 nature, which enfolds motion; but in individuals they are contracted
 separately.
 155
 156
 Therefore, it is not the case that any motion is unqualifiedly max
imum motion, for this latter coincides with rest. Therefore, no motion
 is absolute, since absolute motion is rest and is God. And absolute mo
tion enfolds all motions. Therefore, just as all possibility exists in Ab
solute Possibility, which is the Eternal God, and all form and actual
ity exist in Absolute Form, which is the Father's divine Word and Son,
 so all uniting motion and all uniting proportion and harmony exist in
 the Divine Spirit's Absolute Union, so that God is the one Beginning
 of all things. In Him and through Him all things exist118 in a certain
 oneness of trinity. They are contracted in a like manner in greater and
 lesser degree (within [the range between] the unqualifiedly Maximum
 and the unqualifiedly Minimum) according to their own gradations,
 so that in intelligent things, where to understand is to move, the gra
dation of possibility, actuality, and their uniting motion is one grada
tion, and in corporeal things, where to exist is to move, [the gradation]
 of matter, form, and their union is another gradation. I will touch upon
 these points elsewhere.119 Let the preceding [remarks] about the trin
ity of the universe suffice for the present.
 Chapter Eleven: Corollaries regarding motion.
 Perhaps those who will read the following previously unheard of [doc
trines] will be amazed, since learned ignorance shows these [doctrines]
 to be true. We already know from the aforesaid (a) that the universe
 is trine, (b) that of all things there is none which is not one from pos
sibility, actuality, and uniting motion,121 and (c) that none of these
 [three] can at all exist without the other [two], so that of necessity
 these [three] are present in all things according to very different de
grees.122 [They are present] so differently that no two things in the
 universe can be altogether equal with respect to them, i.e., with respect
 to any one of them. However, it is not the case that in any genus—
De Docta Ignorantia II, 11
 90
 even [the genus] of motion—we come to an unqualifiedly maximum
 and minimum.123 Hence, if we consider the various movements of the
 spheres, [we will see that] it is not possible for the world-machine to
 have, as a fixed and immovable center, either our perceptible earth or
 air or fire or any other thing. For, with regard to motion, we do not
 come to an unqualifiedly minimum—i.e., to a fixed center. For the [un
qualifiedly] minimum must coincide with the [unqualifiedly] maxi
mum; therefore, the center of the world coincides with the circumfer
ence.124 Hence, the world does not have a [fixed] circumference. For
 if it had a [fixed] center, it would also have a [fixed] circumference;
 and hence it would have its own beginning and end within itself, and
 it would be bounded in relation to something else, and beyond the
 world there would be both something else and space (locus). But all
 these [consequences] are false. Therefore, since it is not possible for
 the world to be enclosed between a physical center and [a physical]
 circumference, the world—of which God is the center and the cir
cumference—is not understood. And although the world is not infinite,
 it cannot be conceived as finite, because it lacks boundaries within
 which it is enclosed.
 157
 Therefore, the earth, which cannot be the center, cannot be de
void of all motion. Indeed, it is even necessary that the earth be moved
 in such way that it could be moved infinitely less. Therefore, just as
 the earth is not the center of the world, so the sphere of fixed stars is
 not its circumference—although when we compare the earth with the
 sky, the former seems to be nearer to the center, and the latter nearer
 to the circumference. Therefore, the earth is not the center either of the
 eighth sphere or of any other sphere. Moreover, the appearance of the
 six constellations above the horizon does not establish that the earth
 is at the center of the eighth sphere. For even if the earth were at a
 distance from the center but were on the axis passing through the
 [sphere's] poles, so that one side [of the earth] were raised toward the
 one pole and the other side were lowered toward the other pole, then
 it is evident that only half the sphere would be visible to men, who
 would be as distant from the poles as the horizon is extended. More
over, it is no less false that the center of the world is within the earth
 than that it is outside the earth; nor does the earth or any other sphere
 even have a center. For since the center is a point equidistant from
 the circumference and since there cannot exist a sphere or a circle so
 completely true that a truer one could not be posited, it is obvious that
 there cannot be posited a center [which is so true and precise] that a
De Docta Ignorantia II, 11
 91
 still truer and more precise center could not be posited. Precise
 equidistance to different things cannot be found except in the case of
 God, because God alone is Infinite Equality. Therefore, He who is the
 center of the world, viz., the Blessed God, is also the center of the
 earth, of all spheres, and of all things in the world. Likewise, He is
 the infinite circumference of all things.125
 158
 159
 Moreover, in the sky there are not fixed and immovable poles—
 although the heaven of fixed stars appears to describe by its motion
 circles of progressively different sizes, colures which are smaller than
 the equinoctial [colure]. The case is similar for the intermediates. But
 it is necessary that every part of the sky be moved, even though [the
 parts are moved] unequally by comparison with the circles described
 by the motion of the stars. Hence, just as certain stars appear to de
scribe a maximum circle, so certain stars [appear to describe] a min
imum [circle]. And there is not a star which fails to describe an [ap
proximate circle]. Therefore, since there is not a fixed pole in the
 [eighth] sphere, it is evident that we also do not find an exact middle
 point existing equidistantly, as it were, from the poles. Therefore, in
 the eighth sphere there is not a star which describes, through its rev
olution, a maximum circle. (For the star would have to be equidistant
 from the poles, which do not exist.) And consequently there is not [a
 star] which describes a minimum circle. Therefore, the poles of the
 spheres coincide with the center,126 so that the center is not anything
 except the pole, because the Blessed God [is the center and the pole].
 And since we can discern motion only in relation to something fixed,
 viz., either poles or centers, and since we presuppose these [poles or
 centers] when we measure motions, we find that as we go about con
jecturing, we err with regard to all [measurements]. And we are sur
prised when we do not find that the stars are in the right position ac
cording to the rules of measurement of the ancients, for we suppose
 that the ancients rightly conceived of centers and poles and measures.
 From these [foregoing considerations] it is evident that the earth
 is moved. Now, from the motion of a comet, we learn that the elements
 of air and of fire are moved; furthermore, [we observe] that the moon
 [is moved] less from east to west than Mercury or Venus or the sun,
 and so on progressively. Therefore, the earth is moved even less than
 all [these] others; but, nevertheless, being a star, it does not describe
 a minimum circle around a center or a pole. Nor does the eighth sphere
 describe a maximum [circle], as was just proved.
92
 De Docta Ignorantia II, 11 - 12
 160
 161
 162
 Therefore, consider carefully the fact that just as in the eighth
 sphere the stars are [moved] around conjectural poles, so the earth,
 the moon, and the planets—as stars—are moved at a distance and with
 a difference around a pole [which] we conjecture to be where the cen
ter is believed to be. Hence, although the earth—as star—is nearer to
 the central pole, nevertheless it is moved and, in its motion, does not
 describe a minimum circle, as was indicated. Rather (though the mat
ter appears to us to be otherwise), neither the sun nor the moon nor
 the earth nor any sphere can by its motion describe a true circle, since
 none of these are moved about a fixed [point]. Moreover, it is not the
 case that there can be posited a circle so true that a still truer one can
not be posited. And it is never the case that at two different times [a
 star or a sphere] is moved in precisely equal ways or that [on these
 two occasions its motion] describes equal approximate-circles—even
 if the matter does not seem this way to us.
 Therefore, if with regard to what has now been said you want
 truly to understand something about the motion of the universe, you
 must merge the center and the poles, aiding yourself as best you can
 by your imagination. For example, if someone were on the earth but
 beneath the north pole [of the heavens] and someone else were at the
 north pole [of the heavens], then just as to the one on the earth it
 would appear that the pole is at the zenith, so to the one at the pole
 it would appear that the center is at the zenith.127 And just as an
tipodes have the sky above, as do we, so to those [persons] who are
 at either pole [of the heavens] the earth would appear to be at the
 zenith. And at whichever [of these] anyone would be, he would be
lieve himself to be at the center. Therefore, merge these different
 imaginative pictures so that the center is the zenith and vice versa.128
 Thereupon you.will see—through the intellect, to which only learned
 ignorance is of help—that the world and its motion and shape cannot
 be apprehended.129 For [the world] will appear as a wheel in a wheel
 and a sphere in a sphere—having its center and circumference
 nowhere, as was stated.
 Chapter Twelve: The conditions of the earth.
 The ancients did not attain unto the points already made, for they
 lacked learned ignorance. It has already130 become evident to us that
 the earth is indeed moved, even though we do not perceive this to be
 the case. For we apprehend motion only through a certain compari
De Docta Ignorantia II, 12
 93
 son with something fixed. For example, if someone did not know that
 a body of water was flowing and did not see the shore while he was
 on a ship in the middle of the water, how would he recognize that the
 ship was being moved? And because of the fact that it would always
 seem to each person (whether he were on the earth, the sun, or an
other star) that he was at the “immovable” center, so to speak, and that
 all other things were moved: assuredly, it would always be the case
 that if he were on the sun, he would fix a set of poles in relation to
 himself; if on the earth, another set; on the moon, another; on Mars,
 another; and so on. Hence, the world-machine will have its center
 everywhere and its circumference nowhere, so to speak; for God, who
 is everywhere and nowhere, is its circumference and center.131
 163
 164
 Moreover, the earth is not spherical, as some have said; yet, it
 tends toward sphericity, for the shape of the world is contracted in the
 world's parts, just as is [the world's] motion. Now, when an infinite
 line is considered as contracted in such way that, as contracted, it can
not be more perfect and more capable, it is [seen to be] circular; for
 in a circle the beginning coincides with the end. Therefore, the most
 nearly perfect motion is circular; and the most nearly perfect corpo
real shape is therefore spherical. Hence, for the sake of the perfec
tion, the entire motion of the part is oriented toward the whole. For
 example, heavy things [are moved] toward the earth and light things
 upwards; earth [is moved] toward earth, water toward water, air to
ward air, fire toward fire. And the motion of the whole tends toward
 circular motion as best it can, and all shape [tends toward] spherical
 shape—as we experience with regard to the parts of animals, to trees,
 and to the sky. Hence, one motion is more circular and more perfect
 than another. Similarly, shapes, too, are different.
 Therefore, the shape of the earth is noble and spherical, and the
 motion of the earth is circular; but there could be a more perfect
 [shape or motion]. And because in the world there is no maximum
 or minimum with regard to perfections, motions, and shapes (as is
 evident from what was just said), it is not true that the earth is the
 lowliest and the lowest. For although [the earth] seems more central
 with respect to the world, it is also for this same reason nearer to
 the pole, as was said.132 Moreover, the earth is not a proportional
 part, or an aliquot part, of the world. For since the world does not
 have either a maximum or a minimum, it also does not have a mid
dle point or aliquot parts, just as a man or an animal does not ei
De Docta Ignorantia II, 12
 94
 165
 166
 ther. For example, a hand is not an aliquot part of a man, although
 its weight does seem to bear a comparative relation to the body—
 and likewise regarding its size and shape.133 Moreover, [the earth's]
 blackness is not evidence of its lowliness. For if someone were on
 the sun, the brightness which is visible to us would not be visible
 [to him]. For when the body of the sun is considered, [it is seen to]
 have a certain more central “earth,” as it were, and a certain “fiery
 and circumferential” brightness, as it were, and in its middle a “wa
tery cloud and brighter air,” so to speak-just as our earth [has] its
 own elements. Hence, if someone were outside the region of fire, then
 through the medium of the fire our earth, which is on the circumfer
ence of [this] region, would appear to be a bright star—just as to us,
 who are on the circumference of the region of the sun, the sun ap
pears to be very bright. Now, the moon does not appear to be so bright,
 perhaps because we are within its circumference and are facing the
 more central parts—i.e., are in the moon's “watery region,” so to
 speak. Hence, its light is not visible [to us], although the moon does
 have its own light, which is visible to those who are at the most out
ward points of its circumference; but only the light of the reflection
 of the sun is visible to us. On this account, too, the moon's heat—
 which it no doubt produces as a result of its motion and in greater de
gree on the circumference, where the motion is greater—is not com
municated to us, unlike what happens with regard to the sun. Hence,
 our earth seems to be situated between the region of the sun and the
 region of the moon; and through the medium of the sun and the moon
 it partakes of the influence of other stars which—because of the fact
 that we are outside their regions—we do not see. For we see only the
 regions of those stars which gleam.
 Therefore, the earth is a noble star which has a light and a heat
 and an influence that are distinct and different from [that of] all other
 stars, just as each star differs from each other star with respect to its
 light, its nature, and its influence. And each star communicates its light
 and influence to the others, though it does not aim to do so, since all
 stars gleam and are moved only in order to exist in the best way [they
 can]; as a consequence thereof a sharing arises (just as light shines of
 its own nature and not in order that I may see; yet, as a consequence,
 a sharing occurs when I use light for the purpose of seeing). Similar
ly, Blessed God created all things in such way that when each thing
 desires to conserve its own existence as a divine work, it conserves it
 in communion with others. Accordingly, just as by virtue of the fact
De Docta Ignorantia II, 12
 95
 that the foot exists merely for walking, it serves not only itself but also
 the eye, the hands, the body, and the entire human being (and simi
larly for the eye and the other members), so a similar thing holds true
 regarding the parts of the world. For Plato referred to the world as an
 animal.134 If you take God to be its soul, without intermingling, then
 many of the points I have been making will be clear to you.
 167
 168
 169
 Moreover, we ought not to say that because the earth is smaller
 than the sun and is influenced by the sun, it is more lowly [than the
 sun]. For the entire region-of-the-earth, which extends to the circum
ference of fire, is large. And although the earth is smaller than the
 sun—as we know from the earth's shadow and from eclipses—we do
 not know to what extent the region of the sun is larger or smaller than
 the region of the earth. However, the sun's region cannot be precise
ly equal to the earth's, for no star can be equal to another star. More
over, the earth is not the smallest star, because the earth is larger than
 the moon, as our experience of eclipses has taught us. And [the earth
 is larger] than Mercury, too, as certain [people] maintain; and perhaps
 [it is also larger] than other stars. Hence, the evidence from size does
 not establish [the earth's] lowliness.
 Furthermore, the influence which [the earth] receives is not evi
dence establishing its imperfection. For being a star, perhaps the earth,
 too, influences the sun and the solar region, as I said.135 And since
 we do not experience ourselves in any other way than as being in the
 center where influences converge, we experience nothing of this
 counter-influence. For suppose the earth is possibility; and suppose the
 sun is the soul, or formal actuality, with respect to the possibility; and
 suppose the moon is the middle link, so that these [three] stars, which
 are situated within one region, unite their mutual influences (the other
 stars—viz., Mercury, Venus, and the others—being above, as the an
cients and even some moderns said). Then, it is evident that the mu
tual relationship of influence is such that one influence cannot exist
 without the other. Therefore, in each alike [viz., earth, sun, moon] the
 influence will be both one and three in accordance with its [i.e., the
 influence's] own degrees. Therefore, it is evident that human beings
 cannot know whether with respect to these things [viz., the influences]
 the region of the earth exists in a less perfect and less noble degree
 in relation to the regions of the other stars (viz., the sun, the moon,
 and the others). Nor [can we know this] with respect to space, either.
 For example, [we cannot rightly claim to know] that our portion of the
De Docta Ignorantia II, 12
 96
 world is the habitation of men and animals and vegetables which are
 proportionally less noble [than] the inhabitants in the region of the sun
 and of the other stars. For although God is the center and circumfer
ence of all stellar regions and although natures of different nobility
 proceed from Him and inhabit each region (lest so many places in the
 heavens and on the stars be empty and lest only the earth—presum
ably among the lesser things—be inhabited), nevertheless with regard
 to the intellectual natures a nobler and more perfect nature cannot, it
 seems, be given (even if there are inhabitants of another kind on other
 stars) than the intellectual nature which dwells both here on earth and
 in its own region. For man does not desire a different nature but only
 to be perfected in his own nature.
 170
 171
 Therefore, the inhabitants of other stars—of whatever sort these
 inhabitants might be—bear no comparative relationship to the inhab
itants of the earth (istius mundi). [This is true] even if, with respect
 to the goal of the universe, that entire region bears to this entire re
gion a certain comparative relationship which is hidden to us—so that
 in this way the inhabitants of this earth or region bear, through the
 medium of the whole region, a certain mutual relationship to those
 other inhabitants. (By comparison, the particular parts of the fingers
 of a hand bear, through the medium of the hand, a comparative rela
tionship to a foot; and the particular parts of the foot [bear], through
 the medium of the foot, [a comparative relationship] to a hand—so
 that all [members] are comparatively related to the whole animal.)136
 Hence, since that entire region is unknown to us, those inhabi
tants remain altogether unknown. By comparison, here on earth it hap
pens that animals of one species—[animals] which constitute one spe
cific region, so to speak—are united together; and because of the com
mon specific region, they mutually share those things which belong
 to their region; they neither concern themselves about other [regions]
 nor apprehend truly anything regarding them.137 For example, an an
imal of one species cannot grasp the thought which [an animal] of an
other [species] expresses through vocal signs—except for a superficial
 grasping in the case of a very few signs, and even then [only] after
 long experience and only conjecturally. But we are able to know dis
proportionally less about the inhabitants of another region. We surmise
 that in the solar region there are inhabitants which are more solar, bril
liant, illustrious, and intellectual—being even more spiritlike than
 [those] on the moon, where [the inhabitants] are more moonlike, and
De Docta Ignorantia II, 12
 97
 172
 173
 than [those] on the earth, [where they are] more material and more
 solidified. Thus, [we surmise], these intellectual solar natures are
 mostly in a state of actuality and scarcely in a state of potentiality;
 but the terrestrial [natures] are mostly in potentiality and scarcely in
 actuality; lunar [natures] fluctuate between [solar and terrestrial na
tures]. We believe this on the basis of the fiery influence of the sun
 and on the basis of the watery and aerial influence of the moon and
 the weighty material influence of the earth. In like manner, we surmise
 that none of the other regions of the stars are empty of inhabitants—
 as if there were as many particular mondial parts of the one universe
 as there are stars, of which there is no number.138 Resultantly, the one
 universal world is contracted—in a threefold way and in terms of its
 own fourfold descending progression—in so many particular [parts]
 that they are without number except to Him who created all things in
 a [definite] number.139
 Moreover, the earthly destruction-of-things which we experience
 is not strong evidence of [the earth's] lowliness. For since there is one
 universal world and since there are causal relations between all the
 individual stars, it cannot be evident to us that anything is altogether
 corruptible;140 rather, [a thing is corruptible only] according to one
 or another mode of being, for the causal influences—being contract
ed, as it were, in one individual—are separated, so that the mode of
 being such and such perishes. Thus, death does not occupy any space,
 as Virgil says.141 For death seems to be nothing except a composite
 thing's being resolved into its components. And who can know
 whether such dissolution occurs only in regard to terrestrial inhabi
tants?
 Certain [people] have said that on earth there are as many species
 of things as there are stars. Therefore, if in this way the earth con
tracts to distinct species the influence of all the stars, why is there not
 a similar occurrence in the regions of other stars which receive stel
lar influences? And who can know whether all the influences which
 at first are contracted at the time of composition revert at the time of
 dissolution, so that an animal which is now a contracted individual of
 a certain species in the region of the earth is freed from all influence
 of the stars, so that it returns to its origins? Or [who can know]
 whether only the form reverts to the exemplar or world-soul, as the
 Platonists say, or whether only the form reverts to its own star (from
 which the species received actual existence on mother earth) and the
 matter [reverts] to possibility, while the uniting spirit remains in the
De Docta Ignorantia II, 12 - 13
 98
 174
 175
 motion of the stars?—[whether. i.e.,] when this spirit ceases to unite
 and when it withdraws because of the indisposition of the [animal's]
 organs or for some other reason, so that by its difference of motion it
 induces a separation, then it returns as if to the stars, and its form as
cends above the influence of the stars, whereas its matter descends
 beneath [their influence]. Or [who can know] whether the forms of
 each region come to rest in a higher form—e.g., an intellectual form—
 and through this higher form attain the end which is the goal of the
 world? And how is this end in God attained by the lower forms
 through this higher form? And how does the higher form ascend to
 the circumference, which is God, while the body descends toward the
 center, where God is also present, so that the motion of all [the com
ponents] is toward God? For just as the center and the circumference
 are one in God. so some day the body (although it seemed to descend
 as if to the center) and the soul ([although it seemed to ascend as if]
 to the circumference) will be united again in God, at the time when
 not all motion will cease but [only] that which relates to generation.
 So to speak: the essential parts of the world (without which the world
 could not exist) will, necessarily, come together again when there ceas
es to be successive generation and when the uniting spirit returns and
 unites possibility to its [i.e., spirit's] own form.
 Of himself a man cannot know these matters; [he can know them]
 only if he has [this knowledge] from God in a quite special way. Al
though no one doubts that the Perfect God created all things for Him
self and that He does not will the destruction of any of the things He
 created, and although everyone knows that God is a very generous re
warder of all who worship Him, nevertheless only God Himself, who
 is His own Activity, knows the manner of Divine Activity's present and
 future remuneration. Nevertheless, I will say a few things about this
 later,142 according to the divinely inspired truth. At the moment, it suf
fices that I have, in ignorance, touched upon these matters in the fore
going way.
 Chapter Thirteen: The admirable divine art in the creation 
of the world and of the elements.
 Since it is the unanimous opinion of the wise that visible things—in
 particular, the size, beauty, and order of things—lead us to an admi
ration for the divine art and the divine excellence, and since I have
 dealt with some of the products of God's admirable knowledge, let
99
 De Docta Ignorantia II, 13
 me (with regard to the creation of the universe and by way of admi
ration) very briefly add a few points about the place and the order of
 the elements.
 In creating the world, God used arithmetic, geometry, music, and
 likewise astronomy.143 (We ourselves also use these arts when we in
vestigate the comparative relationships of objects, of elements, and of
 motions.) For through arithmetic God united things. Through geome
try He shaped them, in order that they would thereby attain firmness,
 stability, and mobility in accordance with their conditions. Through
 music He proportioned things in such way that there is not more earth
 in earth than water in water, air in air, and fire in fire, so that no one
 element is altogether reducible to another. As a result, it happens that
 the world-machine cannot perish. Although part of one [element] can
 be reduced to another, it is not the case that all the air which is mixed
 with water can ever be transformed into water; for the surrounding
 air would prevent this; thus, there is ever a mingling of the elements.
 Hence, God brought it about that parts of the elements would be re
solved into one another. And since this occurs with a delay, a thing is
 generated from the harmony of elements in relation to the generable
 thing itself; and this thing exists as long as the harmony of elements
 continues; when the harmony is destroyed, what was generated is de
stroyed and dissolved.
 176
 And so, God, who created all things in number, weight, and mea
sure,144 arranged the elements in an admirable order. (Number pertains
 to arithmetic, weight to music, measure to geometry.) For example,
 heaviness is dependent upon lightness, which restricts it (for exam
ple, earth, which is heavy, is dependent upon fire in its “center,” so
 to speak); and lightness depends upon heaviness (e.g., fire depends
 upon earth). And when Eternal Wisdom ordained the elements, He
 used an inexpressible proportion, so that He foreknew to what extent
 each element should precede the other and so that He weighted the
 elements in such way that proportionally to water's being lighter than
 earth, air is lighter than water, and fire lighter than air—with the re
sult that weight corresponds to size and, likewise, a container occu
pies more space than what is contained [by it]. Moreover, He com
bined the elements with one another in such a relationship that, nec
essarily, the one element is present in the other. With regard to this
 combination, the earth is an animal. so to speak. according to Plato.145
 It has stones in place of bones, rivers in place of veins, trees in place
 of hair; and there are animals which are fostered within its hair, just
De Docta Ignorantia II, 13
 100
 as worms are fostered in the hair of animals.
 177
 178
 179
 And, so to speak: earth is to fire as the world is to God. For fire,
 in its relation to earth, has many resemblances to God. [For example]
 there is no limit to fire's power; and fire acts upon, penetrates, illu
mines, distinguishes, and forms all earthly things through the medi
um of air and of water, so that, as it were, in all the things which are
 begotten from earth there is nothing except fire's distinct activities.
 Hence, the forms of things are different as a result of a difference in
 fire's brightness. But fire is intermingled with things; it does not exist
 without them; and terrestrial things do not exist [without it]. God,
 however, is only absolute.146 Hence, God, who is light and in whom
 there is no darkness,147 is spoken of by the ancients as absolute con
suming fire148 and as absolute brightness. All existing things en
deavor, as best they can, to participate in His “brightness and blazing
 splendor,” so to speak—as we notice with regard to all the stars, in
 which participated brightness is found materially contracted. Indeed,
 this distinguishing and penetrating participated brightness is contract
ed “immaterially,” so to speak, in the life of things which are alive
 with an intellective life.
 Who would not admire this Artisan, who with regard to the
 spheres, the stars, and the regions of the stars used such skill that there
 is—though without complete precision—both a harmony of all things
 and a diversity of all things? [This Artisan] considered in advance the
 sizes, the placing, and the motion of the stars in the one world; and
 He ordained the distances of the stars in such way that unless each
 region were as it is, it could neither exist nor exist in such a place and
 with such an order—nor could the universe exist. Moreover, He be
stowed on all stars a differing brightness, influence, shape, color, and
 heat. (Heat causally accompanies the brightness.) And He established
 the interrelationship of parts so proportionally that in each thing the
 motion of the parts is oriented toward the whole. With heavy things
 [the motion is] downward toward the center, and with light things it
 is upward from the center and around the center (e.g., we perceive
 the motion of the stars as circular).
 With regard to these objects, which are so worthy of admiration,
 so varied, and so different, we recognize—through learned ignorance
 and in accordance with the preceding points—that we cannot know the
 rationale for any of God's works but can only marvel; for the Lord is
 great, whose greatness is without end.149 Since He is Absolute Max
De Docta Ignorantia II, 13
 101
 imality: as He is the Author and Knower of all His works, so He is
 also the End [of them all]; thus, all things are in Him and nothing is
 outside Him. He is the Beginning, the Middle, and the End of all
 things, the Center and the Circumference of all things—so that He
 alone is sought in all things; for without Him all things are nothing.
 When He alone is possessed, all things are possessed, because He is
 all things. When He is known, all things are known, because He is
 the Truth of all things. He even wills for us to be brought to the point
 of admiring so marvelous a world-machine. Nevertheless, the more we
 admire it, the more He conceals it from us; for it is Himself alone
 whom150 He wills to be sought with our whole heart and affection.
 And since He dwells in inaccessible light,151 which all things seek, He
 alone can open to those who knock and can give to those who ask.152
 Of all created things none has the power to open itself to him who
 knocks and to show what it is; for without God, who is present in all
 things, each thing is nothing.
 180
 But all things reply to him who in learned ignorance asks them
 what they are or in what manner they exist or for what purpose they
 exist: “Of ourselves [we are] nothing, and of our own ability we can
not tell you anything other than nothing. For we do not even know
 ourselves; rather, God alone—through whose understanding we are
 that which He wills, commands, and knows to be in us—[has knowl
edge of us]. Indeed, all of us are mute things. He is the one who speaks
 in [us] all., He has made us; He alone knows what we are, in what
 manner we exist, and for what purpose. If you wish to know some
thing about us, seek it in our Cause and Reason, not in us. There you
 will find all things, while seeking one thing. And only in Him will you
 be able to discover yourself.”
 See to it, says our learned ignorance, that you discover yourself
 in Him. Since in Him all things are Him, it will not be possible that
 you lack anything. Yet, our approaching Him who is inaccessible is
 not our prerogative; rather, it is the prerogative of Him who gave us
 both a face which is turned toward Him and a consuming desire to
 seek [Him]. When we do [seek Him], He is most gracious and will
 not abandon us. Instead, having disclosed Himself to us, He will sat
isfy us eternally “when His glory shall appear.”153
 May He be blessed forever.

 republished by W. de Gruyter (Berlin, 1967, 2 vols.): Cribratio Alkoran, De
 Ludo Globi.
 E. Banning Press edition (1985) of De Visione Dei.
 The references given for some of these treatises indicate book and chapter,
 for others margin number and line, and for still others page and line. Read
ers should have no difficulty determining which is which when they consult
 the particular Latin text. E.g., “DI II, 6 (125:19-20)” indicates De Docta Ig
norantia, Book II, Chap. 6, margin number 125, lines 19-20. And “Ap. 8:14
16” indicates Apologia Doctae Ignorantiae, p. 8, lines 14-16.
 15. A number of references in the Notes have been adapted from Vol. I of the Hei
delberg Academy edition of Nicolai de Cusa Opera Omnia.
 16. To reduce publication costs, extensive references to the writings of Anicius
 Boethius, Meister Eckhart, and Thierry of Chartres have not been incorporated
 into the Notes. Readers are advised to consult the works of Joseph E. Hofmann,
 Hans G. Senger, Herbert Wackerzapp, and Pierre Duhern as listed in PNC.
 17. The margin numbers in the English translation of DI correspond to those found
 in the Latin-German editions, cited in n. 1 above.
 18. Any Latin words inserted into the English translation for purposes of clarification
 are placed in parentheses—except that nouns whose respective cases have been
 changed to the nominative are bracketed. All expansions of the translations are
 bracketed.
 19. References to the Psalms are to the Douay version (and, in parentheses, to the King
 James's version).
 20. References to IL are given in terms of the new critical edition published in Nicholas

 of Cusa’s Debate with John Wenck: A Translation and an Appraisal of De Igno

 NOTES TO LEARNED IGNORANCE, BOOK TWO
 21. I.e., Cardinal Julian Cesarini. See n. 1 of the notes to Book One.
 22. DI I, 17 (49:13-14); I, 16 (46:10-12).
 23. Regarding the phrase “in sua ratione” (“in its definition”) at 92:4-5, cf. DP
 63:10-12: “For mathematics does not deal with a circle as it is in a corruptible floor
 but as it is in its [i.e., the circle's] own rational ground, or definition.”
 24. Viz., the rule that except for God all positable things differ (91:12-13).
 25. De Coniecturis II, 6 (105:9-15); II, 16 (163:1-9).
 26. Ibid. I, 10 (44-45). Cf. ibid. I, 9 (37:6-16).
 27. Nicholas's references to mathematics are to be coordinated as follows: no as
cent to the unqualifiedly Maximum is possible, as is evident from the illustration of
 the ascending scale of numbers; no descent to the unqualifiedly Minimum is possi
ble, as is evident from the illustration of the dividing of a continuum. See DI I, 5
 (13:13-2 1) and I, 17 (47:5-7).
 In dividing a continuum, no transition is made to oneness, which Nicholas re
gards as infinite [cf. DI I, 3 (9:7-8) with I, 5 (13:29-3 1) and I, 5 (14:1-8, 13-14).
 Also note De Coniecturis I, 5 (18:1-2).] Oneness is not subsequent to dividing (or sub
tracting), because it must be presupposed in order for dividing and subtracting to be
 possible. Thus, oneness precedes all plurality; in its absence, “there would be no dis
tinction of things; nor would any order or any plurality or any degrees of compara
tively greater and lesser be found among numbers; indeed, there would not be num
ber,” states Nicholas in I, 5 (13:25-28).
 28. DI I, 6 (15:6- 10).
 29. DI 1, 5 (13:17-2 1).
 30. DI III, 2. Jesus is this alluded-to Maximum.
 31. Cf. DP 6:8-15.
 32. See the reference in n. 4 of the notes to Book One. Also note DI I, 1 (2:4
5); I, 5
 13: 10); 11, 1 (97:19-20); 11, 2 (104:5-9); 11, 10 (154:7-9); 111, 1 (185:8-9); 111,
 3 (201:13-15).
 33. DI I, 6 (15:12-18).
 34. DI I, 13 (35:9-28).
 35. Though Nicholas believes that the more one a thing is, the more like unto
 God it is, he believes at the same time that God's oneness transcends the power of
 human conception [DI I, 4 (11:7-9)]. These joint beliefs leave him with the problem
 of reconciling his language of resemblance with his assertion that there is no com
parative relation between the finite and the infinite [I, 3 (9:4-5)]. See PNC, pp. 19
28 and 38.
 36. In the corresponding line of the Latin text (99:13) I am reading “contingen
Notes to Book Two
 105
 ter” for “contingenti”.
 37. Nowhere in DI or in any of his writings does Nicholas identify God with
 creation or creation with God. Note his response (Ap. 22:9-23:14) to John Wenck's
 charge that he taught that all things coincide with God. In his response he cites the
 above passage.
 38. Pseudo-Hermes Trismegistus, “Book of the Twenty-four Philosophers,”
 Proposition 14 [Clemens Baeumker, ed., “Das pseudo-hermetische 'Buch der
 vierundzwanzig Meister' (Liber XXIV philosophorum). Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte
 des Neupythagoreismus und Neuplatonismus im Mittelalter,” in Beiträge zur
 Geschichte der Philosophie und Theologie des Mittelalters, 25 (1928), 194-214].
 39. See n. 24 of the notes to Book One.
 40. In this chapter Nicholas uses both “abesse” and “adesse” to indicate depen
dent being. I have translated “abesse” by “derived being” and “adesse” by “adventi
tious being.”
 41. The word “in” is here crucial. The universe as enfolded in God ontological
ly prior to its unfolded, temporal existence is God, says Nicholas. Insofar as it is un
folded and temporal, however, it is neither God nor from God (i.e., from God in the
 sense of God's having caused its temporality and plurality); rather, its temporality and
 plurality derive from contingency. (See 99:11-13 of the present chapter.) Of course,
 its being qua being does derive from God.
 42. Cf. I, 26:6-13, where Wenck cites Eckhart's reason for why God did not cre
ate the world earlier.
 43. DI I, 3 (9:4-5); I, 1 (3:2-3).
 44. Regarding the view that a woman is a man manqué, see Aristotle, De Gen
eratione Animalium II, 3 (737a 28f.) and St. Thomas, Summa Theologiae Ia 99, 2, ad
 1.
 45. De Coniecturis II, 14 (143:7-8).
 46. See the references in n. 12 above and in n. 4 of the notes to Book One.
 47. See n. 15 above.
 48. DI III, 1 (189:4-21); I, 1 (2:3-5).
 49. See n. 78 of the notes to Book One.
 50. DI I, 4 (12:24-25).
 51. DI I, 5 (14:9-12).
 52. In the corresponding line of the Latin text (107:4), I am reading “complica
ta” for “explicata”.
 53. DI I, 7 (18:14-15).
 54. DI I, 7 (21:2-5).
 55. De Coniecturis I, 2 (7:3-5).
 56. DI I, 5 (14:18-21).
 57. In the corresponding line of the Latin text (108:14) 1 am reading “explicare
 omnia, scilicet” in place of “explicare, omnia scilicet”. Nicholas's point here paral
lels his point at 107:12.
 58. In the preceding paragraph (108:9-10) it was said that “God, in eternity, un
derstood one thing in one way and another thing in another way.” If God's under
standing is His being, then there seems to be a sense in which He is these things,
 reasons Nicholas.
 59. Nicholas is clearer in DI III, 1 (184:5-7): “Genera exist only contractedly in
Notes to Book Two
 106
 species; and species exist only in individuals, which alone exist actually.” Cf. II, 6
 (124:13-125:20).
 60. DI II, 2 (102:12-15).
 61. DI I, 21 (66:4). See n. 112 of the notes to Book One.
 62. Nicholas says not only that all things are in God (see n. 21 above) but also
 that God is in all things. He here attempts to give a clarifying illustration of the lat
ter thesis. Note DI II, 4 (118:3-13); II, 3 (107:12).
 63. In the corresponding line of the Latin text (112:13) 1 am reading “absoluto
 absolute” in place of “absoluta absoluto”.
 64. In the corresponding line of the Latin text (113:6) 1 am reading “qua” in
 place of “quo”. At 113:8 Wilpert's punctuation needs to be revised.
 65. DI I, 16 (42:4-5), where Nicholas alludes to what has been shown in I, 13
15.
 66. As a rule, Nicholas uses “world” and “universe” interchangeably. At DI 11,
 12 (170:2), however, “iste mundus” means “the earth”.
 67. DI I, 11 (30:11-13).
 68. Nicholas calls the world infinite and eternal, but in a qualified sense of “in
finite” and of “eternal”. It is privatively infinite [DI II, 1 (97:5)]; and it is eternal in
 the sense discussed in II, 2 (101). Also see II, 8 (140:1-3) as well as n. 21 above. Cf.
 Anselm of Canterbury, Proslogion 13.
 69. Nicholas's use here of the phrase “improportionally short of” is another tes
timony to his clear rejection of pantheism. See n. 17 above.
 70. In NA Nicholas changes his mind and is willing to make such statements as
 “In the sky God is sky. “ See J. Hopkins, Nicholas of Cusa on God as Not-other: A
 Translation and an Appraisal of De Li Non Aliud (Minneapolis: Banning Press, 2nd
 edition, 1983), p. 168, n. 18.
 As for the sense in which God is sun without plurality and difference, see DP
 11.
 71. I.e., is not the absolutely First.
 72. Nicholas does not hesitate to use the word “emanatio” since his version of
 emanation does not conflict with the doctrine of creation ex nihilo. See PNC, p. 166,
 n. 83.
 73. Metaphysica, tractate IX, chap. 4 (Venice edition of 1498).

 and the implications thereof.

 82. See n. 24 of the notes to Book One.
 83. Nicholas is here drawing a parallel. Just as in God there is Oneness, Equal
ity, and Union [DI 1, 7 (21:10-14)], so in the universe there is a oneness, an equali
ty, and a union of things. See the passage (in Book Two) that corresponds to the plac

 One.
 87. DI III, 1 (189:15-21); II, 2 (104:15-20).
 88. In the corresponding line of the Latin text (122:3) I am reading “a qua” in
 place of “a quo”. Cf. 147:15.
 89. De Coniecturis I, 4. By the time Nicholas wrote this treatise his views had
 become modified. The four onenesses are now said to be God, intelligence, soul, and
 body. See n. 73 below.

 93. Nicholas does not discuss this topic in De Coniecturis, as he had planned
 to. Josef Koch claimed that during the intervening time Nicholas switched from a
 Seinsmetaphysik to an Einheitsmetaphysik. See Die Ars coniecturalis des Nikolaus von
 Kues (Cologne: Westdeutscher Verlag, 1956), e.g., pp. 16 and 23.

 95. DI II, 10 (154:7-13).
 96. DI I, 7 (18:14).
 97. DI II, 9 (140:3-8).
 98. In I, 7 (18: 10-11) Nicholas identifies otherness and mutability.
 99. In the corresponding passage in the Latin text I have not adopted Wilpert's
 editorial addition.
 100. DI II, 9. According to Nicholas (in II, 9) the Platonists regarded connecting
 necessity as the world-soul. Nicholas does not endorse this view either here or in the
 later passage. He believes that, in a special sense, God is World-soul.
 101. Nicholas previously mentioned a different way in which the oneness of the
 universe is three. See DI II, 5 (120:3-4) and n. 63 above.
 102. DI II, 9. See n. 80 above.
 103. In DI II, 8 (140:1-2) Nicholas identifies Absolute Possibility with God [N.B.
 II, 8 (136)]. Absolute Possibility is minimum being; b6t in God minimum and max
imum coincide.
 In the passage above, however, Nicholas is not identifying absolute possibility
 with God. See n. 84 below and n. 48 of my introduction in Nicholas of Cusa's De
bate with John Wenck.
 104. By “the last three modes of being” Nicholas means connecting necessity,
 actually being this or that, and possibility. He does not mean Absolute Possibility qua
 God-as is shown clearly by his subsequent example of the rose and his reiteration of
 the three modes as “the mode of being of possibility, the mode of being of necessi
ty, and the mode of being of actual determination.” Nicholas, in fact, here leaves open
 the question of whether absolute possibility is or is not God. In chapter 8, where he
 discusses the Platonists' view that Absolute Possibility is not God, he puts forth his
 own diametrically opposed view.
 105. It would because the simple (incomposite) precedes the composite [DI I, 7
 (21:4); DP 46:9].

 109. Nicholas's placing of “non . . . nisi'” in his Latin sentences does not always
 accurately reflect what he means. Here what he means is expressible with the help
 of hyphens: “God is only the cause-of-actuality” (i.e., He is not the cause-of-possi
bility). This thought is better expressed in English as “God is the cause only of ac
tuality” (i.e., not also of possibility).

 111. See notes 21 and 48 above.

 are not dealt with in the detail which Nicholas's words herald. Cf. n. 73 above.

 114. Regarding the translation of this sentence (143:16-17), cf. the Latin with the
 sentence in II, 10 (151:26-29).
 115. In the corresponding line of the Latin text (147:6) I am reading “motus, talis”
 instead of “notio talis”.
 116. A major problem for the reader of DI II, 9 is to determine when Nicholas is
 endorsing a statement and when he is not. His own viewpoint throughout this chap
ter is presented unclearly. In the above passage he is merely representing the Platon
ists' view.
 117. DI I, 6 (15:6-10); 11, 1 (96:1-4); 11, 8 (136:1-8).
 118. DI I, 6 (15:3-4); 11, 8 (136:9-10).
 119. This statement is inferable by piecing together various of Nicholas's asser
tions. E.g., DI I, 5 (14:6-8); I, 7 (21:1-3); I, 23 (70:23); I, 21 (66:7); I, 14 (37:12
13).
 120. DI I, 16 (42:4-5).
 121. Nicholas does not subscribe to the view that intermediate between God and
 the world there is a world-soul (whether contracted or uncontracted) which harbors
 the Forms of the objects in the world. (If there were such a soul, however, he be
lieves that it would have to be contracted.) Instead, he teaches that the Word of God
 is the one infinite Form of forms. He is prepared to call this Word “World-soul” for
 much the same reason he is prepared to call God “sun”. Cf. DI II, 9 (150:13-16) with
 DP 11. Also note DP 12:15-21 and Idiota de Mente 13 (145:7-9).
 122. Nicholas is not here endorsing the view that there is a world-soul contracted
 through possibility. (See notes 96 and 101 above.) He is drawing the conclusion that
 a Platonistic type world-soul would have to be contracted, could not exist apart from
 other things (and therefore would not be divine), and could not be the repository of
 a plurality of exemplars.

 to be repunctuated.

 109
 129. Since in the Word of God these forms are the Word of God, they do not
 retain their plurality but exist absolutely in the Absolute, teaches Nicholas. In the
 subsequent sentence Nicholas makes clear that contracted forms exist in one way in
 the finite objects whose forms they are and in another way in the abstracting intel
lect. [See II, 6 (125)]. Forms, therefore, have three different modes of being: ( 1) as
 they are in God, so to speak; (2) as they are in formed objects; (3) as they are in the
 abstracting intellect.

 144. Cf. DI I, 23 (70:7-8). Nicholas's reasoning seems to be the following: The
 center-of-the-world, an unqualifiedly minimum, cannot be a fixed, physical center, be
cause with regard to motions and other things that can be comparatively greater and
 lesser, we do not come to an unqualifiedly minimum, with which the unqualifiedly
 maximum coincides [DI I, 3 (9:4-7); II, 1 (96:1-9); II, 10 (155:1-3); II, 12 (164:2-4);
 III, 1 (183:3-10). See DP 10:19-211. Hence, only God, who is the unqualifiedly Max
imum and Minimum, can be the center of the world. In the next chapter Nicholas
 states that the world has “its center everywhere and its circumference nowhere, so to
 speak; for God, who is everywhere and nowhere, is its circumference and center.”
 145. DI II, 11 (159:1-2); II, 12 (162:15-17). See n. 131 below.
 146. The poles of the spheres are not fixed, physical poles because if they were
 there would also have to be a fixed, physical center—something whose existence
 Nicholas has argued to be impossible. Rather, since God is the center of the spheres
 and since there could not be a center without there also being poles, God is also the
 poles. He is pole in such way that pole is center; and He is center in such way that
 center is pole. See n. 124 above.
 147. I.e., it would appear to the one at the pole that the center is where he is.
 (He is, by hypothesis, at the zenith.) That is, it would appear to him that he is at the
 center.
 148. Nicholas is not saying that the north pole of the heavens and the point on
 the earth are identical. Indeed, the distances are real distances. Rather, he is observ
ing that no absolute physical center exists. God is the absolute center of the world in
 that—qua infinite, conscious Spirit—He is equally close to, and equally distant from,
 all things. For this reason Nicholas calls Him Infinite Equality and regards Him not
 only as the center and circumference of the world but also as the center and circum
Notes to Book Two
 110
 ference of each thing within the world.
 149. Rather than saying (1) that the world (i.e., the universe) has no motion and
 no shape or (2) that it makes no sense to ascribe to it motion and shape, Nicholas re
gards it as having a motion and a shape which are unknowable by finite minds.

 BOOK THREE

 Prologue
 Having set forth the few preceding points about how the universe ex
ists in contraction, I will very briefly expound for Your most admirable
 Diligence1 the concept of Jesus. [I will do so] to the end that—as re
gards Him who is both Absolute Maximum and contracted maximum,
 viz., the ever-blessed Jesus Christ—I may learnedly in ignorance in
vestigate several points, in order to increase our faith and perfection.
 I will call upon Christ, in order that He may be the way unto Him
self, who is the Truth.2 By this Truth we are made alive—at present
 by faith and in the future by actual attainment—in Him and through
 Him who is Everlasting Life.

 De Docta Ignorantia III, 1
 182
 183
 184
 Chapter One: A maximum which is contracted to this or
 that and than which there cannot be a
 greater cannot exist apart from the
 Absolute [Maximum].
 Book One shows that the one absolutely Maximum—which is in
communicable, unintermixable, incontractible to this or that—exists in
 itself as eternally, equally, and unchangeably the same. Book Two
 thereafter exhibits the contraction of the universe, for the universe ex
ists only as contractedly this and that. Thus, the Oneness of the Max
imum exists absolutely in itself; the oneness of the universe exists con
tractedly in plurality. Now, the many things in which the universe is
 actually contracted cannot at all agree in supreme equality; for then
 they would cease being many. Therefore, it is necessary that all things
 differ from one another—either (1) in genus, species, and number or
 (2) in species and number or (3) in number—so that each thing exists
 in its own number, weight, and measure.3 Hence, all things are dis
tinguished from one another by degrees, so that no thing coincides
 with another. Accordingly, no contracted thing can participate pre
cisely in the degree of contraction of another thing, so that, necessar
ily, any given thing is comparatively greater or lesser than any other
 given thing. Therefore, all contracted things exist between a maximum
 and a minimum, so that there can be posited a greater and a lesser de
gree of contraction than [that of] any given thing. Yet, this process
 does not continue actually unto infinity, because an infinity of degrees
 is impossible,4 since to say that infinite degrees actually exist is noth
ing other than to say that no degree exists—as I stated about number
 in Book One.5 Therefore, with regard to contracted things, there can
not be an ascent or a descent to an absolutely maximum or an ab
solutely minimum. Hence, just as the Divine Nature, which is ab
solutely maximal, cannot be diminished so that it becomes finite and
 contracted, so neither can the contracted nature become diminished in
 contraction to the point that it becomes altogether absolute [i.e., alto
gether free of contraction. ]6
 Therefore, it is not the case that any contracted thing attains to
 the limit either of the universe or of genus or of species; for there can
 exist a less greatly contracted thing or a more greatly contracted thing
 [than it]. The first general contraction of the universe is through a plu
rality of genera, which must differ by degrees. However, genera exist
 only contractedly in species; and species exist only in individuals,
113
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 1
 which alone exist actually.7 Therefore, just as in accordance with the
 nature of contracted things the individual is positable only within the
 limit of its species, so too no individual can attain to the limit of its
 genus and of the universe. Indeed, among many individual things of
 the same species, there must be a difference of degrees of perfection.
 Hence, with respect to a given species, there will be no maximally per
fect [individual thing], than which a more perfect [individual thing]
 could not be posited; nor is there positable [an individual thing] so im
perfect that a more imperfect is not positable. Therefore, no [individ
ual thing] reaches the limit of its species.
 185
 186
 Therefore, there is only one Limit of species, of genera, or of the
 universe. This Limit is the Center, the Circumference, and the Union
 of all things. And it is not the case that the universe exhausts the in
finite, absolutely maximum power of God so that the universe is an
 unqualifiedly maximum, delimiting the power of God. Hence, it is not
 the case that the universe reaches the limit of Absolute Maximality;
 genera do not reach the limit of the universe; species [do not reach]
 the limit of their genera; and individual things [do not reach] the limit
 of their species. Thus, all things are that-which-they-are in the best
 way [possible for them]8 and between a maximum and a minimum;
 and God is the Beginning, the Middle, and the End of the universe and
 of each thing, so that all things—whether they ascend, descend, or
 tend toward the middle—approach God.9 However, the union of all
 things is through God, so that although all things are different, they
 are united. Accordingly, among genera, which contract the one uni
verse, there is such a union of a lower [genus] and a higher [genus]
 that the two coincide in a third [genus] in between. And among the
 different species there is such an order of combination that the high
est species of the one genus coincides with the lowest [species] of the
 immediately higher [genus], so that there is one continuous and per
fect universe. However, every union is by degrees; and we do not ar
rive at a maximum union, because that is God. Therefore, the differ
ent species of a lower and a higher genus are not united in something
 indivisible which does not admit of greater and lesser degree; rather,
 [they are united] in a third species, whose individuals differ by de
grees, so that no one [of them] participates equally in both [the high
er and the lower species], as if this individual were a composite of
 these [two species]. Instead, [the individual of the third species] con
tracts, in its own degree, the one nature of its own species. As relat
114
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 1
 ed to the other species this [third] species is seen to be composed of
 the lower and of the higher [species], though not equally, since no
 thing can be composed of precise equals; and this third species, which
 falls between the other two, necessarily has a preponderant conformi
ty to one of them—i.e., to the higher or to the lower. In the books of
 the philosophers examples of this are found with regard to oysters,
 sea mussels, and other things.
 187
 188
 Therefore, no species descends to the point that it is the minimum
 species of some genus, for before it reaches the minimum it is changed
 into another species; and a similar thing holds true of the [would-be]
 maximum species, which is changed into another species before it be
comes a maximum species. When in the genus animal the human
 species endeavors to reach a higher gradation among perceptible
 things, it is caught up into a mingling with the intellectual nature; nev
ertheless, the lower part, in accordance with which man is called an
 animal, prevails. Now, presumably, there are other spirits. ([I will dis
cuss] these in Conjectures).10 And because of a certain nature which
 is capable of perception they are said, in an extended sense, to be of
 the genus animal. But since the intellectual nature in them prevails
 over the other nature, they are called spirits rather than animals, al
though the Platonists believe that they are intellectual animals. Ac
cordingly, it is evident that species are like a number series which pro
gresses sequentially and which, necessarily, is finite, so that there is
 order, harmony, and proportion in diversity, as I indicated in Book
 One.11
 It is necessary that, without proceeding to infinity, we reach (1)
 the lowest species of the lowest genus, than which there is not actu
ally a lesser, and (2) the highest [species] of the highest [genus], than
 which, likewise, there is not actually a greater and higher—even
 though a lesser than the former and a greater than the latter could be
 respectively posited. Thus, whether we number upwards or down
wards we take our beginning from Absolute Oneness (which is God)—
 i.e., from the Beginning of all things. Hence, species are as numbers
 that come together from two opposite directions—[ numbers] that pro
ceed from a minimum which is maximum and from a maximum to
 which a minimum is not opposed.12 Hence, there is nothing in the uni
verse which does not enjoy a certain singularity that cannot be found
 in any other thing, so that no thing excels all others in all respects or
 [excels] different things in equal measure. By comparison, there can
115
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 1
 never in any respect be something equal to another;13 even if at one
 time one thing is less than another and at another [time] is greater than
 this other, it makes this transition with a certain singularity, so that it
 never attains precise equality [with the other]. Similarly, a square in
scribed in a circle passes—with respect to the size of the circum
scribing circle—from being a square which is smaller than the circle
 to being a square larger than the circle, without ever arriving at being
 equal to the circle. And an angle of incidence increases from being
 lesser than a right [angle] to being greater [than a right angle] with
out the medium of equality. (Many of these points will be brought out
 in the book Conjectures. )14
 189
 190
 Individuating principles cannot come together in one individual
 in such harmonious comparative relation as in another [individual];
 thus, through itself each thing is one and is perfect in the way it can
 be. And in each species-—e.g., the human species—we find that at a
 given time some individuals are more perfect and more excellent than
 others in certain respects. (For example, Solomon excelled others in
 wisdom, Absalom in beauty, Sampson in strength; and those who ex
celled others more with regard to the intellective part deserved to be
 honored above the others.) Nevertheless, a difference of opinions—in
 accordance with the difference of religions, sects, and regions—gives
 rise to different judgments of comparison (so that what is praisewor
thy according to one [religion, sect, or region] is reprehensible ac
cording to another); and scattered throughout the world are people un
known to us.15 Hence, we do not know who is more excellent than
 the others in the world;16 for of all [individuals] we cannot know even
 one perfectly. God produced this state of affairs in order that each in
dividual, although admiring the others, would be content with himself,
 with his native land (so that his birthplace alone would seem most
 pleasant to him), with the customs of his domain, with his language,
 and so on, so that to the extent possible there would be unity and
 peace, without envy.17 For there can be [peace] in every respect only
 for those who reign with God, who is our peace which surpasses all
 understanding.18
 Chapter Two: The maximum contracted [to a species] is
 also the Absolute [Maximum; it is both]
 Creator and creature.
116
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 2
 It is thoroughly clear that the universe is only contractedly-many
things; these are actually such that no one of them attains to the un
qualifiedly Maximum. I will add something more: if a maximum
 which is contracted to a species could be posited as actually existing,
 then, in accordance with the given species of
 191
 192
 contraction, this maximum would be actually all the things which are
 able to be in the possibility of that genus or species. For the absolutely
 Maximum is actually and absolutely all possible things, and for this
 reason it is absolutely and maximally infinite; similarly, a maximum
 which is contracted to a genus and a species is actually [all] possible
 perfection in accordance with the given contraction; in this [contrac
tion] the maximum is (since a greater cannot be posited) infinite and
 encompasses the entire nature of the given contraction. And just as
 the [Absolute] Minimum coincides with the Absolute Maximum, so
 also the contractedly minimum coincides with the contracted maxi
mum.19 A very clear illustration of this [truth] occurs with regard to
 a maximum line, which admits of no opposition, and which is both
 every figure and the equal measure of all figures, and with which a
 point coincides—as I showed in Book One.20 Hence, if any positable
 thing were the contracted maximum individual of some species, such
 an individual thing would have to be the fullness of that genus and
 species, so that in fullness of perfection it would be the means, form,
 essence, and truth of all the things which are possible in the species.
 This contracted maximum individual would exist above the whole na
ture of that [given] contraction—[exist] as its final goal.21 It would en
fold in itself the entire perfection of the [given contraction]. And it
 would be—above all comparative relation—perfectly equal to each
 given thing [of that species], so that it would not be too great [a mea
sure] for anything nor too small [a measure] for anything but would
 enfold in its own fullness the perfections of all the things [of that
 species].22
 And herefrom it is evident—in conformity with the points
 I exhibited a bit earlier—that the contracted maximum [indi
vidual] cannot exist as purely contracted. For no such [purely
 contracted thing] could attain the fullness of perfection in the
 genus of its contraction. Nor would such a thing qua contract
ed be God, who is most absolute.23 But, necessarily, the con
tracted maximum [individual]—i.e., God and creature—would
 be both absolute and contracted, by virtue of a contraction
 which would be able to exist in itself24 only if it existed in
117
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 2
 193
 194
 Absolute Maximality. (For as I indicated in Book One,25 there
 is only one Maximality through which what is contracted could
 be called maximum.) Suppose Maximum Power united to itself
 this contracted [maximum individual thing—united it] in such
 way that it could not be more united and the respective na
tures still be preserved. [And suppose that], as a result, this
 contracted thing—its contracted nature being preserved (in ac
cordance with which nature it is the contracted and created
 fullness of its species)—were, on account of a hypostatic
 union, both God and all things. [In that case] this admirable
 union would transcend our entire understanding. For if this
 union were conceived as [analogous to the way in which] dif
ferent things are united, then [this conception] would be mis
taken; for Absolute Maximality is not other or different, since it is all
 things. If it were conceived as are two things which previously were
 separate but now are conjoined, [then this conception] would be mis
taken. For divinity does not exist in different ways according to an ear
lier and a later time, nor is it this rather than that; nor was this con
tracted [maximum] able—before the union—to be this or that as is an
 individual person existing in himself; nor are [the divinity and the con
tracted maximum] conjoined as parts in a whole, for God cannot be
 a part.
 Who, then, could conceive of so admirable a union, which is not
 as [the union] of form to matter, since the Absolute God cannot be
 commingled with matter and does not inform [it]. Assuredly, this
 [union] would be greater than all intelligible unions; for what is con
tracted would (since it is maximum) exist there only in Absolute Max
imality—neither adding anything to Maximality (since Maximality is
 absolute) nor passing over into its nature (since it itself is contract
ed). Therefore, what is contracted would exist in what is absolute in
 such way that (1) if we were to conceive of this [being] as [only] God,
 we would be mistaken, since what is contracted does not change its
 nature, and (2) if we were to imagine it as [merely] a creature, we
 would be wrong, since Absolute Maximality, which is God, does not
 relinquish its nature, but (3) if we were to think of [it] as a compos
ite of the two, we would err, since a composition of God and crea
ture, of what is maximally contracted and of what is maximally Ab
solute, is impossible. For such a [being] would have to be conceived
 by us as (1) in such way God that it is also a creature, (2) in such
118
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 2 - 3
 way a creature that it is also Creator, and (3) Creator and creature
 without confusion and without composition. Who, then, could be lift
ed to such a height that in oneness he would conceive diversity and
 in diversity oneness? Therefore, this union would transcend all un
derstanding.
 195
 196
 197
 Chapter Three:
 Only in the case of the nature of
 humanity can there be such a maximum 
[individual].
 With regard to these matters, then, we can readily ask: Of what na
ture should this contracted maximum be? For since it must be the case
 that this maximum is one (just as Absolute Maximality is Absolute
 Oneness) and since, in addition, [this maximum] is contracted to this
 or that: it is first of all evident that the order of things necessarily re
quires that some things be of a lower nature in comparison with oth
ers (as natures devoid of life and intelligence are), that some things
 be of a higher nature (viz., intelligences), and that some things be of
 an in-between [nature]. Therefore, if Absolute Maximality is in the
 most universal way the Being of all things, so that it is not more of
 one thing than of another: clearly, that being which is more common
 to the totality of beings is more uniteable with the [Absolute] Maxi
mum.
 Now, if the nature of lower things is considered and if one of these
 lower beings were elevated unto [Absolute] Maximality, such a being
 would be both God and itself. An example is furnished with regard
 to a maximum line. Since the maximum line would be infinite through
 Absolute Infinity and maximal through [Absolute] Maximality (to
 which, necessarily, it is united if it is maximal): through [Absolute]
 Maximality it would be God ;26 and through contraction it would re
main a line. And so, it would be, actually, everything which a line can
 become. But a line does not include [the possibility of] life or intel
lect. Therefore, if the line would not attain to the fullness of [all] na
tures, how could it be elevated to the maximum gradation? For it
 would be a maximum which could be greater and which would lack
 [some] perfections.
 We must say something similar with regard to the Supreme Na
ture, which does not embrace a lower [nature] in such way that the
 union of the lower [nature] and the higher [nature] is greater than their
119
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 3
 separation. Now, it befits the Maximum—with which the Minimum
 coincides—to embrace one thing in such way that it does not repel
 another thing but is all things together. Therefore, a middle nature,
 which is the means of the union of the lower [nature] and the higher
 [nature], is alone that [nature] which can be suitably elevated unto the
 Maximum by the power of the maximal, infinite God. For since this
 middle nature—as being what is highest of the lower [nature] and what
 is lowest of the higher [nature]—enfolds within itself all natures: if it
 ascends wholly to a union with Maximality, then—as is evident—all
 natures and the entire universe have, in this nature, wholly reached the
 supreme gradation.
 198
 199
 Now, human nature is that [nature] which, though created a little
 lower than the angels, is elevated above all the [other] works of God;27
 it enfolds intellectual and sensible nature and encloses all things with
in itself, so that the ancients were right in calling it a microcosm, or
 a small world. Hence, human nature is that [nature] which, if it were
 elevated unto a union with Maximality, would be the fullness of all the
 perfections of each and every thing, so that in humanity all things
 would attain the supreme gradation. Now, humanity is present only
 contractedly in this or that. Therefore, it would not be possible that
 more than one true human being [homo] could ascend to union with
 Maximality.28 And, assuredly, this being would be a man in such way
 that He was also God and would be God in such way that He was
 also a man. [He would be] the perfection of the universe and would
 hold preeminence in all respects. In Him the least, the greatest, and the
 in-between things of the nature that is united to Absolute Maximality
 would so coincide that He would be the perfection of all things; and
 all things, qua contracted, would find rest in Him as in their own per
fection. The measure of this man would also be the measure of an
 angel (as John says in the Book of Revelation)29 and of each thing;
 for through union with Absolute [Maximality], which is the Absolute
 Being of all things, He would be the universal contracted being of each
 creature. Through Him all things would receive the beginning and the
 end of their contraction, so that through Him who is the contracted
 maximum [individual] all things would go forth from the Absolute
 Maximum into contracted being and would return unto the Absolute
 [Maximum] through this same Medium—[in other words,] through
 [Him who is] the Beginning of their emanation and the End [i. e., the
 Goal] of their return, as it were.
120
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 3
 200
 201
 202
 But [it is] qua Equality-of-being-all-things [that] God is Creator
 of the universe, since the universe was created in accordance with
 Him. Therefore, supreme and maximum Equality-of-being-all-things
absolutely would be that to which the nature of humanity would be
 united, so that through the assumed humanity God Himself would, in
 the humanity, be all things contractedly, just as He is the Equality of
 being all things absolutely. Therefore, since that man would, through
 the union, exist in maximum Equality of Being, He would be the Son
 of God—just as [He would also be] the Word [of God], in whom all
 things were created.30 That is, [He would be] Equality-of-Being,
 which is called Son of God, according to what was previously indi
cated.31 Nevertheless, He would not cease being the son of man, just
 as He would not cease being a man—as will be explained later.32
 The things which can be done by God without any variation,
 diminution, or diminishment of Himself are not repugnant to our most
 excellent and most perfect God; instead, they besuit His immense
 goodness, so that all things were created by Him and in accordance
 with Him in a most excellently and most perfectly congruent order.
 Therefore, since it is not33 the case that anything could be more per
fect if this order were removed34 no one—unless he denied either God
 or that God is most excellent—could reasonably find fault with these
 [created objects]. For all envy is far removed from God, who is
 supremely good and whose work cannot be defective; on the contrary,
 just as He is maximal, so too His work approaches as closely as pos
sible to the maximum. But Maximum Power is not limited except with
 respect to itself; for there is not anything beyond it, and it is infinite.
 Therefore, [Maximum Power] is not limited with respect to any crea
ture; rather, Infinite Power can create a better and more perfect [crea
ture] than any given one.35
 But if a human nature (homo)36 is elevated unto a oneness with
 this Power—so that the human nature is a creature existing not in it
self but in oneness with Infinite Power—then, this Power is limited
 not with respect to the creature but with respect to itself. Now, this
 [work, viz., such an elevated nature] is the most perfect work37 of the
 maximum, infinite, and unlimitable power of God; in it there can be
 no deficiency; otherwise it would not be either Creator or creature.
 How would it be a creature [existing] contractedly from the Divine
 Absolute Being if contraction could not be united with it? Through it
 all things, qua existing,38 would be from Him who exists absolutely;
121
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 3 - 4
 and, qua contracted, they would be from Him to whom contraction is
 supremely united. Thus, God exists first of all as Creator. Secondly,
 [He exists as] God-and-man (a created humanity having been
 supremely assumed into oneness with God); the universal-contraction
of-all-things [i.e., the humanity] is, so to speak, “personally” and “hy
postatically” united with the Equality-of-being-all-things).39 Thus, in
 the third place, all things—through most absolute God and by the me
diation of the universal contraction, viz. . the humanity—go forth into
 contracted being so that they may be that-which-they-are in the best
 order and manner possible.40 But this order should not be considered
 temporally—as if God temporally preceded the Firstborn of creation.41
 And [we ought not to believe] that the Firstborn—viz., God and
 man—preceded the world temporally but [should believe that He pre
ceded it] in nature and in the order of perfection and above all time.
 Hence, by existing with God above time and prior to all things, He
 could appear to the world in the fullness of time,42 after many cycles
 had passed.
 203
 Chapter Four: Blessed Jesus, who is God and man, is the 
[contracted maximum individual].
 In sure faith and by such considerations as the foregoing, we have now
 been led to the place that without any hesitancy at all we firmly hold
 the aforesaid to be most true. Accordingly, I say by way of addition
 that the fullness of time has passed and that ever-blessed Jesus is the
 Firstborn of all creation.
 On the basis of what Jesus, who was a man, divinely and suprahu
manly wrought and on the basis of other things which He, who is
 found to be true in all respects, affirmed about Himself—[things to
 which] those who lived with Him bore witness with their own blood
 and with an unalterable steadfastness that was formerly attested to by
 countless infallible considerations—we justifiably assert that Jesus is
 the one (1) whom the whole creation, from the beginning, expected
 to appear at the appointed time and (2) who through the prophets had
 foretold that He would appear in the world. For He came “in order to
 fill all things,”43 because He willingly restored all [human beings] to
 health. Being powerful over all things, He disclosed all the secrets and
 mysteries of wisdom. As God, He forgave sins, raised the dead, trans
formed nature, commanded spirits, the sea, and the winds. He walked
 on water and established a law in fullness of supply for all laws.44
122
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 4
 According to the testimony of that most unique preacher of truth, Paul,
 who in a rapture was illuminated from on high,45 we have in Him
 complete perfection, as well as redemption and remission of sins. “He
 is the Image of the Invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation because
 in Him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and
 invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all
 things were created through Him and in Him; and He is prior to all
 things, and in Him all things exist. And He is the head of the body,
 the church; He is the Beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, so that
 He holds the primacy in all respects. For it was pleasing that all full
ness dwell in Him and that through Him all things be reconciled unto
 Him.”46
 204
 Such testimonies, together with more elsewhere, are exhibited by
 the saints regarding the fact that He is God and man. In Him the hu
manity was united to the Word of God, so that the humanity existed
 not in itself but in the Word;47 for the humanity could not have existed
 in the supreme degree and in complete fullness otherwise than in the
 divine person of the Son.
 To the end that we may conceive—above all our intellectual com
prehension and in learned ignorance, as it were—this person who unit
ed a human nature to Himself, let us ascend in our understanding and
 consider [the following]: Through all things God is in all things, and
 through all things all things are in God—as I indicated earlier at a
 certain place.48 Therefore, since these [statements] must be considered
 conjointly as “God is in all things in such way that all things are in
 God” and since the Divine Being is of supreme equality and simplic
ity: God, qua present in all things, is not in them according to de
grees—as if communicating Himself by degrees and by parts. How
ever, none of these things can exist without [its respective] difference
 of degree; hence, all things are in God according to themselves with
 a [respective] difference of degree.49 Therefore, since God is in all
 things in such way that all things are in Him, it is evident that God—
 in equality of being all things and without any change in Himself—
 exists in oneness with the maximum humanity of Jesus; for the max
imum human nature can exist in God only maximally.50 And so, in
 Jesus, who is the Equality of being all things, the Eternal Father and
 the Eternal Holy Spirit exist (just as they exist in God-the-Son, who
 is the middle person); and [in Jesus], just as in the Word, all things
 [exist]; and every creature [exists] in the supreme and most perfect hu
manity, which completely enfolds all creatable things. Thus, all full
123
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 4
 ness dwells in Jesus.
 205
 206
 207
 Let us somehow be directed to these [points] by the following ex
ample: Perceptual knowledge is a certain contracted knowledge be
cause the senses attain only to particulars; intellectual knowledge is
 universal knowledge because in comparison with the perceptual it is
 free (absoluta atque abstracta) from contraction to the particular. But
 perception is contracted to various gradations in various ways.
 Through these contractions various species of animals arise accord
ing to grades of nobility and perfection. And although there is no as
cent to the unqualifiedly maximum gradation (as I indicated earlier)51
 nevertheless in that species which is actually supreme within the genus
 animal, viz., the human species, the senses give rise to an animal such
 that it is so animal that it is also intellect. For a man is his own in
tellect. In the intellect the perceptual contractedness is somehow sub
sumed in (suppositatur) the intellectual nature, which exists as a cer
tain divine, separate, abstract being, while the perceptual remains tem
poral and corruptible in accordance with its own nature.
 Therefore, by means of a certain similarity (howbeit a remote one)
 we must reason in a similar way regarding Jesus, in whom the hu
manity—since otherwise it could not be maximal in its own fullness—
 is subsumed in the divinity. For since the intellect of Jesus is most per
fect and exists in complete actuality, it can be personally subsumed
 only in the divine intellect, which alone is actually all things. For in
 all human beings the [respective] intellect is potentially all things; it
 gradually progresses from potentiality to actuality, so that the greater
 it [actually] is, the lesser it is in potentiality. But the maximum intel
lect, since it is the limit of the potentiality of every intellectual nature
 and exists in complete actuality, cannot at all exist without being in
tellect in such way that it is also God, who is all in all. By way of il
lustration: Assume that a polygon inscribed in a circle were the human
 nature and the circle were the divine nature. Then, if the polygon were
 to be a maximum polygon, than which there cannot be a greater poly
gon, it would exist not through itself with finite angles but in the cir
cular shape. Thus, it would not have its own shape for existing—[i.e.,
 it would not have a shape which was] even conceivably separable from
 the circular and eternal shape.52
 Now, the maximality of human nature's perfection is seen in what
 is substantial and essential [about it]—i.e., with respect to the intel
lect, which is served by human nature's corporeal features. Hence, the
124
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 4 - 5
 maximally perfect man is not supposed to be prominent with regard
 to accidental features but with regard to His intellect. For example, it
 is not required that He be a giant or a dwarf or [that He be] of this or
 that size, color, figure—and so on for other accidents. Rather, it is nec
essary only that His body so avoid the extremes that it be a most suit
able instrument for His intellectual nature, to which it be obedient and
 submissive without recalcitrance, complaint, and fatigue. Our Jesus—
 in whom were hidden (even while He appeared in the world) all the
 treasures of knowledge and wisdom,53 as if a light were hidden in
 darkness—is believed to have had, for the sake of His most excellent
 intellectual nature, a most suitable and most perfect body (as also is
 reported by the most holy witnesses of His life).
 208
 209
 Chapter Five: Christ, conceived through the Holy Spirit, 
was born of the Virgin Mary.
 Furthermore, we must consider that since the most perfect humanity,
 which is subsumed upwards, is the terminal contracted precision, it
 does not altogether exceed [the limits of] the species of human na
ture. Now, like is begotten from like; and, hence, the begotten pro
ceeds from the begetter according to a natural comparative relation.
 But since what is terminal is free of termination, it is free of limita
tion and comparative relation. Hence, the maximum human being is
 not begettable by natural means; and yet, He cannot be altogether free
 of origin from that species whose terminal perfection He is. Therefore,
 because He is a human being, He proceeds partly according to human
 nature. And since He is the highest originated [being], most immedi
ately united to the Beginning: the Beginning, from which He most
 immediately exists, is as a creating or begetting [Beginning], i.e., as
 a father; and the human beginning is as a passive [beginning] which
 affords a receiving material. Hence, [He comes] from a mother apart
 from a male seed. But every operation proceeds from a spirit and a
 love which unite the active with the passive, as I earlier indicated in
 a certain passage.54 Hence, necessarily, the maximum operation
 (which is beyond all natural comparative relation and through which
 the Creator is united to the creation and which proceeds from a max
imum uniting Love) is, without doubt, from the Holy Spirit, who is
 absolutely Love. Through the Holy Spirit alone and without the as
sistance of a contracted agent, the mother was able to conceive—with
in the scope of her species—the Son of God the Father. Thus, just as
125
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 5
 God the Father formed by His own Spirit all the things which by Him
 came forth from not-being into being, so by the same most holy Spir
it He did this more excellently when He worked most perfectly [i.e.,
 when He formed Jesus].
 210
 211
 212
 To instruct our ignorance by an example: When some very excel
lent teacher wants to disclose to his students his intellectual, mental
 word (in order that they may feed spiritually upon the conceived truth
 once it has been shown to them), he causes his mental word to be in
dued with sound, since it is not disclosable to his students unless he
 indues it with a perceptible figure. But this cannot be done in any other
 way than through the natural spirit [i.e., breath] of the teacher. From
 the inbreathed air he adapts a vocal figure that befits the mental word.
 To this figure he unites the word in such way that the sound exists with
 the word, so that those listening attain to the word by means of the
 sound.
 By means of this admittedly very remote likeness we are mo
mentarily elevated in our reflection—[elevated] beyond that which we
 can understand. For through the Holy Spirit (who is consubstantial
 with the Father) the Eternal Father of immense goodness (who willed
 to show us the richness of His glory and all the fullness of His knowl
edge and wisdom) indued with human nature the Eternal Word, His
 Son (who is this fullness and the fullness of all things). Making al
lowance for our weaknesses—since we were unable to perceive [the
 Word] in any other way than in visible form and in a form similar to
 ourselves—the Father manifested the Word in accordance with our ca
pability. As a sound [is formed] from inbreathed air, so, as it were, this
 Spirit, through an outbreathing,55 formed from the fertile purity of the
 virginal blood the animal body. He added reason56 so that it would
 be a human nature. [To it] He so inwardly united the Word of God
 the Father that the Word would be human nature's center of existence.
 And all these things were done not serially (as a concept is temporal
ly expressed by us) but by an instantaneous operation—beyond all
 time and in accordance with a willing that befits Infinite Power.57
 No one should doubt that this mother, who was so full of virtue
 and who furnished the material, excelled all virgins in the perfection
 of every virtue and had a more excellent blessing than all other fer
tile women. For this [virgin-mother], who was in all respects foreor
dained to such a unique and most excellent virginal birth, ought right
fully to have been free of whatever could have hindered the purity or
126
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 5
 the vigor, and likewise the uniqueness, of such a most excellent birth.
 For if the Virgin had not been pre-elected, how would she have been
 suited for a virginal birth without a male seed? If she had not been
 superblessed of the Lord and most holy, how could she have been
 made the Holy Spirit's sacristy, in which the Holy Spirit would fash
ion a body for the Son of God. If she had not remained a virgin after
 the birth, she would beforehand have imparted to the most excellent
 birth the center of maternal fertility not in her supreme perfection of
 brightness but dividedly and diminishedly—not as would have befit
 [this] unique, supreme, and so great son. Therefore, if the most holy
 Virgin offered her whole self to God, for whom she also wholly par
took of the complete nature of fertility by the operation of the Holy
 Spirit, then in her the virginity remained—before the birth, during the
 birth, and after the birth—immaculate and uncorrupted, beyond all nat
ural and ordinary begetting.
 213
 214
 Therefore, Jesus Christ—God and man—was born from the Eter
nal Father and from a temporal mother, viz., the most glorious Virgin
 Mary; from the maximum and absolutely most abundant Father and
 from a mother most filled with virginal fertility, He was filled, in the
 fullness of time, with a heavenly blessing. For from the virgin-moth
er [Jesus] was able to exist as a human being only temporally—and
 from God the Father only eternally; but the temporal birth required a
 fullness of perfection in time, just as [it required] in the mother a full
ness of fertility. Therefore, when the fullness of time arrived: since
 [Jesus] could not be born as a human being apart from time, He was
 born at the time and place most fitting thereto and yet most concealed
 from all creatures. For the supreme bounties (plenitudines) are in
comparable with our daily experiences. Hence, no reasoning was able
 to grasp them by any sign, even though by a certain very hidden
 prophetic inspiration certain obscure signs, darkened by human like
nesses, transmitted them; and from these signs the wise could rea
sonably have foreseen that the Word was to be incarnated in the full
ness of time. But the precise place, time, or manner was foreknown
 only to the Eternal Begetter, who ordained that when all things were
 in a state of moderate silence, the Son would in the course of the
 night58 descend from the Heavenly Citadel into the virginal womb and
 would at the ordained and fitting time manifest Himself to the world
 in the form of a servant.
127
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 6
 215
 216
 217
 Chapter Six: The mystery of the death of Jesus Christ.
 It accords with the expression of my intent that a short digression here
 be made—in order to attain more clearly unto the mystery of the
 Cross. There is no doubt that a human being consists of senses, intel
lect, and reason (which is in between and which connects the other
 two).59 Now, order subordinates the senses to reason and reason to
 intellect. The intellect is not temporal and mundane but is free of time
 and of the world. The senses are temporally subject to the motions of
 the world. With respect to the intellect, reason is on the horizon, so
 to speak; but with respect to the senses, it is at the zenith, as it were;
 thus, things that are within time and things that are beyond time co
incide in reason.
 The senses, which belong to the animal [nature], are incapable [of
 attaining unto] supratemporal and spiritual things. Therefore, what is
 animal does not perceive the things which are of God,60 for God is
 spirit and more than spirit.61 Accordingly, perceptual knowledge oc
curs in the darkness of the ignorance of eternal things; and in accor
dance with the flesh it is moved, through the power of concupiscence,
 toward carnal desires and, through the power of anger, toward ward
ing off what hinders it. But supraexcellent reason contains—in its own
 nature and as a result of its capability of participating in the intellec
tual nature—certain laws through which, as ruler over desire's pas
sions,62 it tempers and calms the passions, in order that a human being
 will not make a goal of perceptible things and be deprived of his in
tellect's spiritual desire. And the most important of [these] laws are
 that no one do to another what he would not want done to himself,63
 that eternal things be preferred to temporal things, and clean and holy
 things to unclean and base things. The laws which are elicited from
 reason by the most holy lawgivers and are taught (according to the dif
ference of place and time) as remedies for those who sin against rea
son work together to the foregoing end. Even if the senses were sub
ject to reason in every respect and did not follow after the passions
 which are natural to them, the intellect—soaring higher [than rea
son]—sees that nonetheless man cannot of himself attain to the goal
 of his intellectual and eternal desires. For since from the seed of Adam
 man is begotten with carnal delight64 (in whom, in accordance with
 propagation, the animality prevails over the spirituality): his nature—
 which in its basis of origin is immersed in the carnal delights through
 which the man springs forth into existence by way of a father—re
128
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 6
 mains altogether unable to transcend temporal things in order to em
brace spiritual things. Accordingly, if the weight of carnal delights
 draws reason and intellect downward, so that they consent to these
 motions and do not resist them, it is clear that a man so drawn down
ward and so turned away from God, is altogether deprived of the en
joyment of the most excellent good, which, in the manner of the in
tellectual, is upward and eternal. But if reason governs the senses, still
 it is necessary that the intellect govern reason in order that the intel
lect may adhere—by formed faith65 and above reason—to the Medi
ator, so that it can be drawn unto glory by God the Father.
 218
 219
 Except for Christ Jesus, who descended from Heaven, there was
 never anyone who had [enough] power over himself and over his own
 nature (which in its origin is so subject to the sins of carnal desire) to
 be able, of himself, to ascend beyond his own origin to eternal and
 heavenly things. Jesus is the one who ascended by His own power and
 in whom the human nature (begotten not from the will of the flesh
 but from God)66 was not hindered from mightily returning to God the
 Father. Therefore, through its union [with the divine nature] the human
 nature in Christ was exalted to the Supreme Power and was delivered
 from the weight of temporal and burdensome desires. But Christ the
 Lord willed to mortify completely—and in mortifying to purge—by
 means of His own human body all the sins of human nature which
 draw us toward earthly things. [He did this] not for His own sake
 (since He had committed no sin) but for our sakes, so that all men,
 of the same humanity with Him, would find in Him the complete pur
gation of their sins. The man Christ's voluntary and most innocent,
 most shameful, and most cruel death on the Cross was the deletion
 and purgation of, and the satisfaction for, all the carnal desires of
 human nature. Whatever humanly can be done counter to the love for
 a neighbor is abundantly made up for in the fullness of Christ's love,
 by which He delivered Himself unto death even on behalf of His en
emies. Therefore, the humanity in Christ Jesus made up for all the
 defects of all men. For since it is maximum [humanity], it encom
passes the complete possibility of the species, so that it is such equal
ity-of-being with each man that it is united to each man much more
 closely than is a brother or a very special friend. For the maximali
ty of human nature brings it about that in the case of each man who
 cleaves to Christ through formed faith Christ is this very man67 by
 means of a most perfect union—each's numerical distinctness being
 preserved. Because of this union the following statement of Christ's
129
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 6 - 7
 is true: “Whatever you have done to one of the least of my
 [brethren], you have done to me.”68 And, conversely, whatever Christ
 Jesus merited by His suffering, those who are one with Him also
 merited—different degrees of merit being preserved in accordance
 with the different degree of each [man's] union with Christ through
 faith formed by love. Hence, in Christ the faithful are circumcised;
 in Him they are baptized; in Him they die; in Him they are made
 alive again through resurrection; in Him they are united to God and
 are glorified.69
 220
 221
 Therefore, our justification is not from ourselves but from Christ.
 Since He is complete fullness, in Him we obtain all things, if we pos
sess Him. Since in this life we attain unto Him by formed faith, we
 can be justified only by faith, as I will explain more fully in a later
 section.70
 This is that ineffable mystery of the Cross of our redemption. In
 this mystery Christ showed (in addition to the things already touched
 upon) that truth, justice, and the divine virtues ought to be preferred
 to temporal life—just as eternal things ought to be preferred to tran
sitory things. And [herein He also showed] that in the most perfect
 man supreme constancy, strength, love, and humility ought to be pre
sent—just as the death of Christ on the Cross showed that these and
 all other virtues were maximally present in Jesus, the maximum [in
dividual]. Therefore, the higher a man ascends in the immortal virtues,
 the more Christlike he becomes. For minimum things coincide with
 maximum things. For example, maximum humiliation [coincides] with
 exaltation; the most shameful death of a virtuous man [coincides] with
 his glorious life, and so on—as Christ's life, suffering, and crucifix
ion manifest all these [points] to us.
 Chapter Seven: The mystery of the Resurrection.
 The man Christ, being passible and mortal, could attain unto the glory
 of the Father (who is Immortality itself, since He is Absolute Life) by
 no other way than [the following]: that what was mortal put on im
mortality.71 And this was not at all possible apart from death. For how
 could what is mortal have put on immortality otherwise than by being
 stripped of mortality? How would it be free of mortality except by
 having paid the debt of death? Therefore, Truth itself says that those
 who do not understand that Christ had to die and in this way enter
 into glory are foolish and of slow mind.72 But since I have already
130
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 7
 indicated73 that for our sakes Christ died a most cruel death, I must
 now say the following: since it was not fitting for human nature to be
 led to the triumph of immortality otherwise than through victory over
 death, [Christ] underwent death in order that human nature would rise
 again with Him to eternal life and that the animal, mortal body would
 become spiritual and incorruptible. [Christ] was able to be a true man
 only if He was mortal; and He was able to lead mortal [human] na
ture to immortality only if through death human nature became
 stripped of mortality.
 222
 223
 224
 Hear how beautifully Truth itself, speaking about this [matter], in
structs us when it says: “Except a grain of wheat falling into the
 ground die it remains alone; but if it die it brings forth much fruit.”74
 Therefore, if Christ had always remained mortal (even if He had never
 died), how would He, as a mortal man, have bestowed immortality
 on human nature? Although He would not have died, He would have
 remained a mere deathless mortal. Therefore, through death, He had
 to be freed from the possibility of dying, if He was to bear much
 fruit—so that, when exalted, He would draw all things unto Himself,75
 since His power would be present not only in this corruptible76 world
 and on this corruptible earth but also in incorruptible Heaven. Now,
 if we keep in mind the points that have already been frequently made,
 we will be able in our ignorance to apprehend the present point to
 some extent.
 In what precedes I indicated that the maximum man, Jesus, was
 not able to have in Himself a person that existed separately from the
 divinity. For He is the maximum [human being]. And, accordingly,
 there is a sharing of the respective modes of speaking [about the
 human nature and the divine nature], so that the human things coin
cide with the divine things; for His humanity—which on account of
 the supreme union is inseparable from His divinity (as if it were put
 on and assumed by the divinity)—cannot exist as separate in person.77
 But a man is a union of a body and a soul-the separation of which is
 death. Therefore, because the maximum humanity is subsumed in the
 divine person: at the time of [Jesus's] death neither the soul nor the
 body could have been separated (not even with respect to spatial sep
aration) from the divine person, without which the man [Jesus] did not
 exist.
 Therefore, Christ did not die as if His person had forsaken Him;
 rather He remained hypostatically united with the divinity—there not
131
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 7
 being even spatial separation with regard to the [personal] center, in
 which the humanity was subsumed. (But in accordance with the lower
 nature—which in conformity with the truth of its own nature was able
 to undergo a separation of the soul from the body—a separation was
 made temporally and spatially, so that at the hour of death the soul and
 the body were not together at the same place and at the same time.)
 Therefore, in His body and soul no corruptibility was possible, since
 they were united with eternity. But the temporal birth was subject to
 death and temporal separation, so that when the circle of return (from
 temporal composition to dissolution) was completed and when, fur
thermore, the body was freed from these temporal motions, the truth
 of the humanity that is beyond time and that, as united to the divini
ty, remained undestroyed united (as its truth required) the truth of the
 body with the truth of the soul. Thus, when the shadowy image of the
 truth of the man who appeared in time departed, the true man arose,
 free from all temporal passion. Hence, the same Jesus most truly arose
 above all temporal motions (through a union of soul to body—[a
 union] beyond all temporal motion) and was never again going to die.
 Without this union the truth of the incorruptible humanity would not
 have been unconfusedly and most truly united hypostatically with the
 nature of the divine person.
 225
 Assist your smallness of intellect and your ignorance by Christ's
 example about the grain of wheat.78 In this example the numerical dis
tinctness of the grain is destroyed, while the specific essence remains
 intact; by this means nature raises up many grains. But if the grain
 were maximum and most perfect, then when it died in very good and
 very fertile soil, it could bring forth fruit not only one hundredfold or
 one thousandfold but as manifold as the nature of the species encom
passed in its possibility. This is what Truth means [when it says] that
 [the grain] would bring forth much fruit; for a multitude is a limited
ness without number.
 Therefore, discern keenly: with respect to the fact that the hu
manity of Jesus is considered as contracted to the man Christ, it is like
wise understood to be united also with His divinity. As united with
 the divinity, [the humanity] is fully absolute; [but] as it is considered
 to be that true man Christ, [the humanity] is contracted, so that Christ
 is a man through the humanity. And so, Jesus's humanity is as a medi
um between what is purely absolute and what is purely contracted. Ac
cordingly, then, it was corruptible only in a given respect; but ab
solutely it was incorruptible. Therefore, it was corruptible according
132
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 7 - 8
 to temporality, to which it was contracted; but in accordance with the
 fact that it was free from time, beyond time, and united with the di
vinity, it was incorruptible.
 226
 227
 But truth, as temporally contracted, is a “sign” and an “image,”
 so to speak, of supratemporal truth. Thus, the temporally contracted
 truth of the body is a “shadow,” so to speak, of the supratemporal truth
 of the body. So too, the [temporally] contracted truth of the soul is,
 as it were, a “shadow” of the soul which is free from time. For when
 the soul is in time, where it does not apprehend without images, it
 seems to be the senses or reason rather than the intellect; and when it
 is elevated above time, it is the intellect, which is free from images.
 And since the humanity was inseparably rooted on high in the divine
 incorruptibility: when the temporal, corruptible motion was complet
ed, the dissolution could occur only in the direction of the root of its
 incorruptibility. Therefore, after the end of temporal motion ([an end]
 which was death) and after the removal of all the things which tem
porally befell the truth of the human nature, the same Jesus arose—
 not with a body which was burdensome, corruptible, shadowy, passi
ble (and so on for the other things which follow upon temporal com
position) but with a true body which was glorious, impassible, unbe
hindered, and immortal (as the truth which was free from temporal
 conditions required). Moreover, the truth of the hypostatic union of the
 human nature with the divine nature necessarily required this union [of
 body and soul]. Hence, Blessed Jesus had to arise from the dead, as
 He Himself says when He states: “Christ had to suffer in this way
 and to arise from the dead on the third day.”79
 Chapter Eight: Christ, the Firstfruits of those who sleep,80
 ascended to Heaven.
 Now that the foregoing points have been exhibited, it is easy to see
 that Christ is the Firstborn from the dead.81 For before Him no one
 was able to arise [from the dead]—since human nature had not yet,
 in the course of time, reached a maximum and was not yet united with
 incorruptibility and immortality, as it was in Christ. For all human be
ings were powerless until the coming of Him who said: “I have the
 power to lay down my life and the power to take it up again.”82 There
fore, in Christ, who is the Firstfruits of those who sleep,83 human na
ture put on immortality.But there is only one indivisible humanity and
 specific essence of all human beings. Through it all individual human
133
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 8
 beings are numerically distinct human beings, so that Christ and all
 human beings have the same humanity, though the numerical dis
tinctness of the individuals remains unconfused. Hence, it is evident
 that the humanity of all the human beings who—whether temporally
 before or after Christ---either have existed or will exist has, in Christ,
 put on immortality. Therefore, it is evident that the following inference
 holds: the man Christ arose; hence, after [the cessation of] all motion
 of temporal corruptibility, all men will arise through Him, so that they
 will be eternally incorruptible.
 228
 229
 And although there is a single humanity of all human beings, there
 are various individuating principles which contract it to this or that
 person (suppositum)—so that in Jesus Christ there were only the most
 perfect and powerful principles and those nearest to the essence of the
 humanity that was united with the divinity. Through the power of His
 divinity Christ was able to arise by His own power, which came to
 Him from His divinity; hence, God is said to have raised Him from
 the dead. Since Jesus was God and man, He arose by His own power;
 and-—except in the power of Christ, who is God—no man besides
 Christ can arise as Christ.84 Therefore, Christ is the one through
 whom, according to the nature of His humanity, our human nature has
 contracted immortality and through whom, as well, we (who were
 born altogether subject to motion) will (when motion ceases) rise be
yond time and unto a likeness to Him. This will occur at the end of
 time. But Christ, who was born temporally only insofar as He issued
 forth from a mother, did not, as regards His resurrection, wait for the
 whole course of time [to end], for time did not wholly affect His birth.
 Remember that in Christ human nature put on immortality. There
fore, all of us, whether good or evil, shall arise; but not all of us shall
 be changed through a glory which transforms us—through Christ, the
 Son of God—into adopted sons. Therefore, all shall arise through
 Christ, but not all shall arise as Christ and in Christ through union;
 rather, only those who are Christ's through faith, hope, and love [shall
 so arise].85
 If I am not mistaken, you see that [a religion] which does not em
brace Christ as mediator and savior, as God and man, as the way, the
 truth, and the life86 is not a perfect religion, leading men to the final
 and most coveted goal of peace. Think of how discordant is the be
lief of the Saracens, who (1) affirm that Christ is the maximum and
 most perfect man, born of a virgin and translated alive into Heaven
134
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 8
 but (2) deny that He is God. Surely they have been blinded, because
 they assert what is impossible. But even from the points stated in the
 foregoing manner one who has understanding can see, clearer than
 day, that a man who is not also God cannot be maximum and in all
 respects most perfect, supernaturally born of a virgin. These [Saracens]
 are mindless persecutors of the Cross of Christ, being ignorant of His
 mysteries. They will not taste the divine fruit of His redemption, nor
 are they led to expect it by their law of Mohammed, which promises
 only to satisfy their cravings for pleasure.87 In the hope that these
 cravings are extinguished in us by the death of Christ, we yearn to
 apprehend an incorruptible glory.
 230
 231
 The Jews likewise confess with the Saracens that Messiah is the
 maximum, most perfect, and immortal man; but, held back by the
 same diabolical blindness, they deny that He is God. They also do not
 hope (as do we servants of Christ) to obtain the supreme happiness
 of enjoying God—-even as they also shall not obtain it. And what I
 deem to be even more remarkable is that the Jews, as well as the Sara
cens, believe that there will be a general resurrection but do not admit
 its possibility through the man who is also God. For suppose [the fol
lowing] be granted: that if the motion of generation and corruption
 ceases, the perfection of the universe cannot occur apart from resur
rection, since human nature (which is an intermediate nature) is an
 essential part of the universe; and without human nature not only
 would the universe [not] be perfect but it would not even be a uni
verse. And [suppose it also be granted] that therefore the following is
 necessary: that if motion ever ceases, either the entire universe will
 cease or men will rise to incorruptibility. (In these men the nature of
 all intermediate things is complete, so that the other animals will not
 have to arise, since man is their perfection.) Or [suppose] the resur
rection be said to be going to occur in order that the whole man will
 receive, from a just God, retribution according to his merits. [Even if
 all of the foregoing be said], still, above all, Christ—through whom
 alone human nature can attain unto incorruptibility—must be believed
 to be God and man.
 And so, all those who believe that there is resurrection and who
 deny that Christ is the medium of its possibility have been blinded,
 since faith in resurrection is the affirmation of the divinity and the hu
manity of Christ and of the death and the resurrection of Christ, who,
 according to the aforesaid, is the Firstborn from the dead. For He arose
135
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 8 - 9
 in order thereby to enter into glory through ascending to Heaven. I
 think that this ascent must be understood to have been above all mo
tion of corruptibility and all influence of the heavens. For although in
 accordance with His divinity Christ is everywhere, nevertheless His
 place is more properly said to be where there never is change, emo
tion, sadness, and other [accidents] which befall temporality. And we
 say that this place of eternal joy and peace is beyond the heavens, al
though it is not apprehensible, describable, or definable in respect to
 space.
 232
 233
 Christ is the center and the circumference of intellectual nature;88
 and since the intellect encompasses all things, Christ is above all
 things. Nevertheless, as if in His own temple, He dwells in the holy
 rational souls and in the holy intellectual spirits, which are the heav
ens, declaring His glory. So, then, we understand that Christ—in that
 He “ascended above all the heavens, in order to fill all things”—as
cended above all space and time unto an incorruptible mansion, be
yond everything which can be spoken of.89 Since He is God, He is
 all in all. Since He is Truth, He reigns in the intellectual heavens. And
 since as the life of all rational spirits He is their- center, it is not the
 case that, with respect to location, He is seated on the circumference
 rather than at the center. And, therefore, He who is the “Fount of
 life”90 for souls, as well as their goal, affirms that the Kingdom of
 Heaven is also within men.91
 Chapter Nine: Christ is judge of the living and the dead.
 Who is a judge more just than He who is Justice itself? For Christ,
 the head and the source of every rational creature, is Maximal Rea
son, from which all reason derives. But reason92 judges discrimina
tively. Hence, Christ—who (while remaining God, who is the rewarder
 of all) assumed rational human nature with all rational creatures—is
 rightfully the judge of the living and the dead. But through Himself
 and in Himself Christ judges—above all time—all things. For He em
braces all creatures, since He is the maximum human being, in whom,
 because He is God, all things exist. As God He is Infinite Light in
 which there is no darkness.93 This Light illumines all things, so that
 in it all things are most manifest to it. For this infinite, intellectual
 Light enfolds, beyond all time, what is present as well as what is past,
 what is living as well as what is dead-just as corporeal light is the basis
136
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 9
 (hypostasis) of all colors. But Christ is as purest fire, which is insep
arable from light and which exists not in itself but in light. And He is
 that spiritual fire of life and understanding which—as consuming94 all
 things and taking all things into itself—tests and judges all things, as
 does the judgment of material fire, which examines all things.
 234
 235
 All rational spirits are judged in Christ, as what is heatable by fire
 [is judged] in fire.95 Of these [heatable things] the one, if it remains
 in the fire for a long time, is transformed into the likeness of fire (e.g.,
 most excellent and most perfect gold is so gold and so intensely fire
hot that it appears to be no more gold than fire); but some other thing
 does not participate in the intensity of the fire to such a degree (e.g.,
 purified silver, bronze, or iron); nevertheless, they all seem to be trans
formed into fire, although each [is transformed] in its own degree. And
 this judgment belongs only to the fire, not to the things heated by fire,
 since each thing heated by fire apprehends in each other such thing
 only that very radiant fire and not the differences between each such
 thing. By comparison, if we were to see gold, silver, and copper fused
 in a maximum fire, we would not apprehend the differences of the
 metals after they had been transformed into the form of fire. Howev
er, if the fire were an intellectual [being], it would know the degrees
 of perfection of each [metal] and to what extent (according to these
 degrees) the fire's capability for intensity would be differently present
 in each thing. Hence, there are certain things—things heatable by fire,
 continuing incorruptibly in fire, and capable of receiving light and
 heat—which on account of their purity are transformable into the like
ness of fire; and this occurs differently, according to greater and less
er degrees. But there are other things which, because of their impuri
ty, are not transformable into light, even if they are heatable. In a sim
ilar manner, Christ, who is judge, according to one and the same most
 simple judgment, imparts most justly and without envy, at one instant
 and to all [rational spirits] (imparts not in the order of time but in the
 order of nature) the “warmth,” so to speak, of created reason—in order
 to bestow, by the heat which is received, a divine, intellectual light
 from on high. Thus, God is all things in all things;96 and all things
 are in God through the Mediator; and [every rational spirit] is equal
 to God to the extent that this is possible in accordance with each's ca
pability.
 But some things, because of the fact that they are more unified
 and pure, are able to receive not only heat but also light; other things
 are barely [able to receive] heat and are not [at all able to receive]
137
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 9
 236
 237
 light. This results from [the disposition or] indisposition of the [re
ceiving] objects. Hence, since that Infinite Light is Eternity itself and
 Truth itself, it is necessary that a rational creature desiring to be il
lumined by that Light turn to true and eternal things, which are above
 these mundane and corruptible things. Corporeal and spiritual things
 are related to each other as contraries. For example, vegetative power
 is corporeal; it converts nourishment which is received from without
 into the nature of that which is nourished; an animal is not convert
ed into bread but conversely. However, when an intellectual spirit—
 whose operation is supratemporal and, as it were, on the horizon of
 eternity—turns toward eternal things, it cannot convert these things
 into itself, since they are eternal and incorruptible. But since it itself
 is incorruptible, it also is not converted into these things in such way
 that it ceases to be an intellectual substance. Instead, it is converted
 into these [in such way] that it is absorbed into a likeness to the eter
nal things—[absorbed], however, according to degrees, so that the
 more fervently it is turned toward these things, the more fully it is
 perfected by them and the more deeply its being is hidden in the Eter
nal Being. But since Christ is immortal and still lives and is still life
 and truth, whoever turns to Him turns to life and truth. And the more
 ardently [he does] this, the more he is elevated from mundane and
 corruptible things unto eternal things, so that his life is hidden in
 Christ.97 For the virtues are eternal: justice remains forever, and so
 too does truth.
 Whoever turns to the virtues walks in Christ's ways, which are
 the ways of purity and immortality. Now, the virtues are divine illu
minations. Therefore, if during this life someone turns by faith to
 Christ, who is virtue, then when he is freed from this temporal life,
 he will exist in purity of spirit, so that he can enter into the joy of
 eternal possession. But the turning of our spirit occurs when in ac
cordance with all its intellectual powers our spirit turns by faith to the
 eternal and most pure truth (which it places before all else) and when
 it chooses and loves such truth as being alone worthy to be loved. For
 to turn by most assured faith to the truth which is Christ is to forsake
 this world and to tread on it in victory. But to love Christ most ardently
 is to attain unto Him through spiritual motion, for He is not only lov
able but is Love itself. For when through the grades of love the spir
it attains unto Love itself, it is plunged into Love itself—not tempo
rally but above all time and mundane motion.
138
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 9 - 10
 238
 239
 240
 Therefore, just as everyone who loves is within love, so all who
 love truth are in Christ. And just as everyone-who-loves loves through
 love, so all who love truth love it through Christ. Hence, no one knows
 the truth unless the spirit of Christ is in him. And just as it is impos
sible that there be a lover without love, so it is impossible that some
one have God without [having] the spirit of Christ; only in this spirit
 can we worship God. Accordingly, unbelievers—who are unconvert
ed to Christ and who are incapable of receiving the light of trans
forming glory—have already been condemned to darkness and to the
 shadow of death, since they have turned from the life which is
 Christ.98 Through union [with Christ] all [who love Christ] are glori
ously filled with His fullness alone.99 Later, when I shall speak about
 the church, I will add-—on the same foundation and for the sake of
 our consolation—some more points regarding this union.100
 Chapter Ten: The Judge's sentence.
 It is evident that no one among mortals comprehends the judgment and
 sentence of this judge. For since it is beyond all time and motion, it
 is not disclosed by comparative or inferential investigation or by vocal
 utterance or by such signs as indicate a delay or a protraction. But
 just as all things were created in101 the Word (for He spoke and they
 were created),102 so in the same Word, which is also called Reason,
 all things are judged. And there is no interval between the sentence
 and its execution, but what happens at an instant is the following: the
 resurrection and the securing of the respective end (viz., glorification
 with regard to the translation of the sons of God and damnation with
 regard to the exclusion of the unconverted) are not separated by a mo
ment of time—[not] even by an indivisible [moment].
 The intellectual nature, which is beyond time and is not subject
 to temporal corruption,103 contains, in accordance with its nature, in
corruptible forms—e.g., mathematical forms, which in their own way
 are abstract (but are also present in natural objects) and which are hid
den away in the intellectual nature and are easily transformed.104
 These [incorruptible forms] are, for us, guiding signs of the intellec
tual nature's incorruptibility; for [the intellect is] the incorruptible
 locus of incorruptible [forms]. Now, by its natural movement [the in
tellectual nature] is moved toward most abstract truth—as toward the
 goal of its own desires and toward the ultimate and most delectable
 object. And since such an object as this is all things, because it is God:
139
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 10
 241
 242
 the intellect—immortal and incorruptible—is not satisfiable until it
 attains unto God, for it is fully satisfied only by an eternal object.
 But suppose that an intellect, upon being freed from this body
 in which it is subject to temporal thoughts, does not attain the desired
 goal but rather falls into ignorance when it should be seeking the
 truth and when with utmost desire it should be desiring nothing other
 than to apprehend the truth, not by a symbolism or signs but as
suredly and “face to face.”105 In that case, since (because of its turn
ing away from truth at the hour of separation and because of its turn
ing to what is corruptible) it falls toward corruptible objects of de
sire, toward uncertainty and confusion, and into the dark chaos of
 pure possibility (where there is no actual certainty): the intellect is
 rightly said to have descended unto intellectual death. Indeed, for the
 intellectual soul to understand is for it to be; and for it to understand
 the object of desire is for it to live. Hence, just as, for it, eternal life
 is finally to apprehend the unchanging, eternal object of its desire, so,
 for it, eternal death is to be separated from this unchanging object
 of desire and to be hurled into the chaos of confusion, where in its
 own manner it is eternally tormented by fire. [This manner is] gras
pable by us only analogously to the torment of someone who is de
prived of vital nourishment and health—and [deprived] not only of
 these but also of the hope of ever obtaining them, so that he is ever
 dying an agonizing death, without extinction and termination.
 The foregoing is a life wretched beyond what can be conceived.
 It is life in such way that it is death; it is existence in such way that
 it is not-existence; it is understanding in such way that it is lack of
 understanding. Now, earlier106 I proved [all of the following]: The
 resurrection of men occurs above all motion and time and quantity
 and other [determinations] which are subject to time, so that the cor
ruptible is resolved into the incorruptible and the animal is resolved
 into the spiritual. Accordingly, a whole [resurrected] man is his in
tellect, which is spirit; and a true body is engulfed by his spirit. Thus,
 the body does not exist in itself (i.e., in its corporeal, quantitative, and
 temporal relations) but exists as translated into the spirit (i.e., exists
 in a manner contrary to our present body). Here [in this lifetime] not
 the intellect but the body is seen, and in the body the intellect seems
 to be imprisoned, as it were; but there [in the resurrected life] the
 body exists in the spirit, just as here the spirit exists in the body. Ac
cordingly, as here the soul is weighed down by the body, so there the
140
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 10 - 11
 243
 244
 body is lightened by the spirit. Therefore, [in accordance with the
 foregoing proven points]: as the spiritual joys of the intellectual life
 are the greatest (which joys are participated in by even the body,
 which is glorified within the spirit), so the infernal sorrows of spiri
tual death are the greatest (which sorrows are experienced even by
 the body., which is in the spirit). And since our God (who is under
stood to be eternal life) is comprehensible [only] above all under
standing,107 these eternal joys which exceed our entire understand
ing are greater than can be conveyed by any sign; likewise, the pun
ishments of the damned occur beyond all conceivable and describable
 punishments. Therefore, with regard to all the musical and harmonic
 signs of joy, delight, and glory which, as signs for thinking what is
 known to us, are found to be indicators-of-eternal-life handed down
 by the Fathers: they are very remote perceptible signs—infinitely dis
tant from the intellectual [realities], which are not perceivable by any
 imaging. Similarly, with regard to the punishments of Hell, which are
 likened to a fire of the element sulphur, to a fire from pitch, and to
 other perceptible torments: these latter do not admit of any compar
ison with those fiery intellectual miseries from which Jesus Christ,
 our life and our salvation, deigns to save us. He is blessed forever.
 Amen.
 Chapter Eleven: The mysteries of faith.
 All our forefathers unanimously maintain that faith is the beginning
 of understanding. For in every branch of study certain things are pre
supposed as first principles.108 They are grasped by faith alone, and
 from them is elicited an understanding of the matters to be treated. For
 everyone who wills to ascend to learning must believe those things
 without which he cannot ascend. For Isaiah says “Unless you believe,
 you will not understand.”109 Therefore, faith enfolds within itself
 everything which is understandable. But understanding is the unfold
ing of faith. Therefore, understanding is guided by faith, and faith is
 increased by understanding. Hence, where there is no sound faith,
 there is no true understanding. Thus, it is evident what kind of con
clusion erroneous beginnings and a weakness of foundation imply. But
 there is no more perfect faith than Truth itself, which is Jesus.110
 Who does not understand that right faith is a most excellent gift
 of God?111 The Apostle John states that faith in the incarnation of the
 Word of God leads us unto the truth in order that we may be made
141
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 11
 sons of God.112 At the outset John plainly discloses this [faith]; then
 in accordance with it he expounds the many works of Christ, in order
 that the intellect may be illumined in faith; finally, he draws the con
clusion when he says, “These things were written in order that you
 would believe that Jesus is the Son of God.”113
 245
 246
 But soundest faith-in-Christ, made steadfastly firm in simplicity,
 can, in accordance with previously given instruction in ignorance, be
 increased and unfolded in ascending degrees. For although hidden
 from the wise, the very great and very deep mysteries of God are re
vealed, through faith in Jesus, to the small and humble inhabitants of
 the world.114 For Jesus is the one in whom all the treasures of wis
dom and knowledge are hidden,115 and without Him no one can do
 anything.116 For He is the Word and the Power through which God
 (who as alone the Most High, having power over all things in heav
en and on earth) created even the aeons. Since God is not knowable
 in this world117 (where by reason and by opinion or by doctrine we
 are led, with symbols, through the more known to the unknown), He
 is apprehended only where persuasive considerations cease and faith
 appears. Through faith we are caught up, in simplicity, so that being
 in a body incorporeally (because in spirit) and in the world not mun
danely but celestially we may incomprehensibly contemplate Christ
 above all reason and intelligence, in the third heaven of most simple
 intellectuality. Thus, we see even the following: viz., that because of
 the immensity of His excellence God cannot be comprehended. And
 this is that learned ignorance through which most blessed Paul, in as
cending, saw that when he was being elevated more highly to Christ,
 he did not know Christ, though at one time he had known only
 Christ.118
 Therefore, we who are believers in Christ are led in learned ig
norance unto the Mountain that is Christ and that we are forbidden to
 touch with the nature of our animality.119 And when we attempt to
 view this Mountain with our intellectual eye, we fall into an obscur
ing mist, knowing that within this mist is the Mountain on which,
 alone, all living beings possessed of an intellect are well pleased to
 dwell. If we approach this Mountain with greater steadfastness of
 faith, we will be snatched from the eyes of those who live sensually,
 so that with an inward hearing we will perceive the sounds and thun
derings and frightening signs of its majesty. [And thus too] we will
 easily perceive that Christ alone is Lord, whom all things obey, and
142
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 11
 we will progressively come to certain of His incorruptible footprints
 (as if [coming to] certain most divine marks). At this point we [shall]
 hear, in the holy instruments and signs of the prophets and the saints,
 the voice not of mortal creatures but of God Himself; and we [shall]
 see God more clearly, as if through a more rarefied cloud.
 247
 248
 Thereupon the believers, who continue to ascend with more ardent
 desire, are caught up unto simple intellectuality; and leaping beyond
 all perceptible things, they pass as if from sleeping to waking, from
 hearing to seeing. There they see things which, because they are things
 beyond all hearing and all vocal instruction, cannot be revealed. But
 should it be claimed that they are there revealed, then the unsayable
 would [there] be said and the unhearable would [there] be heard—
 even as the invisible is there seen. For Jesus-who is blessed forever,120
 who is the goal not only of all understanding (because He is Truth) but
 also of all sensing (because He is Life), and who, further, is both the
 goal of all being (because He is Being itself) and the perfection of
 every creature (because He is God and man)—is, as the goal of every
 utterance, there heard incomprehensibly. For every utterance has come
 forth from Him and terminates in Him. Whatever truth is in an utter
ance is from Him. Every utterance has as its goal instruction; there
fore, [every utterance] has as its goal Him who is Wisdom itself.
 “Whatever things were written were written for our instruction.”121
 Utterances are befigured in written characters. “By the Word of the
 Lord the heavens were established.”122 Therefore, all created things
 are signs of the Word of God. Every corporeal utterance is a sign of
 a mental word. The cause of every corruptible mental word is an in
corruptible word, viz., a concept. Christ is the incarnated Concept of
 all concepts,123 for He is the Word made flesh.124 Therefore, Jesus is
 the goal of all things.
 Such things are progressively manifested to one who ascends to
 Christ by faith. The divine efficacy of this faith is inexplicable. For if
 this faith is great, it unites the believer with Jesus in order that he may
 be above all things which do not exist in oneness with Jesus Himself.
 If the [believer's] faith is whole, then with the power of Jesus, with
 whom he is united, he commands even the evil spirits and has power
 over nature and motion. And it is not he himself but rather Jesus
 who—in him and through him—works wondrous things, as the deeds
 of the saints bear witness.
 It is necessary that perfect faith in Christ be—to the extent that this
143
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 11
 249
 250
 is really possible—most pure, maximum, and formed by love. For this
 faith does not allow anything to be mixed with it, since it is faith in
 the purest Truth's power for all things. In the preceding [sections] there
 can very frequently be found repeated [the doctrine] that the mini
mum coincides with the maximum. This doctrine applies to the faith
 which is unqualifiedly maximum in actuality and in power. [This max
imum faith] cannot be in a pilgrim, who is still not a full attainer [of
 his goal], as was Jesus. However, the pilgrim must will actually to
 have for himself maximum faith in Christ—[to have it] to such an ex
tent that his faith will be elevated to such a level of indubitable cer
tainty that it will also be not at all faith but supreme certainty devoid
 of all doubt in any respect whatsoever. This is the mighty faith which
 is so maximal that it is also minimal,125 so that it embraces all the
 things which are believable with regard to Him who is Truth. Even
 if, perhaps, one man's faith does not reach the level of another
 man's,126 because of the impossibility of there being equality (just as
 one visible object cannot be seen in equal measure by many [differ
ent perceivers]), nevertheless it is necessary that each [person], as best
 he can, actually believe maximally. And thus, [as regards] him who
 in relation to others would attain a faith scarcely [the size of] a grain
 of mustard: his faith would be of such immense power that he would
 find obedience even on the part of the mountains.127 For he would
 command with the power of the Word of God, with whom he would
 be (as much as he could) maximally united by faith and whom noth
ing could resist.
 Notice how great your intellectual spirit's power is in the power
 of Christ, provided [your spirit] cling to Him above all else, so that it
 be nourished by Him—being, through union, subsumed in Him (its nu
merical distinctness being preserved) as in its own life. But since this
 occurs only through the conversion of the intellect (which the senses
 obey) to Christ by maximum faith, this [faith] must be formed by unit
ing love. For without love faith cannot be maximum. For if every liv
ing thing loves to live and if every understanding thing loves to un
derstand, how can Jesus be believed to be immortal life and infinite
 truth if He is not loved supremely? For life per se is lovable; and if
 Jesus is most greatly believed to be eternal life, He cannot fail to be
 loved. For without love faith is not living but dead and is not faith at
 all. But love is the form of faith, giving to faith true being; indeed,
 love is the sign of most steadfast faith. Therefore, if for the sake of
 Christ all things are set aside, and if in relation to Christ the body and
144
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 11
 251
 252
 253
 the soul are counted as nothing: this is a sign of maximum faith.
 Moreover, faith cannot be great apart from the holy hope of en
joying Jesus. For how would anyone have assured faith if he did not
 hope for what was promised him by Christ? If he does not believe
 that he will have the eternal life promised by Christ to believers, in
 what sense does he believe Christ? Or how is it that he believes that
 Christ is truth if he does not have assured hope in His promises? How
 would he choose death for Christ's sake if he did not hope for im
mortality? Because the believer believes that [Christ] does not for
sake those who hope in Him but rather bestows on them eternal hap
piness: on account of such a great reward of recompense he counts it
 as a small matter to endure all things for Christ.128
 Assuredly, the power of faith is great: it makes a man Christlike,
 so that he abandons perceptible things, divests himself of the conta
minating things of the flesh, walks in the ways of God with rever
ence, follows the steps of Christ with joy, willingly bears a cross with
 exaltation—so that he exists in the flesh as a spirit for whom (on ac
count of Christ) this world is death and for whom removal from this
 world (in order to be with Christ) is life. Who, in your opinion, is this
 spirit in which Christ dwells by faith? What is this admirable gift of
 God which is such that we, who on this pilgrimage are constituted with
 frail flesh, can by the power of faith be elevated to this power over129
 all the things which are not Christ through union? Be aware that as
 someone's flesh is progressively and gradually mortified by faith, he
 progressively ascends to oneness with Christ, so that he is absorbed
 into Christ by a deep union—to the extent that this is possible on [this
 pilgrim's] pathway. Leaping beyond all things which are visible and
 mundane, he obtains the full perfection of his nature. This is the per
fect nature which we who have been transformed into Christ's image
 can obtain in Christ after the flesh and sin have been mortified. It is
 not that fantastic [nature] of the magicians, who allege that by faith
 and through certain practices a man ascends to a nature of influential
 spirits who are akin to himself—so that by the power of such spirits,
 with which the magicians themselves are united by faith, they perform
 many special wonders as regards fire or water or musical knowledge,
 visible transformations, the revealing of hidden matters, and the like.
 For it is evident that with regard to all these [wonders] there is de
ception as well as a departure from real life and from truth. Accord
ingly, such [magicians] are bound to alliances, and to pacts of unity,
145
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 11 - 12
 with evil spirits. [They are bound] in such way that that which they
 believe by faith they display by deed in incense-offerings and acts of
 worship due only to God. These they devote (with great observance
 and veneration) to spirits [whom they regard] as able to grant their
 requests and as able to be summoned forth by these means. United in
 this way with a spirit to whom they will also cling while eternally sep
arated from Christ and in torment, they sometimes do obtain, by faith,
 these transitory objects of desire.
 Blessed is God, who by His own son has redeemed us from the
 darkness of such great ignorance130 in order that we may discern to
 be false and deceptive all the things which are somehow done by a
 mediator other than Christ, who is truth, and by a faith other than
 [faith] in Jesus. For there is only one Lord—Jesus—who is powerful
 over all things, who fills us with every blessing, and who alone caus
es our every deprivation to be filled to overflowing.
 254
 255
 Chapter Twelve: The church.
 Although an understanding of the church of Christ can be obtained
 from what has already been said, I will add a word or two in order that
 nothing will be missing from my work.
 Since it is necessary that the faith in different men be of unequal
 degree and therefore admit of greater and lesser degree,131 no one can
 attain to maximum faith, than which there can be no greater power.
 (Similarly, no one [can attain] to maximum love either.) For if maxi
mum faith, which could not be a greater power, were present in a pil
grim, he would also have to be an attainer [of his pilgrim's goal].132
 For just as the maximum in a genus is the supreme goal of the genus,
 so it is the beginning of a higher [genus]. Accordingly, unqualifiedly
 maximum faith cannot be present in anyone who is not also an attainer
 [of his pilgrim's goal]. Similarly, unqualifiedly maximum love cannot
 be present in a lover who is not also the beloved. Accordingly, nei
ther unqualifiedly maximum faith nor unqualifiedly maximum love
 befit anyone other than Jesus Christ, who was both pilgrim and at
tainer, both loving man and beloved God. But all things are included
 in the maximum, since the maximum encompasses all things. Hence,
 all true faith is included in Christ Jesus's faith,133 and all true love is
 included in Christ's love—though distinctions of degree always re
main.
 And since these distinct degrees are below the maximum and
146
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 12
 above the minimum, no one—even if he actually has maximum faith
 in Christ [in the sense of having] as much as he can-—can attain unto
 that [unqualifiedly] maximum faith in Christ through which he would
 understand Christ as God and man. And no one can love Christ so
 much that Christ could not be loved even more; for Christ is love
 (amor et caritas) and is therefore infinitely lovable. Hence, no one ei
ther in this life or the next can so love Christ that he would therefore
 be Christ and man. For all who are united with Christ (differences of
 degree remaining) either in this life through faith and love or in the
 next life through attainment and enjoyment are united in the follow
ing way: they could not be more greatly united and still have their re
spective difference of degree remain. Thus, none [of them] exist in
 themselves and apart from that union, and yet none [of them] lose their
 respective degree on account of the union.
 256
 Therefore, this union is a church, or congregation, of many in
 one—just as many members are in one body. each member existing
 with its own role. (In the body, one member is not the other member;
 but each member is in the one body, and by the mediation of the body
 it is united with each other member.134 No member of the body can
 have life and existence apart from the body, even though in the body
 one member is all the others only by the mediation of the body.)
 Therefore, as we journey here below, the truth of our faith can exist
 only in the spirit of Christ—the order of believers remaining, so that
 in one Jesus there is diversity in harmony. And once we are freed from
 this church militant: when we arise, we can arise only in Christ, so that
 in this way there will also be one church of those who are triumphant,
 each existing in his own order. And at that time the truth of our flesh
 will exist not in itself but in the truth of Christ's flesh; and the truth
 of our body will exist in the truth of Christ's body; and the truth of
 our spirit will exist in the truth of Christ Jesus's spirit—as branches
 exist in the vine.135 Thus, Christ's one humanity will be in all men,
 and Christ's one spirit will be in all spirits—so that each [believing
 individual] will be in Christ, so that from all [members] there will be
 one Christ. And then whoever in this life receives any one of those
 who are Christ's receives Christ; and what is done to one of the least
 of these is done to Christ.136 (By comparison, whoever injures Plato's
 hand injures Plato; and whoever harms the smallest toe harms the
 whole man.) And whoever rejoices in Heaven over the least one re
joices over Christ and sees in each one Jesus, through whom [he sees]
 Blessed God. Thus, through His son, our God will be all things in all
147
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 12
 things;137 and in His son and through Him each [believer] will be with
 God and with all things, so that [each's] joy will be full, free of all
 envy and deprivation.
 257
 258
 And since faith can be continually increased in us while we jour
ney here below, so also [can] love. Although each [believer] can ac
tually have such a degree [of faith and love] that of himself, as he
 then is, he cannot actually have a greater degree, nevertheless when
 he has one degree, he has a potency for another. Yet, no such pro
gression can be made—through a common basis [of comparison]—
 unto infinity. Hence, we ought to endeavor to have our capability ac
tualized by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, so that in this way we
 may, through Him who is Faith and Love, progress from virtue to
 virtue and from degree [of intensity] to degree [of intensity]. Without
 Him we can do nothing of ourselves qua of ourselves.138 Rather, all
 that we can do we can do in Him who alone is able to supply what
 we lack in order that on the day of resurrection we may be found to
 be a whole and noble member of Him. And believing and loving with
 all our might, we can no doubt by constant prayer obtain this gracious
 increase of faith and love and ascend confidently to His throne. For
 He is most gracious and lets no one be deceived by his holy desire.
 If you will reflect upon these indeed deep [matters], you will be
 overwhelmed with an admirable sweetness of spirit. For with an inner
 relishing you will scent, as in the case of a very fragrant incense, God's
 inexpressible goodness. God, passing over to you, will supply you
 with this goodness; you will be filled with Him when His glory shall
 appear.139 You will be filled, that is, without surfeit; for this immor
tal food is life itself. And just as the desire-for-living always increas
es, so the food of life is always consumed without being transformed
 into the nature of the consumer. For otherwise it would be loathsome
 food which would weigh down and which could not bestow immor
tal life because it would be deficient in itself and would be trans
formed into the one who is nourished. Now, our intellectual desire is
 [the desire] to live intellectually—i.e., to enter further and further into
 life and joy. And since that life is infinite: the blessed, still desirous,
 are brought further and further into it. And so, they are filled-being,
 so to speak, thirsty ones drinking from the Fount of life. And because
 this drinking does not pass away into a past (since it is within eterni
ty), the blessed are ever drinking and ever filled; and yet, they have
 never drunk and have never been filled.
148
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 12
 259
 260
 Blessed is God, who has given us an intellect which cannot be
 filled in the course of time. Since the intellect's desire does not come
 to an end, the intellect—on the basis of its temporally insatiable de
sire—apprehends itself as beyond corruptible time and as immortal.
 And the intellect recognizes that it cannot be satisfied by the intellec
tual-life-it-desires except during the enjoyment of the maximum, most
 excellent, and never-failing good. This enjoyment does not pass away
 into a past, because the appetite does not fade away during the en
joyment. [The situation is] as if—to use an illustration from the
 body—someone hungry were seated at the table of a great king, where
 he was supplied with the food he desired, so that he did not seek any
 other food. The nature of this food would be [such] that in filling him
 up it would also whet his appetite. If this food were never deplenished,
 it is obvious that the perpetual consumer would always be filled,
 would always desire this same food, and would always willingly be
 brought to the food. And so, he would always be able to eat; and, after
 having eaten, he would still be able to be led to the food with whet
ted appetite. Such, then, is the capability of the intellectual nature, so
 that in receiving into itself life, it is transformed into life in accordance
 with its own transformable nature—just as air, in receiving into itself
 the sun's ray, is transformed into light. Accordingly, since the intel
lect is of a nature which is turnable toward the intelligible, it under
stands only universal, incorruptible, abiding things.140 For the incor
ruptible truth is the object of the intellect-unto which object the intel
lect is brought intellectually. Indeed, in quiet tranquility it apprehends
 this truth in eternity and in Christ Jesus.
 This is the church of the triumphant,141 in which our God, who
 is blessed forever, is present. Here the true man Christ Jesus is unit
ed, in supreme union, with the Son of God—in so great a union that
 the humanity exists only in the divinity; it is present in the divinity
 by means of an ineffable hypostatic union—[present] in such way that
 it cannot be more highly and more simply united if the truth [i.e., the
 reality] of the nature of the humanity is to remain. Then every ratio
nal nature—provided that in this life it turn to Christ with supreme
 faith, hope, and love—is united with Christ the Lord (though the per
sonal truth of each nature remains) to the following extent: (1) that
 all the angels and all the men (each [man] having the truth of his body
 absorbed and attracted through his spirit) exist only in Christ, through
 whom they exist in God, so that each of the blessed, having the truth
of-his-own-being preserved, exists in Christ Jesus as Christ and—
149
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 12
 261
 262
 through Christ—in God as God; and (2) that God, while remaining the
 Absolute Maximum, exists in Christ Jesus as Jesus and, through Jesus,
 in all things as all things. The church cannot in some other way be
 more one. For “church” bespeaks a oneness of many [members]-—
 each of whom has his personal truth preserved without confusion of
 natures or of degrees; but the more one the church is, the greater it
 is; hence, this church—[viz.J the church of the eternally triumphant—
 is maximal, since no greater union of the church is possible.
 Therefore, consider now how great is the following union: [viz.J
 where there is found (1) the divine, absolute maximum Union, (2) the
 union, in Jesus, of the deity and the humanity, and (3) the union of
 the church of the triumphant, [i.e., the union] of Jesus's deity and the
 blessed. The Absolute Union is neither a greater nor a lesser [union]
 than the union of the natures in Jesus or [the union] of the blessed in
 Heaven. For it is the maximum Union which is (a) the Union of all
 unions and (b) that which is complete union. It does not admit of de
grees of more or less, and it proceeds from Oneness and Equality—
 as is indicated in Book One. And the union of the natures in Christ is
 neither a greater nor a lesser [union] than the oneness of the church
 of the triumphant; for since it is the maximum union of the natures,
 it therefore does not admit of degrees of more and less; hence, all the
 different things which are united receive their oneness from the max
imum union of the natures of Christ,142 through which union the union
 of the church is that which it is. But the union of the church is the
 maximum ecclesiastical union. Therefore, since it is maximal, it co
incides on high with the hypostatic union of the natures in Christ. And
 since the union of the natures of Jesus is maximal, it coincides with
 the Absolute Union, which is God. And so, the union of the church,
 which is [a union] of individuals, [coincides] with the [Absolute
 Union].143 Although the union of the church does not seem to be as
 one as is the hypostatic [union], which is [a union] only of the natures,
 or as is the first, divine, most simple [Union], in which there can be
 no otherness or diversity, nevertheless, it is, through Jesus, resolved
 into the Divine Union, from which it also has its origin. And, as
suredly, this [point] is seen quite clearly if attention is paid to what is
 repeatedly found earlier on. For the Absolute Union is the Holy Spir
it. Now, the maximum hypostatic union coincides with the Absolute
 Union. Hence, necessarily, the union of the natures in Christ exists
 through and in the Absolute Union, which is the Holy Spirit. But the
 ecclesiastical union coincides with the hypostatic union, as was said.
150
 De Docta Ignorantia III, 12
 Hence, the union of the triumphant is in the spirit of Jesus, which spir
it is in the Holy Spirit. Truth itself makes such a statement in John:
 “I have given them the glory which You have given me, in order that
 they may be one, as we also are one, I in them and You in me, so that
 they may be perfected in oneness”144—so that the church may be so
 perfect in eternal rest that it could not be more perfect and may exist
 in so inexpressible a transformation of the light of glory that in all [the
 triumphant] only God appears.
 With very great affection we triumphantly aspire to this [glory].
 And with humble heart we entreat God the Father that because of His
 immense graciousness He will to give—through His son, our Lord
 Jesus Christ, and in Him through the Holy Spirit—this [glory] to us
 in order that we may eternally enjoy Him who is blessed forever.

 #### The Author's Letter to Lord Cardinal Julian.
 Receive now, Reverend Father,145 the things which I have long desired
 to attain by various doctrinal-approaches but could not—until, while
 I was at sea en route back from Greece,146 I was led (by, as I believe,
 a heavenly gift from the Father of lights, from whom comes every ex
cellent gift)147 to embrace—in learned ignorance and through a tran
scending of the incorruptible truths which are humanly knowable—in
comprehensible things incomprehensibly.148 Thanks to Him who is
 Truth, I have now expounded this [learned ignorance] in these books,
 which, [since they proceed] from [one and] the same principle, can
 be condensed or expanded.
 But the whole effort of our human intelligence ought to center on
 those lofty [matters], so that the intellect149 may raise itself to that
 Simplicity where contradictories coincide. The conception of Book
 One labors with this [task]. From this [conception] Book Two elicits
 a few [teachings] about the universe—[teachings which go] beyond
 the usual approach of the philosophers and [which will seem] unusu
al to many. Always proceeding from [one and] the same foundation,
 I have now at last completed Book Three, which deals with Superb
lessed Jesus. And through the increase of my faith the Lord Jesus is
 continually magnified in my understanding and affection. For no one
 who has faith in Christ can deny that on this [pilgrim's] pathway he
 would like to be more highly inflamed with desire, so that after long
 meditations and ascensions he would see most sweet Jesus as alone
 to be loved and, abandoning all, would joyously embrace Him as his
 true life and eternal joy. All things work favorably for one who en
ters into Jesus in such a way. And neither this world nor any writings
 can cause [him] any difficulty; for he is transformed into Jesus on ac
count of the spirit of Christ which dwells in him. Christ is the end of
 intellectual desires. May you, Most Devout Father, humbly and con
tinually entreat Him for me, a most wretched sinner, so that we may
 both deserve to enjoy Him eternally.

 20. Cardinal Julian Cesarini. See n. 1 of the notes to Book One.

 23. DI I, 6 (15:6-9).
 24. DI I, 5 (13:7-9). Since the infinite cannot be compared to anything finite, it
 cannot be named by words which have a meaning imposed in relation to finite things.
 Hence, the infinite could not be said to be degree, could not rightly be thought to exist
 as degree. Cf. I, 5 (13:13-16).

 38. DI II, 11 (156:11-18). DP 10-11. Cf. DI III, 6 (220:14-18). With one excep
tion Nicholas does not believe that there is an actually existing contracted maximum
 which reaches the limit of contraction [DI III, 1 (184:1-3)]. The one exception is
 Jesus's humanity, which is so maximum that it is in some sense also minimum [III,
 2-4 (especially 190:15 - 191:14)]. Encompassed in the exception are also Jesus's faith,
 love, and humiliation [III, 11 (249:1-2); III, 12 (254: 16-17); III, 6 (220:14-16)]. See
 n. 23 of the notes to Book One. N. B. The title of DI III, 1 alludes to a maximum
 contracted to a species; it does not allude to the universe.
 39. DI I, 16 (42:4-5; 45:13-18); I, 21 (64:6- 10).
 40. In the corresponding passage of the Latin text (191:9-10) the words “con
tractionis illius” should be taken with “omnem naturam.” Cf. 190:14-15. By “indi
vidual” Nicholas means particular (in contrast to universal, genus, or species). In the

 45. Nicholas does not believe that there is actual1v an infinite line. See Ap. 32:
 10-11; DI II, 1 (97:15-17), and I, 5. He sometimes, as here, uses the future tense to
 express a counterfactual sense.

 47. See 197:9-10 above. Also see n. 36 and n. 77 below. Some of Nicholas's
 statements—e.g., the one above—sound Nestorian. However, they must all be inter
preted in the light of his clear rejection of Nestorianism in III, 7 (223:1-12). The fol
lowing additional texts are noteworthy: III, 4 (204:1-4); III, 7 (225:11-21); 111, 12
 (260:1-4). Jesus is not first a human nature which subsequently ascends (i.e., is sub
sequently united to) the Divine Word. See III, 5 (211:10-18), cited in n. 41 below.

 “non possent” in spite of Klibansky's later having opted to delete “non.” See the list
 of corrigenda (on p. 159 above) for Klibansky's text as found in Book III of De docta

 II, 10 (154:7-9); III, 1 (184: 12-15; 188:1-4); III, 3 (202:16-17). Infinite Power can
not create a thing to be better than it is (i.e., better than it has already been created);
 but Infinite Power can create something still better than that thing.
 55. Cf. 198:5-6 with 199:2-3. Nicholas speaks both of human nature's being el
evated to union with Maximality and of one man's being so elevated (viz., Jesus). In
 both cases he uses the word “homo”. In the above passage “homo” may be translat
ed either as “a human nature” or as “a man”. But the sense of the passage is to be
 understood in accordance with the considerations and references presented in n. 28
 above and n. 41 below.
 Cf. the various nuances of DI III, 3 (202:12); III, 4 (204:2-3, 9, 21-22). Note
 that the phrase “maximus homo” has a different connotation in 204:22 from its con
notation in 208: 10-11. Other medieval writers use “homo” in the same fluctuating
 way. E. g., see Anselm of Canterbury, De Conceptu Virginali et de Originali Pecca
to, opening paragraph of chapter I (Schmitt, ed., Vol. 2, p. 140, lines 3-7). Anselm,
 unlike Nicholas, attempts some clarification in De Incarnatione Verbi 11.
 56. “Operatio,” as used by Nicholas, sometimes means activity and sometimes
 the product of an activity. Here (202:4) “operatio” is best translated by “work,” even
 though at III, 5 (211:16) and elsewhere it is better translated by “operation” or “ac
tivity.” Nicholas uses “opus” and “operatio” interchangeably at III, 3 (201:910).
 57. In the corresponding line of the Latin text (202:9) I am reading “ut sunt, ab
 ipso” in place of “ut sunt ab ipso”.
 58. I.e., is personally united with the Son of God, who is Equality of Being. Cf.
 I, 8 (22: 10) with I, 9 (26:13).
 59. In the corresponding line of the Latin text (202:14) I follow p in reading “ut
 sic” instead of “ut sit”.

 Notes to Book Three
 60. Col. 1: 15 refers to the Son of God as “the Firstborn of all creation.”
 Nicholas, as the next sentence testifies, uses this epithet with regard to Jesus, who is
 God and man. (See also the opening sentences of III, 4.) Though the Son of God pre
ceded ontologically His own created and assumed humanity, He did not precede it
 temporally—any more than He preceded the world temporally. Jesus enters into time
 through the virgin birth, Nicholas teaches (III, 5); but He existed “with God above
 time and prior to all [other] things”—prior in the order of perfection. By way of fur
ther explication Nicholas writes, in III, 5 (211:10-18): “As a sound [is formed] from
 inbreathed air, so, as it were, this Spirit [viz., the Holy Spirit], through an outbreath
ing, formed from the fertile purity of the virginal blood the animal body. He added
 reason so that it would be a human nature. [To it] He so inwardly united the Word
 of God the Father that the Word would be human nature's center of existence. And
 all these things were done not serially (as a concept is temporally expressed by us)
 but by an instantaneous operation—beyond all time and in accordance with a willing
 that befits Infinite Power.” Nicholas is motivated by Col. 1: 17, which states that the
 Firstborn of all creation is prior to all things. (See the lengthy citation, in III, 4, of
 Col. 1: 14-20.) He apparently believes that a created, maximal humanity exists in
 God the Son in such way that (1) it takes precedence over all other created things
 and that (2) they may be said to go forth into contracted being by its mediation. In
 III, 7 he teaches that Jesus's humanity “was corruptible according to temporality, to
 which it was contracted; but in accordance with the fact that it was free from time,
 beyond time, and united with the divinity, it was incorruptible” (225:18-21).

 65. Col. 1: 14-20. This is not an exact quotation. N. B. In Col. 1: 20 the phrase
 “per eum” (cf. 203:33 above) suggests a switch of reference. The Douay version has:
 “Because in him, it hath well pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell: And
 through him to reconcile all things unto himself.” (italics added). The Douay version
 also prefers, for Col. 1: 17, the translation “… by him all things consist.”

 the Son—of the human nature and the divine nature.

 75. “Reason” here means rational soul. In Sermon 17, “Gloria in Excelsis Deo,”
 (Heidelberg Academy Opera Omnia, Vol. 16, fascicle 3) section 4 Nicholas indicates
 explicitly that Jesus was made from a rational soul and human flesh. He thus follows
 the Symbolum Quicumque.
 76. In maintaining that Jesus's rational soul was formed even from the moment
157
 Notes to Book Three
 of conception, Nicholas distinguishes the birth of Jesus from the birth of all other in
fants, who were usually thought to receive their souls at some unspecifiable point be
tween conception and birth. For example, Anselm of Canterbury states in De Con
ceptu Virginali et de Originali Peccato 7: “But no human intellect accepts the view
 that an infant has a rational soul from the moment of his conception. For [from this
 view] it would follow that whenever—even at the very moment of reception—the
 human seed which was received perished before attaining a human form, the [alleged]
 human soul in this seed would be condemned, since it would not be reconciled
 through Christ—a consequence which is utterly absurd.”
