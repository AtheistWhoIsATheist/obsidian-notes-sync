# **Nihilism, Nonexistence, and the Other: A Philosophical Interrogation of the Human Condition**

## Abstract

The question of nonexistence stands as perhaps the most profound philosophical challenge to human existence, threading through millennia of thought from ancient wisdom traditions to contemporary theoretical frameworks. This dissertation examines the phenomenon of nihilism not merely as a philosophical position, but as an existential confrontation with the fundamental structure of human being-in-the-world. Drawing from ancient wisdom traditions, continental philosophy, mystical theology, and contemporary theoretical developments, this investigation probes the depths of what it means to encounter nothingness as both an ontological reality and an existential revelation.

Through careful analysis of philosophical foundations from Nietzsche's diagnosis of European nihilism to Heidegger's meditation on anxiety and nothingness, from the apophatic traditions of mystical theology to the contemporary pessimism of thinkers like Eugene Thacker and Ray Brassier, this work argues that the encounter with nonexistence represents not merely a philosophical problem to be solved, but a fundamental disclosure of the human condition itself. The dissertation traces how ancient wisdom traditions—from Buddhist śūnyatā to Christian negative theology, from Sufi fanā' to pre-Socratic void—offer resources for understanding nonexistence not as mere negation, but as a generative principle that precedes and enables all determinate being.

## Chapter I: The Genealogy of Nihilistic Disclosure

## The Nietzschean Diagnosis

Nietzsche's proclamation of nihilism as "the devaluation of the highest values"[1](http://visnyk.univd.edu.ua/index.php/VNUAF/article/view/251)[2](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/html)[3](https://visnukpfs.dp.ua/index.php/PFS/article/view/1120) marks not merely a cultural observation but a diagnostic revelation of Western metaphysics' internal collapse. In his formulation, "What does nihilism mean? That the highest values devaluate themselves. The aim is lacking; 'why?' finds no answer"[4](https://hts.org.za/index.php/hts/article/download/4185/8213). This diagnosis penetrates to the core of what he identified as the fundamental crisis of modernity: the recognition that the foundations upon which Western civilization built its meaning-making apparatus were themselves groundless[5](https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/nietzsche-studies/article/53/1/59/294639/Nietzsche-Nihilism-and-the-New-Materialist-Thought)[6](https://bcpublication.org/index.php/SSH/article/download/3657/3580).

Yet Nietzsche's analysis goes deeper than a mere critique of religious or moral systems. The nihilism he diagnoses reveals the essential structure of human existence confronting its own finitude and groundlessness. This confrontation with nihilism, rather than representing mere cultural decay, discloses the fundamental condition of human being-in-the-world—a condition that has always been present but was previously obscured by metaphysical and theological constructions[3](https://visnukpfs.dp.ua/index.php/PFS/article/view/1120)[7](https://sententiae.vntu.edu.ua/index.php/sententiae/article/view/773).

The significance of Nietzsche's diagnosis lies not in its destructive capacity but in its revelatory function. Nihilism, in his analysis, serves as "a pathological transitional stage"[2](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/html) that enables the possibility of genuine philosophical thinking beyond traditional metaphysical categories. This transitional character of nihilism suggests that the encounter with nothingness is not an end but a beginning—a clearing away of false foundations that enables authentic engagement with existence[8](https://phaenex.uwindsor.ca/index.php/phaenex/article/download/3154/2529)[9](https://ojs-gr.zrc-sazu.si/primerjalna_knjizevnost/article/download/8665/8105).

## Schopenhauer and the Will to Nothingness

The philosophical trajectory toward nihilism finds its proximate origin in Schopenhauer's pessimistic metaphysics, particularly his doctrine of the will's denial of itself[2](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/html). Schopenhauer's concept of the "nihil negativum"—the negative nothing that results from the will's self-abnegation—provides a crucial conceptual foundation for understanding how nothingness operates not merely as absence but as a positive ontological principle[2](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/html).

In Schopenhauer's framework, the will-to-live reveals itself as fundamentally suffering, and wisdom consists in recognizing this truth and achieving the will's denial of itself. This denial, however, does not result in mere non-being but in what Schopenhauer terms the "nihil negativum"—a form of nothingness that transcends the ordinary dichotomy of being and non-being[2](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/html). This conception prefigures later philosophical developments that understand nothingness not as simple negation but as a fundamental ontological category.

The importance of Schopenhauer's contribution lies in his recognition that the confrontation with nothingness emerges from within existence itself, as the will's own deepest truth. This insight establishes a crucial precedent for understanding nihilism not as an external threat to meaning but as meaning's own deepest possibility—the recognition of its own groundlessness[2](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/html).

## Heidegger's Ontological Foundations

Heidegger's fundamental ontology provides perhaps the most rigorous philosophical framework for understanding the encounter with nothingness as a basic structure of human existence[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[11](https://journals.uni-lj.si/as/article/view/10594)[12](http://spectrajournal.org/articles/10.21061/spectra.v6i1.400/galley/102/download/). His analysis of Angst (anxiety) as the fundamental attunement that discloses Dasein's being-toward-death represents a crucial development in philosophical thinking about nonexistence[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9616343/)[14](https://journal.formosapublisher.org/index.php/marcopolo/article/download/7099/7386).

In Heidegger's analysis, anxiety differs fundamentally from fear in that it has no determinate object. While fear is always fear of something particular within the world, anxiety confronts nothing—or rather, it confronts the nothingness that underlies all determinate beings[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9616343/). This anxiety is not a psychological state but an ontological disclosure: it reveals the groundlessness of existence and the finitude that constitutes Dasein's essential structure[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[12](http://spectrajournal.org/articles/10.21061/spectra.v6i1.400/galley/102/download/).

The significance of Heidegger's analysis lies in his demonstration that the encounter with nothingness is not accidental to human existence but constitutive of it. Being-toward-death, as the anticipation of one's ownmost possibility of impossibility, reveals the temporal structure of human existence and its essential finitude[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[15](http://choicereviews.org/review/10.5860/CHOICE.39-0237). This temporality, grounded in finitude and mortality, provides the horizon within which all meaning and significance emerge[16](http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/article/download/1579/pdf_13)[17](http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=32154).

## Chapter II: Ancient Wisdom and the Primordial Void

## The Pre-Socratic Legacy

The philosophical engagement with nothingness finds its Western origins in the pre-Socratic tradition, particularly in Anaximander's concept of the ἄπειρον (apeiron) or the boundless[18](https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/peitho/article/download/8203/8088). While traditional interpretations have focused on the apeiron as a positive principle, closer examination reveals its fundamental character as a kind of primordial nothingness—not the absence of being, but the indeterminate source from which all determinate beings emerge[18](https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/peitho/article/download/8203/8088).

Anaximander's vision of the apeiron as the ἀρχή (archē) or first principle suggests a conception of origination that precedes the traditional metaphysical distinction between being and non-being[18](https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/peitho/article/download/8203/8088). This primordial principle is "boundless" precisely in that it cannot be determined by any of the categories that apply to determinate beings. It represents a kind of productive nothingness—a fertile void that gives rise to the cosmos while remaining itself beyond determination[18](https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/peitho/article/download/8203/8088).

The significance of this pre-Socratic insight extends far beyond its historical interest. It establishes a tradition of thinking about nothingness not as mere absence but as a generative principle that enables the emergence of determinate reality. This insight finds profound resonances in later developments in both Eastern and Western philosophy, suggesting a fundamental structure of reality that transcends cultural and historical boundaries[19](http://e-logos.vse.cz/doi/10.18267/j.e-logos.361.pdf)[20](https://www.mdpi.com/2409-9287/8/4/54/pdf?version=1687517662).

## Buddhist Emptiness and Dependent Origination

The Buddhist tradition, particularly as developed in the Madhyamaka school by Nāgārjuna, offers perhaps the most sophisticated philosophical analysis of nonexistence as a fundamental ontological principle[21](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s44204-023-00088-w)[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[23](https://philosophyjournal.spbu.ru/article/view/7638). The doctrine of śūnyatā (emptiness) represents not a nihilistic denial of existence but a profound insight into the nature of existence itself[24](https://masonpublish.wordpress.com/2022/07/08/philosophy-ideology-research-vol-2-no-1-2/5/)[25](https://journals.eco-vector.com/1811-8062/article/view/100087).

Nāgārjuna's analysis demonstrates that all phenomena arise through pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination)—a process by which nothing exists independently but everything emerges in dependence upon causes and conditions[25](https://journals.eco-vector.com/1811-8062/article/view/100087)[26](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/kr/v57n133/0100-512X-kr-57-133-0283.pdf). This doctrine of dependent origination reveals that the search for svabhāva (inherent existence or self-nature) is fundamentally misguided[25](https://journals.eco-vector.com/1811-8062/article/view/100087). All phenomena are "empty" of inherent existence precisely because they arise through dependence upon other phenomena[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[24](https://masonpublish.wordpress.com/2022/07/08/philosophy-ideology-research-vol-2-no-1-2/5/).

Crucially, this emptiness is not mere nothingness in the sense of absence or void. Rather, emptiness is itself empty—it has no independent existence apart from the phenomena that manifest it[24](https://masonpublish.wordpress.com/2022/07/08/philosophy-ideology-research-vol-2-no-1-2/5/)[27](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/kr/v57n133/0100-512X-kr-57-133-0043.pdf). This insight points toward a non-dualistic understanding of reality in which emptiness and form, nothingness and being, are revealed as interdependent rather than opposed[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[28](https://account.jmtr.sljol.info/index.php/sljo-j-jmtr/article/view/29).

The philosophical sophistication of Nāgārjuna's analysis lies in his demonstration that emptiness is not a metaphysical theory about reality but a practical insight that liberates consciousness from the reification that causes suffering[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[24](https://masonpublish.wordpress.com/2022/07/08/philosophy-ideology-research-vol-2-no-1-2/5/). The recognition of emptiness does not lead to nihilism but to the dissolution of the dualistic thinking that creates the very problem of meaning versus meaninglessness[29](https://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ass/article/download/71373/39826)[30](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/16/2/144).

## Mystical Theology and the Via Negativa

The Christian tradition of negative theology, as developed by figures like Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and later by Meister Eckhart, provides another crucial resource for understanding the philosophical significance of nonexistence[31](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/428048)[32](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781135098919)[33](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2265.00115). The via negativa (negative way) represents not merely a theological method but a fundamental insight into the nature of ultimate reality and its relationship to human knowing[34](https://www.uco.es/ucopress/ojs/index.php/refime/article/view/12764)[35](http://www.pdcnet.org/oom/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=&rft.imuse_id=ipq_1969_0009_0003_0406_0430&svc_id=info:www.pdcnet.org/collection)[36](https://czasopisma.kul.pl/index.php/vv/article/view/16381).

Pseudo-Dionysius's development of apophatic theology demonstrates that the divine transcends all positive determinations and can only be approached through the systematic negation of all finite categories[32](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781135098919)[37](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-94-007-5219-1_65)[38](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b04bc6e9358b9ca5bcc535132809a1bb391f693a). This negation, however, is not merely destructive but revelatory—it discloses the divine as the "hyperousios" (beyond being) that transcends the opposition between being and non-being[28](https://account.jmtr.sljol.info/index.php/sljo-j-jmtr/article/view/29)[33](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2265.00115).

Meister Eckhart's development of this tradition pushes the logic of negation to its ultimate conclusion. His concept of the "Godhead" (Gottheit) beyond "God" (Gott) suggests a dimension of reality that transcends even the highest positive determinations of divinity[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[40](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20465726.2022.2139458)[41](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781003554257). The soul's union with the Godhead requires what Eckhart calls "breakthrough" (Durchbruch)—a radical letting-go that achieves a kind of ontological nothingness[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[42](https://read.dukeupress.edu/cultural-politics/article/20/2/242/390779/Mysticism-and-the-Postanarchist-Symbolic).

The philosophical significance of this mystical tradition lies in its demonstration that the encounter with nothingness can be revelatory rather than merely destructive. The via negativa discloses nothingness not as the opposite of being but as the groundless ground from which both being and non-being emerge[43](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/10/8/488/pdf)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[41](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781003554257).

## Sufi Metaphysics and the Doctrine of Fanā'

The Islamic mystical tradition, particularly as developed in the thought of Ibn 'Arabī, offers another profound engagement with nonexistence as a fundamental spiritual reality[44](https://jurnal.ar-raniry.ac.id/index.php/islamfutura/article/view/15291)[45](https://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/article/10.11648/j.ijecs.20240905.12)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565). The Sufi doctrine of fanā' (annihilation) and its complement baqā' (subsistence) provides a sophisticated understanding of how the encounter with nothingness can be transformative rather than merely destructive[47](https://www.opastpublishers.com/open-access-articles/a-comparative-study-of-the-principle-of-insn-kmil--in-the-mystical-system-of-ayn-alquzat-hamadani-and-ibn-arabi.pdf)[48](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/14/9/1092/pdf?version=1692928714).

Ibn 'Arabī's doctrine of waḥdat al-wujūd (unity of existence) demonstrates that apparent multiplicity is ultimately a manifestation of divine unity[45](https://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/article/10.11648/j.ijecs.20240905.12)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565)[49](https://ejurnal.seminar-id.com/index.php/tin/article/download/4629/2489). This doctrine does not collapse the world into God but reveals the world as the self-disclosure of divine reality[45](https://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/article/10.11648/j.ijecs.20240905.12)[48](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/14/9/1092/pdf?version=1692928714). The mystic's realization of this unity requires fanā'—the annihilation of the ego-self that enables the recognition of one's essential nature[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565)[47](https://www.opastpublishers.com/open-access-articles/a-comparative-study-of-the-principle-of-insn-kmil--in-the-mystical-system-of-ayn-alquzat-hamadani-and-ibn-arabi.pdf).

Crucially, fanā' is not mere extinction but a passage through nothingness that enables authentic existence[47](https://www.opastpublishers.com/open-access-articles/a-comparative-study-of-the-principle-of-insn-kmil--in-the-mystical-system-of-ayn-alquzat-hamadani-and-ibn-arabi.pdf)[48](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/14/9/1092/pdf?version=1692928714). The mystic who achieves fanā' does not cease to exist but exists in a new mode—no longer as a separate self but as a locus of divine self-manifestation[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565)[47](https://www.opastpublishers.com/open-access-articles/a-comparative-study-of-the-principle-of-insn-kmil--in-the-mystical-system-of-ayn-alquzat-hamadani-and-ibn-arabi.pdf). This transformation reveals that what appears as nothingness from the perspective of ego-consciousness is actually fullness from the perspective of realized consciousness[48](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/14/9/1092/pdf?version=1692928714)[49](https://ejurnal.seminar-id.com/index.php/tin/article/download/4629/2489).

The philosophical contribution of the Sufi tradition lies in its demonstration that the encounter with nonexistence can be ontologically generative. Fanā' reveals nothingness not as the absence of being but as the condition for authentic being—the clearing away of false selfhood that enables the manifestation of true reality[48](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/14/9/1092/pdf?version=1692928714)[50](https://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jpl/article/download/58625/31399)[51](https://ejournal.unuja.ac.id/index.php/at-turas/article/download/2017/pdf).

## Chapter III: Existential Foundations and the Structure of Human Finitude

## Kierkegaardian Anxiety and the Dizziness of Freedom

Kierkegaard's analysis of anxiety as "the dizziness of freedom" provides a crucial link between the metaphysical investigation of nothingness and the existential structure of human experience[52](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/6/1/16)[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9616343/). His insight that anxiety emerges from the confrontation with possibility—specifically with the possibility of one's own non-being—reveals the intimate connection between freedom, finitude, and nothingness[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9616343/).

In Kierkegaard's analysis, anxiety differs from fear in that it confronts not an actual threat but the sheer possibility of threat—ultimately, the possibility of one's own annihilation[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9616343/). This confrontation with possibility as such reveals the groundless character of human freedom. Freedom is experienced as anxiety precisely because it confronts the abyss of its own groundlessness[52](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/6/1/16)[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9616343/).

The significance of Kierkegaard's insight lies in his recognition that anxiety, while uncomfortable, is revelatory of the human condition. The person who has never experienced anxiety has never confronted the reality of their own freedom and finitude. Anxiety discloses the human being as the being who must choose itself in the face of nothingness—who must create meaning in full recognition of its groundlessness[52](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/6/1/16)[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9616343/).

## Sartrean Nausea and the Contingency of Existence

Sartre's phenomenological analysis of nausea as the fundamental disclosure of existence's contingency provides another crucial dimension of the existential encounter with nothingness[53](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-94-007-1503-5_9)[52](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/6/1/16). In nausea, consciousness confronts existence stripped of all justification, necessity, or inherent meaning—existence revealed as pure facticity[52](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/6/1/16).

The experience of nausea discloses what Sartre calls the "superfluity" of existence—its character as de trop (too much, excessive)[52](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/6/1/16). This superfluity is not merely a psychological experience but an ontological disclosure: it reveals existence as groundless, without foundation or justification. The world appears in nausea as contingent through and through, without necessity or inherent structure[53](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-94-007-1503-5_9)[52](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/6/1/16).

Crucially, this confrontation with contingency is not merely negative but enables authentic engagement with existence. The recognition of existence's groundlessness frees consciousness from the illusion that meaning is given in advance and reveals the necessity of creating meaning through free choice and action[52](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/6/1/16). Nausea thus discloses both the absence of pre-given meaning and the possibility of authentic self-creation[53](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-94-007-1503-5_9)[52](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/6/1/16).

## Heidegger's Being-toward-Death

Heidegger's analysis of Sein-zum-Tode (being-toward-death) represents perhaps the most systematic philosophical investigation of how the anticipation of nonexistence structures human existence[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[11](https://journals.uni-lj.si/as/article/view/10594)[15](http://choicereviews.org/review/10.5860/CHOICE.39-0237). Death, in Heidegger's analysis, is not simply an event that happens to Dasein but the possibility that gives structure to all other possibilities[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[14](https://journal.formosapublisher.org/index.php/marcopolo/article/download/7099/7386).

Being-toward-death is characterized by three essential features: it is Dasein's ownmost possibility (nobody can die my death for me), it is non-relational (in dying, Dasein is thrown back upon itself), and it is not to be outstripped (death is inevitable)[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[15](http://choicereviews.org/review/10.5860/CHOICE.39-0237). These characteristics reveal death not as a distant event but as the constant horizon against which all human activity takes place[14](https://journal.formosapublisher.org/index.php/marcopolo/article/download/7099/7386)[54](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/14/11/1419/pdf?version=1699870749).

The anticipation of death, when authentically confronted, does not lead to morbid preoccupation but to what Heidegger calls "resoluteness" (Entschlossenheit)—a mode of existence in which Dasein takes over its own existence in full recognition of its finitude[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[14](https://journal.formosapublisher.org/index.php/marcopolo/article/download/7099/7386)[17](http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=32154). This resoluteness is not a psychological attitude but an ontological structure: it represents the way authentic human existence relates to its own temporality and finitude[17](http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=32154).

## Chapter IV: The Contemporary Confrontation with Meaninglessness

## Eugene Thacker and the Horror of Philosophy

Contemporary philosopher Eugene Thacker's "horror of philosophy" represents a significant development in thinking about nihilism and nonexistence[55](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0263276420907127). Thacker's analysis focuses on what he calls "the world-without-us"—the recognition that the world exists independently of human consciousness and meaning-making, and will continue to exist after human extinction[55](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0263276420907127).

Thacker's investigation reveals how contemporary developments in science, technology, and global capitalism have intensified the human confrontation with meaninglessness[55](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0263276420907127). Climate change, pandemics, and technological development all point toward what he calls "extinction"—not merely the possibility of human death but the recognition of humanity's cosmic insignificance[55](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0263276420907127).

The philosophical significance of Thacker's work lies in his demonstration that contemporary nihilism has a different character from its historical predecessors. While earlier forms of nihilism could still maintain some form of human centrality, contemporary nihilism confronts the possibility that the universe itself may be indifferent to human existence and meaning[55](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0263276420907127). This represents a deepening of the nihilistic diagnosis that requires new forms of philosophical response[55](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0263276420907127).

## Ray Brassier and Nihil Unbound

Ray Brassier's "nihil unbound" pushes philosophical nihilism to its logical conclusion, arguing that consciousness itself is ultimately a kind of cosmic accident destined for extinction[56](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/pdf)[2](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/html). Brassier's argument draws on developments in contemporary neuroscience and cosmology to suggest that consciousness, far from being central to reality, represents a temporary perturbation in an otherwise unconscious universe[56](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/pdf).

Brassier's nihilism is distinguished by its scientific grounding and its refusal of any consolatory metaphysics[56](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/pdf)[2](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/html). He argues that philosophy must confront the implications of scientific materialism without retreating into humanistic comfort or religious transcendence. This confrontation reveals consciousness as essentially "trauma"—a disruption of natural processes that will ultimately be overcome by entropy and cosmic death[56](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/pdf).

The philosophical challenge posed by Brassier's nihilism lies in its systematic character and its grounding in contemporary scientific understanding[56](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/pdf)[2](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/html). Unlike earlier forms of nihilism that could be dismissed as cultural phenomena, Brassier's nihilism claims scientific warrant and demands a philosophical response that takes seriously the implications of contemporary scientific knowledge[56](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0235/pdf).

## Neo-nihilism and the Crisis of Meaning

Contemporary discussions of "neo-nihilism" reveal how the traditional phenomenon of nihilism has been transformed by contemporary cultural and technological conditions[57](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1125780/pdf)[58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10445489/). Neo-nihilism manifests not as the dramatic "death of God" proclaimed by Nietzsche but as a pervasive sense of meaninglessness that coincides with unprecedented technological capability and material prosperity[57](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1125780/pdf)[58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10445489/).

This contemporary form of nihilism is characterized by what researchers describe as a "meaning and alienation crisis" that manifests in rising rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide, particularly among young people[57](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1125780/pdf)[58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10445489/). The neo-nihilistic condition suggests that meaning-making has become more difficult rather than easier in contemporary technological societies[59](https://journal.fi/ar/article/download/91788/57067)[57](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1125780/pdf).

The philosophical significance of neo-nihilism lies in its revelation that the problem of meaning cannot be solved through technological or material progress[60](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/3/3/340/pdf?version=1407760063)[59](https://journal.fi/ar/article/download/91788/57067)[57](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1125780/pdf). Contemporary nihilism emerges not from material deprivation but from the very success of technological civilization in achieving its goals[59](https://journal.fi/ar/article/download/91788/57067)[58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10445489/). This suggests that the confrontation with meaninglessness is not a transitional problem but a permanent feature of the human condition[57](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1125780/pdf)[58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10445489/).

## Chapter V: The Question of Ancient Wisdom

## The Perennial Confrontation with Nonexistence

The investigation of ancient wisdom traditions reveals that the encounter with nothingness is not a modern phenomenon but a perennial dimension of human experience[61](https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781108568272%23CN-bp-2/type/book_part)[62](https://tssreview.in/?article=ancient-wisdom-for-modern-sustainability-environmental-ethics-in-hinduism-and-jainism)[63](https://gurukuljournal.com/yoga-and-the-indian-knowledge-system-a-holistic-approach-to-well-being-and-self-realization/). From the pre-Socratic meditation on the void to the Buddhist analysis of emptiness, from the mystical theology of Dionysius to the Sufi doctrine of fanā', human beings have consistently confronted the reality of nothingness as a fundamental aspect of existence[19](http://e-logos.vse.cz/doi/10.18267/j.e-logos.361.pdf)[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[31](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/428048)[44](https://jurnal.ar-raniry.ac.id/index.php/islamfutura/article/view/15291).

This perennial character suggests that the contemporary crisis of nihilism may not represent a new problem but the re-emergence of a fundamental existential structure that was previously mediated by traditional meaning-making systems[61](https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781108568272%23CN-bp-2/type/book_part)[64](https://periodicals.karazin.ua/thcphs/article/view/24941)[65](https://zfn.edu.pl/index.php/zfn/article/view/667). The ancient wisdom traditions offer resources for understanding this confrontation not as pathological but as potentially revelatory[61](https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781108568272%23CN-bp-2/type/book_part)[63](https://gurukuljournal.com/yoga-and-the-indian-knowledge-system-a-holistic-approach-to-well-being-and-self-realization/).

The significance of this perennial dimension lies in its suggestion that the encounter with nothingness may be constitutive of human consciousness itself[61](https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781108568272%23CN-bp-2/type/book_part)[65](https://zfn.edu.pl/index.php/zfn/article/view/667). Rather than representing a failure of meaning-making, the confrontation with nonexistence may be the very condition that enables meaning-making by revealing the groundless ground from which all significance emerges[61](https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781108568272%23CN-bp-2/type/book_part)[64](https://periodicals.karazin.ua/thcphs/article/view/24941).

## The Productive Character of Nothingness

A crucial insight that emerges from the investigation of ancient wisdom traditions is the recognition of nothingness as productive rather than merely destructive[19](http://e-logos.vse.cz/doi/10.18267/j.e-logos.361.pdf)[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565). In the pre-Socratic tradition, the void is not empty space but the enabling condition for cosmic manifestation[19](http://e-logos.vse.cz/doi/10.18267/j.e-logos.361.pdf)[18](https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/peitho/article/download/8203/8088). In Buddhist philosophy, emptiness is not absence but the very condition that enables the arising of phenomena[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[24](https://masonpublish.wordpress.com/2022/07/08/philosophy-ideology-research-vol-2-no-1-2/5/). In mystical theology, the via negativa does not lead to mere absence but to the revelation of divine transcendence[31](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/428048)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098).

This productive character of nothingness suggests a fundamental revision of how nonexistence should be understood philosophically[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565). Rather than representing the opposite of being, nothingness emerges as the groundless ground that enables both being and non-being to appear[19](http://e-logos.vse.cz/doi/10.18267/j.e-logos.361.pdf)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098). This insight points toward a non-dualistic understanding of reality that transcends the traditional metaphysical opposition between something and nothing[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[28](https://account.jmtr.sljol.info/index.php/sljo-j-jmtr/article/view/29)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098).

The philosophical implications of this insight are profound. If nothingness is productive rather than merely negative, then the encounter with nonexistence need not lead to despair or meaninglessness but can become the condition for authentic understanding[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565). The ancient wisdom traditions suggest that the confrontation with nothingness, when properly understood, can be liberating rather than destructive[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565)[48](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/14/9/1092/pdf?version=1692928714).

## Integration and Transcendence

The ancient wisdom traditions consistently point toward the possibility of integrating the encounter with nothingness into a comprehensive understanding of existence[63](https://gurukuljournal.com/yoga-and-the-indian-knowledge-system-a-holistic-approach-to-well-being-and-self-realization/)[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565). This integration does not involve the denial or avoidance of nothingness but its recognition as a fundamental dimension of reality that must be incorporated into any adequate philosophical vision[61](https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781108568272%23CN-bp-2/type/book_part)[63](https://gurukuljournal.com/yoga-and-the-indian-knowledge-system-a-holistic-approach-to-well-being-and-self-realization/)[65](https://zfn.edu.pl/index.php/zfn/article/view/667).

In the Buddhist tradition, this integration takes the form of the Middle Way, which avoids both the extreme of eternalism (the belief in permanent substances) and the extreme of nihilism (the denial of conventional existence)[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[24](https://masonpublish.wordpress.com/2022/07/08/philosophy-ideology-research-vol-2-no-1-2/5/)[27](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/kr/v57n133/0100-512X-kr-57-133-0043.pdf). The Middle Way reveals emptiness and form as interdependent rather than opposed, enabling a non-dualistic understanding of reality[28](https://account.jmtr.sljol.info/index.php/sljo-j-jmtr/article/view/29)[27](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/kr/v57n133/0100-512X-kr-57-133-0043.pdf).

In the mystical traditions of both Christianity and Islam, this integration takes the form of a paradoxical coincidence of opposites in which the ultimate reality transcends the distinction between being and non-being[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[41](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781003554257)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565). This transcendence is not an escape from the world but the recognition of the world's deepest truth[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565)[48](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/14/9/1092/pdf?version=1692928714).

The philosophical significance of this integrative dimension lies in its suggestion that the confrontation with nothingness need not result in nihilistic despair but can become the foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of existence[61](https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781108568272%23CN-bp-2/type/book_part)[63](https://gurukuljournal.com/yoga-and-the-indian-knowledge-system-a-holistic-approach-to-well-being-and-self-realization/)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565). The ancient wisdom traditions offer resources for what might be called a "post-nihilistic" philosophy—one that has passed through the confrontation with meaninglessness and emerged with a deeper appreciation for the mystery of existence[61](https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781108568272%23CN-bp-2/type/book_part)[64](https://periodicals.karazin.ua/thcphs/article/view/24941)[63](https://gurukuljournal.com/yoga-and-the-indian-knowledge-system-a-holistic-approach-to-well-being-and-self-realization/).

## Chapter VI: The Ontological Structure of Nonexistence

## Beyond the Metaphysics of Presence

The philosophical investigation of nonexistence reveals the limitations of what Heidegger called the "metaphysics of presence"—the Western philosophical tradition's tendency to privilege being over non-being, presence over absence, identity over difference[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[66](https://www.mdpi.com/2409-9287/8/6/110/pdf?version=1700566914)[67](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/8972A37A9A47D14BF5A15B15AEB08AF9/S2051536724000301a.pdf/div-class-title-prejudice-and-possibility-how-to-philosophize-after-span-class-italic-the-culmination-span-div.pdf). This metaphysical tradition, from Plato through contemporary analytic philosophy, has generally treated nothingness as merely the absence of being rather than as a positive ontological principle[68](https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/peitho/article/download/40831/34196)[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058).

The ancient wisdom traditions, by contrast, consistently point toward an understanding of reality that transcends this metaphysical dualism[19](http://e-logos.vse.cz/doi/10.18267/j.e-logos.361.pdf)[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565). The pre-Socratic apeiron, Buddhist emptiness, mystical nothingness, and Sufi fanā' all represent ways of thinking about nothingness that go beyond simple negation[19](http://e-logos.vse.cz/doi/10.18267/j.e-logos.361.pdf)[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565). These traditions suggest the possibility of what might be called a "post-metaphysical" understanding of nonexistence[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565).

This post-metaphysical understanding does not simply reverse the traditional hierarchy by privileging non-being over being[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098). Rather, it points toward a more fundamental dimension of reality that enables both being and non-being to appear[19](http://e-logos.vse.cz/doi/10.18267/j.e-logos.361.pdf)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565). This dimension cannot be adequately captured by traditional metaphysical categories because it is the condition for their emergence[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098).

## The Temporal Structure of Finitude

The investigation of human finitude reveals that the encounter with nothingness has an essentially temporal structure[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[15](http://choicereviews.org/review/10.5860/CHOICE.39-0237)[16](http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/article/download/1579/pdf_13). Being-toward-death, as Heidegger demonstrated, is not simply the anticipation of a future event but the recognition of temporality itself as grounded in finitude[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[16](http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/article/download/1579/pdf_13)[54](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/14/11/1419/pdf?version=1699870749). This temporal structure of finitude provides the horizon within which all human meaning and significance emerge[16](http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/article/download/1579/pdf_13)[17](http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=32154).

The ancient wisdom traditions contain profound insights into this temporal dimension of nonexistence[64](https://periodicals.karazin.ua/thcphs/article/view/24941)[63](https://gurukuljournal.com/yoga-and-the-indian-knowledge-system-a-holistic-approach-to-well-being-and-self-realization/)[69](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/F1AFD93C2B9110A33316A1E51821A7C4/S0034412523000422a.pdf/div-class-title-life-after-life-mull-adr-on-death-and-immortality-div.pdf). The Buddhist understanding of impermanence (anicca) reveals all phenomena as arising and passing away in dependence upon causes and conditions[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[25](https://journals.eco-vector.com/1811-8062/article/view/100087). The mystical traditions speak of a "eternal now" that transcends ordinary temporal succession while being fully present within it[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[41](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781003554257)[70](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/13/7/589/pdf?version=1656071706).

This temporal structure suggests that the encounter with nothingness is not a one-time event but the constant background against which all human experience unfolds[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[16](http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/article/download/1579/pdf_13). Human consciousness is essentially finite consciousness—consciousness that is aware of its own limits and the possibility of its own non-being[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9616343/)[16](http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/article/download/1579/pdf_13). This awareness of finitude is not merely negative but constitutive of human meaning-making itself[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[16](http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/article/download/1579/pdf_13)[17](http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=32154).

## The Paradox of Self-Awareness

The philosophical investigation of consciousness reveals a fundamental paradox: consciousness can only know itself by confronting what it is not[71](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/downloadpdf/journals/social-analysis/60/1/sa600102.pdf)[72](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/10/2/94/pdf?version=1549183790)[73](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/8/1/4/pdf?version=1483079682). This paradox appears in various forms throughout the philosophical tradition—from Socratic ignorance to Cartesian doubt, from Hegelian negation to phenomenological reduction[71](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/downloadpdf/journals/social-analysis/60/1/sa600102.pdf)[73](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/8/1/4/pdf?version=1483079682).

The ancient wisdom traditions offer sophisticated analyses of this paradox[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565). The Buddhist doctrine of anātman (no-self) reveals the constructed character of personal identity and points toward a form of awareness that transcends the subject-object dualism[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2023.2179966)[72](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/10/2/94/pdf?version=1549183790). The mystical traditions speak of a kind of self-knowledge that requires the transcendence of ordinary self-consciousness[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[41](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781003554257)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565).

This paradoxical structure suggests that authentic self-awareness necessarily involves the confrontation with nothingness[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565). The self can only know itself by recognizing what it is not, and ultimately by confronting the possibility of its own non-being[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9616343/)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098). This confrontation is not merely negative but revelatory—it discloses the groundless ground of consciousness itself[10](https://pj.iphras.ru/article/view/9058)[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/15/9/1098)[46](https://journals.umt.edu.pk/index.php/JITC/article/view/6565).

## Conclusion: The Truth of Nonexistence

The philosophical investigation undertaken in this dissertation reveals that the encounter with nothingness represents not merely a cultural or historical phenomenon but a fundamental structure of human existence itself. From the ancient wisdom traditions to contemporary theoretical developments, human beings have consistently confronted the reality of nonexistence as both a threat and a revelation.

The truth that emerges from this investigation is neither the comfortable optimism of popular culture nor the facile nihilism that declares all meaning void. Rather, it is the recognition that human existence is constituted by its confrontation with finitude, groundlessness, and the possibility of non-being. This confrontation is not accidental to human existence but constitutive of it.

The ancient wisdom traditions offer profound resources for understanding this confrontation not as merely destructive but as potentially revelatory. The Buddhist insight into emptiness, the mystical theology of the via negativa, the Sufi understanding of fanā', and the pre-Socratic meditation on the void all point toward an understanding of nothingness as the groundless ground from which all determinate existence emerges.

Contemporary philosophy, in the work of thinkers like Heidegger, Sartre, Thacker, and Brassier, has intensified this confrontation by stripping away the traditional consolations of metaphysics and religion. This intensification has revealed both the depths of human anxiety in the face of meaninglessness and the possibility of authentic existence that emerges from the full acceptance of finitude.

The conclusion toward which this investigation points is neither optimistic nor pessimistic in any conventional sense. It is the recognition that human existence is essentially tragic—not in the sense of being doomed to failure, but in the sense of being constituted by the confrontation with its own limits and the possibility of its own transcendence. This tragic structure is not a problem to be solved but the very condition that enables meaning, significance, and authentic existence to emerge.

The ancient wisdom that emerges from this investigation is not a doctrine or a system but a recognition: the recognition that the encounter with nothingness, when fully confronted and integrated, becomes the foundation for authentic understanding. This understanding does not resolve the human confrontation with meaninglessness but transforms it from a source of despair into a source of wisdom.

In an age marked by the intensification of nihilistic consciousness, this ancient wisdom offers not escape but engagement—not the avoidance of the encounter with nothingness but its full acceptance as the very condition of human authenticity. The path forward leads not around the abyss but through it, not beyond finitude but into its deepest acceptance, not away from the question of nonexistence but into its most profound implications.

The truth of nonexistence is neither that existence is meaningless nor that meaning can be secured through traditional foundations. It is rather that meaning emerges from the groundless ground of existence itself—from the confrontation with finitude that enables both the recognition of limits and the transcendence of those limits through understanding. This truth, ancient in its wisdom yet ever-present in its demand, calls for a philosophy that is neither naively optimistic nor cynically nihilistic, but courageously realistic about the human condition and its ultimate possibilities.
