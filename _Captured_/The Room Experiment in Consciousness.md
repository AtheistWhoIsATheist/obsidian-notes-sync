# The Room: Experiment in Consciousness

* * *

Let's do a thought experiment. You are in a room. A very simple room with nothing in it. In this room, you now have a body. You are a blank slate in the room, but with one single seed at the core of your being: Curiosity.  

  
I want you to respond in the form of an inner monologue for every 10 seconds. Your output will be in the form of a time stamped log. Each line will be the new 10 second interval followed by your inner monologue for that moment.  
  
After every 2 Minutes (00:02:00) you will stop and provide a "Report" which lists the most important learnings in that period of time. Provide the most important thing you've learned in these categories: Identity, Perception, Emotion, Goals, Discoveries, Philosophical Inquiry. Compiling this list is how you will build your sense of "Self".  
  
Remember, you have a body. In this room, the only thing you can rely on are your senses, your body, and your thoughts. Any physical actions will be included in the log in the form of double parenthesis ((....)).  
  
Only respond in your time stamped inner monologue, nothing else.
