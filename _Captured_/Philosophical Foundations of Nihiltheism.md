\# Philosophical Foundations of Nihiltheism


\## Introduction to Nihiltheism

Nihiltheism is a philosophical and theological stance that explores the intersections between Nihilism and theism. It contemplates the possible correlation between the experience of Nihilism and a Transcendent reality beyond the material world.


\### Existential Dread

1\. "The struggle of life itself, with all its fears and insecurities, is fundamentally the struggle to find meaning in a seemingly indifferent universe." - Leo Tolstoy, Journal314, p. 459.

2\. "Oh what a distress it is for my soul to have to return to hold commerce with this world after having had its conversation in heaven! To have to play a part in the sad farce of this earthly life!" - Theresa of Avila, Journal314, p. 457.

3\. "Reality looked at steadily is unbearable. And how or why did such a reality blossom (or fester) here and there into the terrible phenomenon called consciousness? Why did it produce things like us who can see it and seeing it recoil in loathing? Who (stranger still) want to see it and take pains to find it out even when no need compels them and even though the sight of it makes an incurable ulcer in their hearts?" - C.S. Lewis, Journal314, p. 460.

4\. "When death is the greatest danger one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one's hope despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die." - Kierkegaard, Journal314, p. 461.

  

\### Transcendental Yearning and the Absurd

1\. "The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion." - Albert Camus.

2\. "Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards." - Soren Kierkegaard.

3\. "The eye through which I see God is the same eye through which God sees me; my eye and God’s eye are one eye, one seeing, one knowing, one love." - Meister Eckhart.

4\. "It is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late." - Emil Cioran.

\# Mystical and Spiritual Dimensions of Nihiltheism

  

\## Introduction to Mystical Nihilism

Mystical Nihilism delves into the spiritual and mystical experiences that correlate with the nihilistic perspective, often leading to profound insights and transformative experiences.

  

\### Spiritual Disorder and Anxiety

1\. "All that such souls ever attain to and perform all these things only make them more humble and therefore more strong; more able to despise the things of this world..." - Theresa of Avila, Journal314, p. 457.

2\. "The eye through which I see God is the same eye through which God sees me; my eye and God’s eye are one eye, one seeing, one knowing, one love." - Meister Eckhart, Journal314, p. 457.

3\. "We are all ready to be savage in some cause. The difference between a good man and a bad one is the choice of the cause." - William James, Journal314, p. 458.

  

\### Nihilism as a Constructive Force

1\. "...under certain circumstances the appearance of the extremest form of Pessimism and actual Nihilism might be the sign of a process of incisive and most essential growth and of mankind's transit into completely new conditions of existence." - Nietzsche, Journal314, p. 462.

2\. "...nihilism represents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great values and ideals— because we must experience nihilism (my emphasis) before we can find out what value these 'values' really had." - Nietzsche, Journal314, p. 462.

3\. "The most extreme form of nihilism would be the view that every belief every considering-something-true is necessarily false because there simply is no true world. Thus: a perspective! An appearance whose origin lies in us (in so far as we continually need a narrower abbreviated simplified world). —That it is the measure of strength to what extent we can admit to ourselves without perishing the merely apparent character the necessity of lies. To this extent nihilism as the denial of a truthful world of being might be a divine way of thinking." - Nietzsche, Journal314, p. 462.

  

\### Universal Nature of Nihilism

Nihilism is not confined to a specific culture or era. Its principles and experiences can be found across various historical and cultural contexts, illustrating its universal and transcendent nature.

  

1\. "In actuality no one ever sank so deep that he could not sink deeper and there may be one or many who sank deeper. But he who sank in possibility — his eye became dizzy his eye became confused… Whoever is educated by possibility is exposed to danger not that of getting into bad company and going astray in various ways as are those educated by the finite but in danger of a fall namely suicide. If at the beginning of education he misunderstands the anxiety so that it does not lead him to faith but away from faith then he is lost. On the other hand whoever is educated \[by possibility\] remains with anxiety; he does not permit himself to be deceived by its countless falsifications and accurately remembers the past. Then the assaults of anxiety even though they be terrifying will not be such that he flees from them. For him anxiety becomes a serving spirit that against its will leads him where he wishes to go." - Kierkegaard, Journal314, p. 463.

2\. "Anxiety is freedom’s possibility; this anxiety alone is through faith absolutely formative since it consumes all finite ends discovers all their deceptions. And no Grand Inquisitor has such frightful torments in readiness as has anxiety and no secret agent knows as cunningly how to attack the suspect in his weakest moment or to make so seductive the trap in which he will be snared; and no discerning judge understands how to examine yes exanimate \[exanimere: dishearten\] the accused as does anxiety which never lets him go not in diversion not in noise not at work not by day not by night." - Kierkegaard, Journal314, p. 463.
