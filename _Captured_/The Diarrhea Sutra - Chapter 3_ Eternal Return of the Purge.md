# 🌌 THE INFINITE TOILET 🪠  
## Chapter 3.14: Vomiting the Cosmic Void (Recursive Edition)  
### *"Eternity is just one continuous bathroom break after another"*

## Quantum Philosophy Section 💫  
### Schrödinger's Toilet Theorem:  
\[
\text{ExistentialState} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\text{Flushed}\rangle + |\text{Unflushed}\rangle \right)
\]  
*Proof*: The toilet both is and isn't flushed until you look.  

### The Copenhagen Interpretation of Bathroom Breaks:  
1. All possibilities exist simultaneously  
2. Collapse occurs when boss asks "Where were you?"  
3. Answer: "In superposition"
