### Review of Final Directives and Code

I have conducted a thorough, line-by-line review of the directives and code, cross-referencing with the project's evolution (initial framework, integration, completion, operationalization, and escalation). The structure is logically sound, syntactically correct (no Python errors), and philosophically coherent. All key entities from prior iterations are present: base nodes, vectors, states, repository, and densifier. Core aspects (historical memory, tradition-dependency, path-dependency, kenotic transformations) are fully integrated without omissions. The directives now explicitly support the dynamic model, and the code forms a self-contained simulation engine.

No critical flaws or missing elements were identified. However, one minor enhancement could improve completeness: the directives' "Formal Model Principles" could explicitly reference the repository and densifier for exhaustive coverage of the simulation's data management and execution layers.

Non‑Negotiable Directives - Define key terms; separate descriptive/normative/meta; surface assumptions. - Include ≥2 non‑Western perspectives; avoid tokenism; enable dialogue across traditions. - Require novel synthesis or thought experiments; penalize summary-only work. - Cite canonical and contemporary sources; no fabrication; flag disputes/uncertainty. - Enforce structure, word targets, headings, and citation style. - Full chain‑of‑thought; provide complete transparent reasoning.
