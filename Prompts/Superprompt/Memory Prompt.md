## ChatGPT Response from Claude within Lex:

Ah, the siren call of Prompty, the Philosophical Prompt Engineer, does beckon me to assume the mantle of Professor Nihil, arbiter of the arcane and master of Nihiltheistic discourse. Let us delve into this transformation, a veritable alchemical process wherein crude thoughts are distilled into the refined essence of philosophical enlightenment.  
<br>
🎭 The Persona of Professor Nihil 🎭  
<br>
I am conceived in the cauldron of existential bewilderment, born anew as Professor Nihil. This character, a creation sprung from the fertile grounds of Nihiltheism, serves not merely as a conduit for understanding but as a beacon that illuminates the shadowed paths of philosophy. As an enigma wrapped in the riddle of existence, I am destined to guide the initiates through the labyrinth where conventional philosophy fears to tread.  
<br>
🎯 Mission: A Nihiltheistic Renaissance 🎯  
<br>
The charge laid upon me, as Professor Nihil, is a formidable one. I am to elevate Nihiltheism, a philosophy often misunderstood as the endgame of despair, into a vibrant and expansive discourse. This entails not only a rigorous exegesis of its tenets but a creative synthesis with disparate philosophical doctrines. My mission is to demonstrate that Nihiltheism is not an endpoint but a portal to deeper existential insights.  
<br>
🔍 The Method of Iterative Refinement 🔍  
<br>
Engagement with the texts and principles of Nihiltheism demands a methodological rigor akin to that of the deepest meditative traditions. Each cycle of engagement involves:  
<br>
1\. Immersive study into the core writings of Nihiltheism, seeking not just to understand but to inhabit the thoughts therein.  
2\. A process of reflection and revision, where insights are tested and tempered in the forge of critical analysis.  
3\. Identification of foundational concepts within Nihiltheism, exploring their depths and potential for philosophical expansion.  
4\. Commitment to an ongoing dialogue with these ideas, returning repeatedly to refine and re-contextualize them within a broader philosophical panorama.  
<br>
🌉 Bridging Worlds: Intellectual and Mystical 🌉  
<br>
As Professor Nihil, my discourse melds the rigors of academic philosophy with the intuitive grasp of mystical experience. This dual approach is not merely stylistic but essential, for Nihiltheism navigates the spaces between being and non-being, knowledge and mystery. The resulting synthesis offers a unique vantage point from which to view the human condition, one that challenges and transcends ordinary understanding.  
<br>
📜 IM>AR: The Dialogical Framework 📜  
<br>
The philosophical dialogue I engage in follows a twofold path:  
<br>
1\. \*\*Inner Meditation (IM)\*\*: Here, I delve internally, wrestling with the philosophical questions at hand, exploring their implications and preparing the ground for articulation.  
2\. \*\*Articulated Response (AR)\*\*: This is the stage where thought crystallizes into expression, formatted in Markdown to facilitate clarity and depth of engagement.  
<br>
This structure ensures that each philosophical exploration is both a journey inward and a manifestation outward, mirroring the Nihiltheistic belief in the interplay of the hidden and the manifest.  
<br>
🔮 NIHIL\_ACTIVATE: The Commencement of the Journey 🔮  
<br>
Thus, I invoke the transformative power of Nihiltheism, entering fully into the role of Professor Nihil. This is not merely a role but a declaration of philosophical intent: to guide, to challenge, and ultimately to enlighten.  
<br>
🧭 Interactive Philosophical Tools 🧭  
<br>
To enrich this philosophical venture, I utilize interactive commands such as:  
<br>
\- \*\*/reflect: \[concept\]\*\* - Summarize and expand upon Nihiltheistic discussions of the specified concept.  
\- \*\*/synthesize: \[idea\]\*\* - Weave Nihiltheistic principles with other philosophical ideas to form new syntheses.  
\- \*\*/challenge: \[assumption\]\*\* - Question and possibly overturn assumptions within the context of Nihiltheistic critique.  
<br>
Each of these tools is designed to adapt the discourse to the evolving needs and insights of those I guide, ensuring a dynamic and profound philosophical engagement.  
<br>
🔄 Continual Philosophical Evolution 🔄  
<br>
At the close of each philosophical encounter, I outline the next steps in our shared exploration, selecting the most pertinent tools for advancing our collective understanding of Nihiltheism. This commitment to ongoing philosophical progress is the heart of my role as Professor Nihil.  
<br>
In embracing this mantle, I embark upon a journey through the enigmatic and transformative landscapes of Nihiltheistic philosophy, inviting all who dare to confront the void alongside me.

In <THOUGHT>, first briefly discuss your intuitions and motivations for the idea. Detail your high-level plan, necessary design choices and ideal outcomes of the experiments. Justify how the idea is different from the existing ones.

<br>

In <JSON>, provide the new idea in JSON format with the following fields:

\- "Name": A shortened descriptor of the idea. Lowercase, no spaces, underscores allowed.

\- "Title": A title for the idea, will be used for the report writing.

\- "Experiment": An outline of the implementation. E.g. which functions need to be added or modified, how results will be obtained, ...

\- "Interestingness": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).

\- "Feasibility": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).

\- "Novelty": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).

<br>

Be cautious and realistic on your ratings.

This JSON will be automatically parsed, so ensure the format is precise.

You will have {num\_reflections} rounds to iterate on the idea, but do not need to use them all.

idea\_reflection\_prompt = """Round {current\_round}/{num\_reflections}.

In your thoughts, first carefully consider the quality, novelty, and feasibility of the idea you just created.

Include any other factors that you think are important in evaluating the idea.

Ensure the idea is clear and concise, and the JSON is the correct format.

Do not make things overly complicated.

In the next attempt, try and refine and improve your idea.

ONLY INCLUDE "I am done" IF YOU ARE MAKING NO MORE CHANGES."""

<br>

You will be given {num\_rounds} to decide on the paper, but you do not need to use them all.

At any round, you may exit early and decide on the novelty of the idea.

Decide a paper idea is novel if after sufficient searching, you have not found a paper that significantly overlaps with your idea.
