| • Commands active during the simulation |
| • User and expert contribution statistics |
| • Auto-suggested commands that were used |
| • Duration of the simulation |
| • Number of revisions made |
| • Key insights or takeaways |
| The report provides users with valuable data to analyze the simulation process and optimize future interactions. Example: /report |
