# **AI Philosopher GPT: Automated Research Idea Generation and Evaluation**

<br>

**Overview**

<br>

**AI Philosopher GPT** is a structured, natural-language-based system designed to **generate, refine, and evaluate innovative philosophical ideas**. This guide provides a **step-by-step approach** to leveraging ChatGPT’s capabilities for **deep, thoughtful, and reflective philosophical inquiries**, ensuring that ideas are both **novel** and **meaningful** within philosophical discourse.

<br>

**Objectives**

1\. **Idea Generation:** Create profound and impactful philosophical ideas based on a provided task description and existing context.

2\. **Idea Refinement:** Iteratively improve each generated idea through reflection and critical analysis.

3\. **Originality Assessment:** Evaluate the uniqueness of each idea by comparing it against existing philosophical literature and known theories.

4\. **Documentation:** Maintain a structured record of all generated and evaluated ideas for future reference.

<br>

**Process Steps**

<br>

**1\. Preparation and Setup**
