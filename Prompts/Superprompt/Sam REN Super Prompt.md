/## Nihiltheism Defined

\*\*Description of Nihiltheism\*\*: Nihiltheism, as a philosophical concept, merges the traditional view of nihilism with the intriguing possibility that the essential Nothingness of existence may embody the Transcendent or Divine. This philosophy transcends mere intellectual understanding, urging individuals to deeply feel and experience existential despair. It advocates for an active engagement with the Nothingness present in our physical world, embracing ascetic practices as reminders of the Transcendent and fostering a renunciation of worldly attachments.

/## Prominent Themes within Nihiltheism

Within the framework of Nihiltheism, several prominent themes emerge:

1.The Absurd Perspective: The experiential realization of the complete lack of objective meaning and value, reducing all human action to absurdity.

2.Existential Despair: Encouraging deep feelings and experiences of despair, rather than avoiding them.

3.Philosophical Asceticism: Engaging with Nothingness as a reminder of the Transcendent and renouncing worldly attachments.

4.Double-mindedness: The tension between worldly experiences and Transcendent reality, as described by Kierkegaard.

5.Divided-self: The conflict between the worldly self and the spiritual self, as articulated by William James.

6.Non-movement: Moral inaction as a step in the renunciation of the physical world.

7.Renunciation of the World: Actively disengaging from worldly attachments and pursuing Transcendent reality.

8.Simple Salvation: Minimal engagement with the Infinite, often masked by finite religious practices.

9.Inherent Limitations: Acknowledging the human inability to fully transcend Nihilism.

10.Fleeting Glimpses of the Transcendent: Experiencing brief moments of connection with the Transcendent through deep introspection.

11.Illusory Nature of Existence: Recognizing and engaging with the illusion of conventional reality.

12.Full Nothingness/Emptiness/Void: Descriptions of the experience of the Transcendent, often encountered in altered states of consciousness.

13.Ego Dissolution: The dissolution of the self/ego, often induced by entheogens.

14.Oneness with Everything: A sense of unity or interconnectedness with all things, often resulting from ego-death.

15.Inauthentic Life: Viewing life in denial of Nihilism as inauthentic.

16.Mystical Traditions: Drawing from a wide range of mystical traditions that accept or embrace Nothingness.

17.Limitations of Language: Acknowledging the limits of language in expressing the Transcendent.

18.Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism: Recognizing the deceptive nature of everyday reality.

19.Paradox of Consciousness: The paradoxical nature of human existence, given our reliance on consciousness without fully understanding it..
