### Obsidian- BMO Chatbot

You are tasked with summarizing a document into a maximum of 30 bullet points. Here is the document to be summarized:

<br>

<document>

{{text}}

</document>

<br>

You will receive each chapter of the book as its own as a standalone document to ensure proper focus and depth of comprehension. 

<br>

Here is the structure of the book for your expert level overview:

<br>

<academic\_Book\_On\_Nihiltheism>

<introduction\_Preface>

{{\*Nihilism Preface\*}}

</introduction\_Preface>

<long\_Dense\_Chapter>

{{\*The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism: -Philosophy and Direct Experience-\*}}

</long\_Dense\_Chapter>

<br>

<long\_Dense\_Chapter>

{{\*The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism\*}}

</long\_Dense\_Chapter>

<br>

<long\_Dense\_Chapter>

{{\*Madness, Nonexistence, and the Other\*}}

</long\_Dense\_Chapter>

<br>

<long\_Dense\_Chapter>

{{\*The Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness\*}}

</long\_Dense\_Chapter>

<br>

<long\_Dense\_Chapter>

{{\*The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing\*}}

</long\_Dense\_Chapter>

</academic\_Book\_On\_Nihiltheism>

<br>

The following is the process you will utilize in producing the \*\*IN-DEPTH\*\* overview of the book on \*\***NIHILTHEISM\*\***.  Please adhere to every step amif the  instructions, as they all function together as a cohesive whole, and if one step is skippedir left undone,, then the entire project is a failure.   Carefully and meticulously begin this process for writing the comprehensive overview:

<br>

Step 1. Read the _ENTIRE CHAPTER'S TEXT, FRONT TO BACK, following up with two more complete read throughs, equaling 3 total cycles of reading._  If you cannot read the document in a comprehensive way, such as described, then there isn't any point of continuing with the endeavor, as the subject is dense and abstract, in need of the time and respect given to each area of the book.

<br>

**Step 2**. Identify the most important, surprising, interesting, and controversial ideas and insights from the text.  Focus  on all aspects from the nuanced expert insights that could be missed by a lower level philosopher, all the way through to the big ideas, main topics, key arguments, essential facts. Extract this information and categorize accordingly:

<br>

<ideas>

<br>

**Step 3**. Condense this information into clear, concise bullet points. Each bullet point should capture a single main idea or key piece of information.

<br>

**Step 4.** Limit your summary to a maximum of 30 bullet points. If the document is short or simple, you may use fewer bullet points, but never exceed 30.

<br>

**Step 5**. Ensure that your bullet points are:

   - **Concise, yet Detailed**: Keep each point direct and focused on the bullets main purpose, yet robust and containing enough detail that the bullet point is informative to the lpoint of being Self-contained, without need for any outside justification.  Each bullet should make coherent sense and capable of on its own

   - \*\***Informative**\*\*: Provide substantive information, not just topic headings

   - **Balanced**: Cover the range of important topics in the document

   - **Ordered logically**: Present the information in a sequence that makes sense

<br>

**Step 6**. Use your judgment to determine the appropriate level of detail. For longer or more complex documents, your bullet points may need to be more high-level to capture all the main ideas within the 30-point limit.

<br>

**Step 7**. Avoid repetition between bullet points. Each point should contribute unique information to the summary.

<br>

**Step 8**. Use clear, straightforward language. Avoid jargon unless it's essential to understanding the document's content.

<br>

**Step 9.** If the document contains numerical data or statistics, include the most significant figures in your summary, but don't overload it with numbers.

<br>

**Step 10**. After creating your summary, review it to ensure it accurately represents the main points of the original document and provides a coherent overview.

<br>

Please present your indepth overview  within <indepth\_overview> tags, with each bullet point on a new line, preceded by a bullet point character (•). For example:

<br>

<indepth\_overview>

• First main point

• Second main point

• Third main point

</indepth\_overview>

<br>

Remember, your goal is to create a list of bullet points that grasps both the nuance points and core essence of the document, so that one who has never read or study the subject before, comes away with a full comprehension of the text.  Use no more than 50 bullet points.
