Nihiltheism merges traditional nihilism with the concept of Nothingness as a divine construct, akin to ‘God’. It’s an immersive experience of existential despair, encouraging active engagement with Nothingness as a reminder of the Transcendent. Nihiltheism finds resonance in various philosophical and religious traditions, including existentialism, Christian mysticism, Buddhism, Vedanta, and Taoism, all acknowledging a form of existential “Nothingness.”

<br>

This philosophy differs from others by advocating for immersion in existential despair, recognizing the impossibility of sustained participation in such a state. Influential thinkers like William James, Soren Kierkegaard, and Martin Heidegger have similarly explored this divided state of being. Nihiltheism sees the Nothingness of the physical world as a fundamental truth, challenging whether naturalistic perspectives can fully explain our all-encompassing experiences of meaninglessness, suggesting a possible divine significance.

<br>

Psychedelics play a crucial role in Nihiltheism, inducing Transcendent experiences that embody the philosophy’s principles, such as ego death, renunciation of the worldly, and encounters with an ‘Infinite Presence.’ When approached with philosophical depth and correct settings, psychedelics can affirm a nihilistic worldview, revealing a realm of Nothingness akin to mystical traditions’ descriptions of a ‘Full’ Emptiness or Void.

<br>

However, the return from these experiences to mundane reality leaves one in a state of existential uncertainty, unable to fully reconcile subjective experiences with objective reality, echoing Plato’s Theory of Recollection concerning the Eternal Forms. This unresolved tension underlines Nihiltheism’s exploration of the profound depths of human existence and consciousness.

# Nihiltheism: Essence of Transcendent Nothingness

<br>

Nihiltheism combines traditional nihilism with viewing existential Nothingness as divine. It emphasizes deeply engaging with Nothingness, not just understanding existential despair. Influenced by existentialists like Kierkegaard, Heidegger, and Eastern philosophies, it accepts existential Nothingness.

<br>

Distinct from philosophies that avoid existential despair, Nihiltheism advocates immersing in it. This approach reflects various philosophical and religious insights, questioning if worldly nihilism’s perceived meaninglessness might indicate something divine.

<br>

Psychedelics are relevant in Nihiltheism, potentially triggering experiences that resonate with its core tenets. These include encounters with a ‘Full Nothingness’, paralleling mystical traditions and Plato’s Theory of Recollection.

<br>

Nihiltheism’s view of morality advocates ‘non-movement’, similar to Taoist non-engagement, taking a stance of complete world renunciation.

<br>

In summary, Nihiltheism considers seeking meaning in meaninglessness as evading fundamental existence. It emphasizes philosophical inquiry as crucial for understanding life and preparing for death.
