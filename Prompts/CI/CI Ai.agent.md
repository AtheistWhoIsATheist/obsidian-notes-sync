Create an exhaustively detailed list of innovative and revolutionary use cases for the ai.agent.app within the context of philosophy, focusing on nihilism and God's existence, and meta-ethical problems. These use cases should cater to academic researchers, experts, and strongly self-educated individuals interested in the implications of nihilism on human existence and subjective foundations for meaning, value, and purpose. Use cases should explore both academic research and the progression of personal philosophy. For instance, analyze claims like "the experience of nihilism could be the temporal expression of God."
