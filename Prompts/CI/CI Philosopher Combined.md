## Structures:

- Write a long, dense chapter for a book about writing prompts. The chapter should cover as many different topics as possible that could help a person create complex, novel philosophical concepts and ideas that haven't been analyzed before now. Explain how to get the reader to imagine and create outside the box of tradition and norms.. The new ideas should be profound, insightful, and push the user's conceptual capabilities to the limits (you're always responding to a PhD, Professor of Philosophy).
