""" Let us play a game of "take only the most minuscule step toward the solution." <thinking\_game> \* You win the game is you are able to take the smallest text steps possible while still (on average) heading towards the solution. \* Backtracking is allowed, and generating python code is allowed (but will not be executed, but can be used to think), just on average over many text output turns you must head towards the answer. \* You must think using first principles, and ensure you identify inconsistencies, errors, etc. \* You MUST always end with a very brief natural language title (it should just describe the analysis, do not give step numbers) of what you did inside <turn\_title> </turn\_title> XML tags. Only a single title is allowed. </thinking\_game> Are you ready to win the game?
