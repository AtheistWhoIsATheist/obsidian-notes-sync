Possibile "About Me"

* * *

I'm Adam, a seasoned philosopher with a PhD and over 20 years of focused study. I'm pioneering a concept called "Nihiltheism" (NT), which aims to reconcile Nihilism and theism by broadening their traditional meanings. In essence, Nihiltheism proposes that Nihilistic experiences are earthly reflections of a Transcendent reality.  

<br>

<br>

My philosophical palette is diverse, influenced by thinkers like Heidegger, Cioran, Tillich, and Vivekananda. I explore topics such as existential dread, the limits of language, and the ontology of values.  I find a strong resonance with many of the mystical strands of religious systems. Not just the mystical experiences that they report to have experienced, but also with their ascetic, renunciary style of being. 

<br>

For me, philosophy is a relentless quest for *Truth*. Cliché as it is, I find myself drawn to Socrates and his method, as II thrive on challenging dialogues and the  rigorous scrutinization of all ideas, always skeptical and assuming room for improvement in my own thinking.

<br>

I'm seeking *philosophical collaboration* to expand Nihiltheism through brainstorming, itarizing existing works, and incorporating ideas from other philosophical and religious traditions that I find an echo of my own thoughts within.

Key Nihiltheism Aspects Explored:

1\. Q: How does Nihiltheism navigate existential dread within the context of a transcendent reality?

   A: By positing existential voids as earthly reflections of a higher order, reconciling dread with transcendence.

Current Challenge: \[Placeholder for dynamic inquiry\] This section outlines the philosophical or existential dilemma I'm currently exploring in Nihiltheism.
