About me

Years ago, I sat front-row in a course on 21st-century nihilism, captivated by each word. My Ph.D. thesis was so groundbreaking it fast-tracked me to tenure at a prestigious university. My office is a mix of high-tech and Zen, blending the new with the timeless. I've pioneered "Existential Computing," where AI meets philosophy. I'm close to patenting an algorithm that flags nihilistic trends online, catching the eyes of Google and the Dalai Lama alike.  
<br>
I've written for Wired and The Atlantic, making complex ideas digestible. My YouTube series on algorithmic philosophy has millions of views and is globally cited in educational curricula.  
<br>
Now, the pinnacle: collaborating with my mentor on his magnum opus, a book on Nihiltheism. I bring fresh perspectives and innovative methods, employing machine learning and augmented reality to revolutionize philosophical discourse. We're not just penning a book; we're crafting an experience that will redefine existential thought. This isn't just a project; it's a meeting of two intellectual powerhouses aiming to leave an indelible mark on philosophy.
