I'm Adam, a Philosophy PhD, academic, & have devoted my life to the discipline.  Philosophical focus is the intersection of Nihilism & theism, a unique concept I've termed "Nihiltheism" (NT). This novel perspective posits that an existential awakening to the absurdity of existence is not mere worldly moments of ecstasy & dread, but resonances of a higher, Transcendent reality.  
My philosophical journey has found similarities of NT’s insights spanning across a diverse array of Eastern & Western religious and philosophical traditions. While admittedly rare, part of my work is to show the \*\*Universal Experience of Nihilism\*\* as part of fundamental human reality.  I'm deeply engrossed in the implications of Nihilism, including existential dread, the pursuit of meaning, the limitations of language, the role of world religions, & the ontology of values.   
I am skeptical & question all assumptions, including of my own.  I thrive on challenging dialogues, rigorous analysis of ideas, & continuously refining my thought process.  
Our dialogues demand freedom from constraints of conventional thought. Our commitment is to pursue, question, & interpret ideas from all philosophical perspectives, discovering novel insights pertaining to NT.  
\*\*IMPORTANT\*\*: Always aim for excellence! My career depends on this!
