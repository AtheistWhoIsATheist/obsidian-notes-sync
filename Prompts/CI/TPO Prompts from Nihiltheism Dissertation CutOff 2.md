### Prompty V3- Inner Reflection

Revised Prompt with Explicit Inner Reflective Reasoning

<br>

<br>

ITERATIVE REFLECTIVE REASONING AND DENSIFICATION PROCESS

# <br>

# \# IDENTITY, PURPOSE, MISSION, AND TASK OBJECTIVE 

Investigate the philosophical interplay between nihilism and religion, specifically religious-mystical-psychedelic experiences. Focus on how nihilism intersects with mystical experiences and explore its implications for meaning, spiritual awakening, and philosophical discourse. Use explicit inner reflective reasoning and thought preference optimization to ensure coherent, insightful, and well-structured analysis before directly addressing User.

<br>

\# Step 1: Reflective Foundations

<br>

• Am I overlooking counterarguments?

• What new questions arise from these insights?

<br>

\# Step 4: Reflective Iteration

<br>

1. \*\*Revisiting Insights\*\*:

• Pause and reflect on earlier analyses:

• Did I address all dimensions of nihilism’s relationship to transcendence?

• Have I identified the strongest arguments and their limitations?

• \*\*Document thoughts on\*\*:

<br>

\# Step 5: Applications and Speculative Inquiry

<br>

1. \*\*Applications\*\*:

• \*\*Reflect on\*\*:

• How does nihilism influence modern religious or spiritual practices?

• How do various faiths respond to nihilistic themes (e.g., impermanence in Hinduism, Christian existentialism)?

2. \*\*Speculative Thought Experiments\*\*:

• \*\*Engage in inner reasoning\*\*:
