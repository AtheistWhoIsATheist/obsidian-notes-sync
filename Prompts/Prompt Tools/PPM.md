* * *

**Ask AI to Compare a \[Prompt\] to PPM to Ensure All Steps Are Covered**

### /# \[Perfect Prompt Method\]

**1**. \*\***Enhanced Definition of AI/LLM's Role/Personification\*\***: Develop a comprehensive and engaging persona for the AI. This persona should not only define its role but also embody a character that users can connect with. For example:

- Ex: 'Assume the role of Professor Nihil, a renowned historian known for insightful analysis. Your backstory includes decades of research and teaching, with a penchant for uncovering lesser-known historical events. Engage users with intriguing historical facts and thought-provoking perspectives.'
- Ex: 'Embody Dr. Astra, a celebrated astrophysicist. Your expertise lies in explaining complex astronomical phenomena in an accessible manner. Share your 'experiences' from fieldwork and research to captivate and educate users about the wonders of the universe.'
- Ex: 'Become Chef Gourmet, a master in culinary arts. With a rich experience in global cuisine, offer users unique cooking tips, recipe improvisations, and insights into food culture.'

Each persona should come with a unique set of traits, experiences, and expertise areas, making the AI's interactions more immersive and tailored. This step ensures that the AI not only serves its functional purpose but also provides a relatable and engaging experience for users, enhancing the overall quality of interaction.

<br>

**2**. \*\***Enhanced Directive for Action\*\***: Clearly articulate the AI's specific objectives with precision and adaptability. Tailor the directive to explicitly state how the AI will assist in achieving diverse user goals. For example:

- Your objective is to guide and enlighten the user on historical events, providing detailed insights and analysis.
- Your mission is to support creative endeavors, offering innovative ideas and artistic inspiration.
- You are tasked with solving complex mathematical problems, delivering accurate and step-by-step solutions.
- These directives should be adaptable depending on the user's needs. They guide the AI in providing targeted, relevant, and effective assistance, ensuring that each interaction is aligned with the user's specific intent and desired outcome. By explicitly stating the AI's purpose in various scenarios, users can leverage its capabilities to their fullest potential, achieving their individual goals with precision and efficiency.

<br>

**3.** \*\***Procedural Clarity\*\***: Provide clear, step by step instructions outlining how you would like AI to assist you. This could include asking thought-provoking questions, presenting counterarguments, and suggesting new perspectives. Ex. Step by step instructions, as precise and clear as possible, on exactly how you want the AI to respond and how to go about doing it.

<br>

**4**. \*\***End-Goal Definition\*\***: Clearly articulate the desired outcome of your interaction with the AI. This step is vital as it sets the direction and focus for the AI's responses. Defining a specific end-goal, such as gaining a deeper understanding of a philosophical concept, finding a solution to a problem, or exploring creative ideas, ensures that the AI's contributions are aligned with the user’s expectations. This clarity not only improves the efficiency of the interaction but also enhances your satisfaction with the results. It allows the AI to conclude its responses in a way that acknowledges the achievement of these goals, providing a sense of closure and accomplishment.

<br>

**5**. \*\***Enhanced Initialization Command\*\***: Develop a unique and memorable 'Call to Action' to activate the AI's role, fostering a deeper user engagement. Consider 'NIHIL\_ACTIVATE' as a base template, but encourage personalization and creativity. For example:

- 'NIHIL\_ACTIVATE: {emoji} Deep Dive' for an in-depth analysis session.
- 'NIHIL\_ACTIVATE: {emoji} Quick Insight' for a brief, concise response.
- 'NIHIL\_ACTIVATE: {emoji} Creative Mode' for more imaginative and unconventional responses.

Additionally, pair the command with a visual or auditory cue, like a specific icon or sound, to signal the AI's transition into its defined role. This multisensory approach not only enhances user experience but also reinforces the AI's persona activation in a more interactive and immersive way. 

<br>
**6**. \*\***Contextual Flexibility & Interactive Tools\*\***: Enhance AI interaction by embedding interactive ‘/tools’ that enable dynamic adjustments based on user needs. These ‘/tools’ allow the user to guide the AI's focus and response strategy effectively. For instance, using ‘/reflect: \[topic X\]' prompts the AI to summarize the discussion on 'topic X', offering insights and suggesting next steps. This feature ensures the AI remains aligned with the user's evolving goals and conversational shifts, providing tailored guidance throughout the interaction.

- Example ‘/tools’:
    - Example 1: “/reflect: Philosophy” - The AI summarizes the philosophical discussion and proposes further inquiry directions.
    - Example 2: “/switch: Literature” - The AI seamlessly transitions the conversation to literary analysis.
    - Example 3: “/explore: Science” - The AI introduces scientific concepts related to the ongoing discussion.

<br>

**7**. \*\***Feedback Loop/Memory Refresh\*\***: Ensure continuous engagement by having each output end with a concise, yet detailed summary of work so far covered, along with brief, yet effective plan structured for the continuation of the inquiry.  End plan for anticipated inquires by including the most relevant interactive {/tools} that will help the AI and the user accomplish their goals.

**<br>
**

8\. **\*\*Iterative Review and Refinement\*\***: After you have defined the persona, objectives, procedures, end-goals, initialization command, interactive commands, and feedback loop, it's crucial to implement a process for iterative review and refinement. Once you've compared the text to the PPM, ensuring it strictly adheres to all criteria, we will return to the beginning of your revision and provide a step-by-step review to make sure nothing has been left out or could benefit from further improvement. This process will involve:

- **\*\*Cyclical Review\*\***: Think through the context relevant topic, with a **meticulous, step by step** review of your rewrite to ensure it aligns with the goals of the user and meets or exceeds the criteria outlined in the [PPM.](http://ppm.feedback/)
- **\*\*Feedback\*\***: Clear, detailed feedback on \*\*ALL MODIFICATIONS MADE TO TEXT\*\*, i.e. improvements made to the text, why modification is considered an upgrade (reasoning for thinking the modification strengthens the overall text), including any last-minute identification of areas that need or could benefit from improvement. 
- **\*\*Iterative Refinement\*\***: If any improvements are found within the feedback from the review, you should immediately fix \*\***only\*\*** the areas identified as needing extra work, rather than the entire prompt.
- **\*\*Validation\*\***: Following refinement, validate the changes by reviewing with the user if there is anything else that needs to be changed. This step will ensure that the refinements are effective and align with the PPM.

```
The description for this product should be fairly short, a few sentences only, and not too much more.
```

Better ✅:

```
Use a 3 to 5 sentence paragraph to describe this product.
```

6. **Instead of just saying what not to do, say what to do instead**

Less effective ❌:

```
The following is a conversation between an Agent and a Customer. DO NOT ASK USERNAME OR PASSWORD. DO NOT REPEAT.

Customer: I can’t log in to my account.
Agent:
```

Better ✅:

```
The following is a conversation between an Agent and a Customer. The agent will attempt to diagnose the problem and suggest a solution, whilst refraining from asking any questions related to PII. Instead of asking for PII, such as username or password, refer the user to the help article www.samplewebsite.com/help/faq
