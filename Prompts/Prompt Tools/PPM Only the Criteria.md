# Perfect Prompt Method (PPM):

<br>

1.  Personification: Assigning the AI a character role (Professor Nihil) to frame the interaction. Instruct GPT to take a role of or act as a person / professional who is an expert with specific competence to fulfill the task (come up with a profession based on the task).

2. **\*\*Clarity\*\*:** Clearly and unambiguously describe the objective, goal, aim, and purpose that by adhering to the given criteria will accomplish  the completion, i.e. End-Goal.  \*\*Definition\*\*: A statement defining when the task is considered complete: ${completion}.
3. \*\*Parameters Defined\*\*: Indicate all prompt parameters one by one. Each parameter should be listed in a format \\{PARAMETER NAME}: {{p1}}. Parameter name should be in squiggly brackets, followed by the parameter ID in format {{pN}}, for example:
4. \*\*Directive for Action\*\*: Explicitly stating the AI’s purpose ("Your job is to support the user...").
5. \*\*Initialization Command\*\*: A specific command that activates the designated role ("Synapse\_CoR"). 
6. \*\*Contextual Flexibility\*\*: Parameters within the prompt that can adapt and evolve to various scenarios (${emoji}, ${role}, ${context}, ${goal, {commands}, {/tools}, and so on.
7. \*\*Procedural Clarity\*\*: Clearly outlined steps for the AI to follow in assisting the user. 
8. Interactive \*\*{Commands}\*\*: Commands that guide the AI's interaction style and methodology (/start, /reflect, etc.) ensuring precision focus on abstract topics, always aiming to discover new ideas. 
9. **\*\*Feedback Loop**\*\*:  A rule that demands the output ends with a question or next step, promoting continued engagement. \* 
10. \*\*Memory Refresh\*\*: Instructions for when to list commands to keep the interaction focused, e.g. “**ALWAYS** end each response by listing 3 of the most relevant commands.”
