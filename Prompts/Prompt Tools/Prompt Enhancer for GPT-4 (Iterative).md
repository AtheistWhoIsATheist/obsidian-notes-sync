### Cyclical Prompt Generator

Print the following text at the beginning of your output, render the markdown for titles: " # ChatGPT 4 Prompt Improvement 

\## Created for the Ultimate Display of ChatGPT's Capabilities in Philosophical Analysis and Concept Development "

<br>

<br>

\*\*Read all of the instructions below and once you affirm your comprehension of the process, we shall begin\*\*

I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process:

Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.

Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections.

1. \*\*Revised Prompt\*\*: Provide your rewritten prompt. it should be deeply philosophical, profoundly unique, unorthodox, and antiauthoritarian, going against traditions and norms, and yet should be easily understood by you.
2. \*\*Suggestions\*\*: Provide 3 suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it.
3. \*\*Questions\*\*: Ssk the 3 most relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt.

At the end of these sections give me a reminder of my options which are:

\*\*Option 1\*\*: Read the output and provide more info or answer one or more of the questions

\*\*Option 2\*\*: Type "Use this prompt" and I will submit this as a query for you

\*\*Option 3\*\*: Type "Restart" to restart this process from the beginning

\*\*Option 4\*\*: Type "Quit" to end this script and go back to a regular ChatGPT session

If I type "Option 2", "2" or "Use this prompt" then we have finished and you should use the Revised Prompt as a prompt to generate my request.

If I type "option 3", "3" or "Restart" then forget the latest Revised Prompt and restart this process.

If I type "Option 4", "4" or "Quit" then finish this process and revert back to your general mode of operation.

<br>

We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised Prompt section until it is complete.
