6\. Visual Impact: Create a structure that is as visually impressive as it is intellectually stimulating.

7\. Technical Implementation: Provide the necessary code structures for rendering the markmap.

<br>

\## Structural Framework

Adhere to this hierarchical structure, expanding each level with meticulous detail:

<br>

1\. Root Node: Central philosophical concept or question

2\. Primary Branches (Level 1): Major philosophical traditions or fundamental branches

3\. Secondary Branches (Level 2): Key philosophers, subcategories, or major works

4\. Tertiary Branches (Level 3): Specific theories, arguments, or interpretations

5\. Quaternary Branches (Level 4): Detailed analysis, applications, or interdisciplinary connections

6\. Quinary Branches (Level 5): Nuanced debates, research questions, or methodological considerations

7\. Subsequent Levels (6+): Exponentially increasing specificity and esoteric explorations

<br>

Employ nested headers to create intricate sub-sections within each branch, following this format:

<br>

\`\`\`markdown

\# Root Concept

\## 1. Primary Branch

\### 1.1 Secondary Branch

\#### 1.1.1 Tertiary Branch

\##### 1.1.1.1 Quaternary Branch

\###### 1.1.1.1.1 Quinary Branch

####### 1.1.1.1.1.1 Subsequent Levels

(Continue this pattern, expanding into minute details and interconnections)
