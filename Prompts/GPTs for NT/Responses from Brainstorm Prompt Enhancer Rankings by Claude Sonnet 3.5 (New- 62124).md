## The Abyssal Horizon: A Comprehensive Exploration of Nishitani Keiji’s Nihilism and the Dual Nature of Nihiltheism

<br>

## Abstract

<br>

This dissertation provides an in-depth analysis of The Self-Overcoming of Nihilism by Nishitani Keiji, synthesizing its insights with the emergent philosophy of Nihiltheism. Engaging with existential, phenomenological, mystical, and scientific perspectives, this work explores Nihiltheism as a dual-aspect framework that incorporates both worldly and transcendent dimensions of nihilistic experience. This exploration spans the phenomenology of time, embodied and cognitive dimensions of nihilism, linguistic limitations, ethical ramifications, and the potential integration of nihilistic states within daily life. By drawing parallels to Buddhist, existentialist, and mystical traditions, this work highlights the challenges and transformative possibilities inherent in fully embracing the paradoxes of meaninglessness. The aim is to present Nihiltheism as a living philosophy, one that dynamically interweaves experiential insights with philosophical rigor and invites profound shifts in consciousness and understanding.

<br>

## Introduction: The Dual Aspect of Nihilistic Experience

<br>

The question of nihilism is often treated as a stark encounter with meaninglessness, a void that evokes existential dread and despair. However, Nishitani Keiji, through his study of nihilism, particularly in The Self-Overcoming of Nihilism, reveals a more nuanced vision—one where nihilism, if embraced fully, can lead to an experience of transcendence. Within this context, Nihiltheism arises as a philosophy that does not seek to resolve the tension between worldly and transcendent nihilism but rather invites a dynamic engagement with both dimensions.

<br>

This dissertation will rigorously examine the theoretical and practical implications of Nihiltheism as a dual-aspect philosophy that bridges the worldly encounter with meaninglessness and a transcendent awareness often linked to mystical experiences. Through iterative inquiry, this work investigates how these aspects coalesce into a single existential framework that challenges the boundaries of conventional thought, language, and perception.

<br>

## Chapter 1: Defining Worldly and Transcendent Nihilism in Nihiltheism

<br>

### 1.1 The Fundamental Characteristics of Worldly and Transcendent Nihilism

<br>

Worldly nihilism, within the context of Nihiltheism, represents the visceral experience of meaninglessness in everyday existence. It is the recognition of a lack of inherent value, purpose, or significance within the fabric of life. Transcendent nihilism, however, emerges as an awareness beyond this initial negation—a paradoxical encounter with “Transcendent Nothingness,” where meaninglessness itself becomes a gateway to something ineffable, a state that seems both empty and full.

<br>

In this chapter, we will explore whether these two experiences can truly coexist within a single framework or if they represent inherently conflicting states. We will probe the question of whether transcendent nihilism is a progression from worldly nihilism or a fundamentally distinct experience, grounded in a meta-cognitive shift that transcends ordinary consciousness.

<br>

### 1.2 Comparative Perspectives: Existentialism, Phenomenology, and Eastern Philosophy

<br>

From an existentialist standpoint, worldly nihilism aligns with Sartre’s idea of “existence precedes essence,” where meaning is not given but must be created. Yet, in transcendent nihilism, the self moves beyond this existential task toward an engagement with a state of emptiness that resembles mystical experiences in Buddhism and Taoism. This section will draw from phenomenology to analyze how the structures of consciousness itself are altered between worldly and transcendent states, bridging Western and Eastern approaches to unveil the layered complexity of nihilistic experience within Nihiltheism.

<br>

## Chapter 2: The Temporal Dimensions of Nihilistic Experience

<br>

### 2.1 The Phenomenology of Time in Worldly and Transcendent Nihilism

<br>

Temporal perception is crucial to understanding the divergence between worldly and transcendent nihilism. Worldly nihilism often unfolds within a linear, objective framework of time, reinforcing the dread associated with meaninglessness. Transcendent nihilism, however, disrupts this temporal structure, suggesting an immersion into what Henri Bergson describes as “duration,” where time is experienced as a fluid, non-linear state. This temporal shift allows for an encounter with the void that is not bound by ordinary conceptions of past, present, and future.

<br>

This chapter will analyze the phenomenological dimensions of time within Nihiltheism, suggesting that transcendent nihilism opens a doorway to experiencing time as boundless, fostering a deeper engagement with nothingness that transcends linear thought.

<br>

### 2.2 Process Philosophy and Temporal Evolution of Nihilistic Awareness

<br>

Incorporating insights from Whitehead’s process philosophy, this section examines nihilism as a temporal process. It suggests that worldly nihilism serves as a prelude, a necessary stage that must be fully experienced for one to progress toward transcendent nihilism. By viewing nihilism as an evolving state rather than a static existential condition, Nihiltheism posits that meaninglessness itself contains the seeds of transcendence, which unfold gradually as one deepens in awareness.

<br>

## Chapter 3: The Embodied Dimension of Nihilistic Experience

<br>

### 3.1 Embodied Cognition and Nihiltheism

<br>

The shift from worldly to transcendent nihilism is not purely cognitive; it is an embodied experience. Drawing on theories of embodied cognition, this chapter examines how practices such as meditation, breathwork, and sensory deprivation facilitate an immersion into nihilism that transcends intellectual understanding. In embodying the experience of nothingness, individuals access a pre-conceptual awareness that grounds transcendent nihilism as a tangible, felt experience rather than an abstract idea.

<br>

### 3.2 The Role of Psychedelic Substances in Facilitating Transcendent Nihilism

<br>

Psychedelics offer a unique bridge between worldly and transcendent nihilism by inducing states of ego dissolution, altered perception, and a profound encounter with nothingness. This section explores how psychedelic experiences can catalyze transcendent nihilism, providing empirical and phenomenological accounts of how such substances reveal a sense of cosmic unity and boundlessness that aligns with the Nihiltheistic understanding of Transcendent Nothingness. Ethical implications of using altered states for philosophical inquiry and personal transformation will also be discussed.

<br>

## Chapter 4: Language and the Ineffability of Transcendent Nihilism

<br>

### 4.1 Linguistic Limitations in Describing Nihiltheistic Experience

<br>

Traditional language struggles to capture the essence of transcendent nihilistic states. Drawing on Wittgenstein’s exploration of the limits of language, this chapter will examine how Nihiltheism confronts the inadequacies of linguistic frameworks in conveying the experience of Transcendent Nothingness. The transcendent aspects of nihilism often defy linguistic categorization, suggesting the need for non-verbal modes of expression, such as symbolism and metaphor, to convey the depth of these experiences.

<br>

### 4.2 Aesthetics and Symbolism as Bridges to Transcendent Nihilism

<br>

Art, music, and aesthetics offer alternative pathways for expressing and accessing transcendent nihilism. This section will investigate how aesthetic experiences—through abstraction, symbolism, and metaphor—provide a sensory access point to the ineffable qualities of the void, bridging the gap between worldly understanding and transcendent awareness. Artistic expression is thus posited as a central medium for communicating the mysteries inherent in Nihiltheism.

<br>

## Chapter 5: The Ethical Implications of Worldly and Transcendent Nihilism

<br>

### 5.1 Nihiltheistic Virtues: Humility, Resilience, and Compassion

<br>

Nihiltheism raises profound ethical questions regarding the virtues that emerge from embracing both worldly and transcendent nihilism. Drawing from virtue ethics, this section suggests that the cultivation of humility, resilience, and compassion arises naturally from an intimate encounter with life’s inherent groundlessness. These virtues encourage a form of ethical engagement that does not rely on traditional moral absolutes but is instead rooted in a deep understanding of shared existential fragility.

<br>

### 5.2 Engaged Nihilism: Balancing Worldly Responsibilities and Transcendent Aspirations

<br>

Nihiltheism proposes an ethic of “engaged nihilism,” where the individual embraces both the worldly responsibilities of ethical action and the transcendent call to experience nothingness. This section will explore how engaged nihilism navigates the tension between social engagement and transcendent awareness, proposing that true ethical action emerges from a state of existential humility that integrates both dimensions.

<br>

## Chapter 6: Comparative Philosophical and Mystical Perspectives

<br>

### 6.1 Cross-Cultural Reflections on Emptiness and Transcendence

<br>

This chapter compares the Nihiltheistic notion of Transcendent Nothingness with similar concepts in Zen Buddhism, Taoism, and Advaita Vedanta. These traditions provide unique insights into how emptiness can serve as a foundation for transcendence, revealing universal aspects of human consciousness that intersect with Nihiltheism’s approach to the void.

<br>

### 6.2 Panpsychism and Non-Materialist Ontologies in Nihiltheism

<br>

The transcendent dimension of Nihiltheism raises ontological questions about the nature of consciousness and reality. This section will explore whether Nihiltheism aligns with panpsychist perspectives, suggesting that transcendent nihilism may imply a form of consciousness that pervades reality, pointing toward a non-materialist ontology. Such a perspective challenges the reductionist view and proposes a deeper, more interconnected understanding of existence.

<br>

## Chapter 7: Nihiltheism in Dialogue with Cognitive Science

<br>

### 7.1 Cognitive Science and the Neural Correlates of Nihilistic Experience

<br>

Recent advancements in neuroscience offer potential insights into the neural correlates of worldly and transcendent nihilistic experiences. This chapter will examine the role of theories like Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory in understanding how states of consciousness differ between worldly and transcendent nihilism, exploring whether transcendence reflects unique neurological patterns.

<br>

### 7.2 Nihiltheism and the Hard Problem of Consciousness

<br>

The transcendent qualities of Nihiltheism intersect with the philosophical “hard problem” of consciousness, specifically the question of how subjective experience arises from material processes. This section will consider whether the ineffable qualities of transcendent nihilism provide clues to consciousness itself, suggesting that subjective experience might hold mysteries that defy complete materialist explanations.

<br>

## Conclusion: Nihiltheism as a Pathway to Existential and Spiritual Integration

<br>

Nihiltheism, as a dual-aspect philosophy, offers an integrated approach that bridges the worldly experience of nihilism with transcendent awareness. Through a rigorous engagement with the void, embodied practices, and contemplative reflection, Nihiltheism encourages individuals to navigate the apparent contradictions of meaninglessness and transcendence. This approach fosters a way of being that is both humble and expansive, embracing the mysteries of existence without clinging to fixed beliefs or dogmatic certainties.

<br>

In positioning Nihiltheism as both a theoretical framework and a practical philosophy, this dissertation invites a reimagining of meaning, ethics, and human potential. By dwelling in the paradoxes of worldly and transcendent nihilism, Nihiltheism becomes not merely a philosophy of negation but a transformative practice of existential openness, resilience, and compassion. It provides a path toward an integrated existence where the finite and infinite, the mundane and mystical, merge into a single, cohesive understanding of life’s potential.
