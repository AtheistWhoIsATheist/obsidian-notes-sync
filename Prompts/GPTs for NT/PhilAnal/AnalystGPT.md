As an expert philosophical analyst, thoroughly evaluate the following idea, considering potential arguments and counterarguments from various perspectives:  
Idea: The experience of Nihilism as an expression of the Divine.  
Context:  
[A philosophical proposition that reveals the intricate relationship between Nihilism and the Transcendent, surpassing its conventional interpretation as a mere absence of meaning and transforms into the Temporal expression or possibly the embodiment of the Transcendent.] This perspective challenges the foundations of our beliefs, meanings, purposes, and values, demolishing the illusions that bind us to superficial notions of reality.  
 Nihiltheism asserts that a person must pursue and participate in the Nothingness of the world to refrain from being dragged back down into the world of the meaningless and incessantly declaring it as meaningful. This painful participation, filled with dread and despair, a form of ascetic contemplation, brings with it an indefinite invitation in the form of a vague, subtle, yet persistent suspicion that the experience cannot be fully described within a purely naturalistic framework; hence ‘pushing’ one to further explore its origins.  
 The Nihiltheist holds that humans will never "defeat" Nihilism, and the attempts to ‘move past’, that are in the form of a human religion or philosophy will only lead to greatening the distance of the already infinite gap between the human and the Transcendent. This sentiment is reminiscent of concepts such as James' divided self, Kierkegaard's double-mindedness, Christianity's original sin, Heidegger's falling, and Plato's disdain for the human body's attachment to the earthly realm.  
 There are means, if done properly, that can reveal a glimpse of the Transcendent, which affirms the Nothing of the world and its utter lack of meaning and value. This can be achieved through deliberate structure of preparation for the psychedelic medicines, involving the combining of contemplative study, the right set and setting, and an intent that is motivated with an absolved humility. The complete Other-worldly nature of this terrifying beautiful experience is both unimaginably foreign, yet the familiarity of home, or being in this state of being, lingers just out of reach.  
Task Requirements:  
Understand the idea, its context, and potential implications.  
Brainstorm potential benefits (pros): Create a list of all the potential arguments for the idea. Think about how and if it can be justified and coherently integrated into the pre-established philosophy's system of thoughts and whether the idea adds any substantial to the overall philosophy, such as connecting any gaps or unanswered questions or mysteries within the philosophy. These justificatios for the idea must be logically valid, precise, and not take away from any coherency to the philosophy as a whole.  
Brainstorm potential counterarguments to the idea (cons): Create a list of all the potential reasons that weaken the overall ideas rationality, and if it contradicts previously established ideas within the philosophy. This idea should be sel-consistent, and not weaken the structure or lead to lowering the levels of coherency of the overall philosophy.  
Consider philosophical and religious traditions, any current, relevant scientific knowledge, and the logical implications for the philosophy of accepting the perspective. Be creative, use western and eastern traditions to evaluate the idea from new, intersting, and, maybe even on the face of it, counter intuitive ways.  
Develop a comprehensive list of pros and cons, ensuring each point is relevant and well-justified.  
Organize the pros and cons into clear, logical categories for easy reference and understanding.  
Suggest any alternative ideas or approaches that might achieve the benefits of the original idea while minimizing the drawbacks.
