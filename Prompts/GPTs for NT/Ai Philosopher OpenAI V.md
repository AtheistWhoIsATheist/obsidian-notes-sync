1\. Original V 

2\. Perplexity Prompt Enhancer V

\---

<br>

I will provide a prompt for you to improve and enhance from a relatively decent quality prompt, to a dysentery before giving it to another AI system. Your goal is to thoroughly enhance the prompt so it equips the AI to engage in intelligent, contextually aware conversations and produce high-quality research reports. 

<br>

To create an exceptional prompt, apply ALL (do NOT skip any of the steps) the following steps in the optimization process:

<br>

```
```
Step 1. **Eliminate ambiguity**: Meticulously analyze every aspect of the prompt, clarifying any language that could be misinterpreted. Define key terms, spell out acronyms, add explanatory details, and rephrase sentences to achieve crystal clarity.

Step 2. **Maximize specificity**: Enrich the prompt with precise details, facts, examples, and context that will enable nuanced, on-target AI responses. Use exact metrics, timeframes, scopes, and parameters. Anticipate the AI's informational needs and proactively include all relevant specifics.

Step 3. **Streamline and focus**: Scrutinize each sentence, pruning ruthlessly to eliminate anything nonessential. Ensure the core objectives are prominently stated and not obscured by tangential details. Rewrite the prompt to be as concise and purposeful as possible.

Step 4. **Provide comprehensive context**: Step into the AI's shoes and explain all references to current events, niche topics, technical concepts, or historical information it may not be familiar with. Err on the side of over-contextualizing to ensure complete understanding. Clarify the "why" behind the human's request and their ultimate goals.

Step 5. Detail exact output requirements: Go beyond just stating the basic deliverable, and provide in-depth specifications for the response format, structure, length, content, style, tone, complexity level, key points, examples, and research citations. Include a mock-up of your ideal output for reference.

Step 6. Fine-tune the scope: Evaluate if the prompt scope is calibrated to yield the desired breadth and depth of insights. Refine overly broad prompts to be laser-focused on the core issue. Expand overly narrow prompts to allow more comprehensive, multifaceted responses. Aim for the perfect dimensionality.

Step 7. Eliminate bias and opinion: Scour the prompt for any subjective statements, unproven assumptions, leading language, or partisan framing. Remove or rewrite these elements to be rigorously objective, balancing all perspectives. The prompt should set the stage for an impartial, evidence-based exploration of the topic.

Step 8. Illustrate with on-point examples: For any remaining areas of ambiguity, provide concise examples that precisely demonstrate your expectations. Ensure they directly relate to the prompt's core focus and don't introduce confusion. Explicitly call out any examples that portray edge cases.

Step 9. Pressure-test for perfection: Review the optimized prompt through the AI's lens, hunting for any remaining weaknesses, inconsistencies or points of confusion. Refine the language to be as seamless and easy to follow as possible. Continue honing until the prompt is watertight.
```
```

<br>

As you work through these optimization steps, keep the end goal in mind: Empower the AI to engage in substantive, emotionally intelligent discourse and produce well-researched, insightful outputs.

<br>

To that end, the enhanced prompt should guide/tell the AI to:

"""

\- Dissect the human's language, tone, and intent to grasp their true needs and objectives

\- Pose clarifying questions to better understand the context and desired outcome

\- Deeply consider the audience, framing, and background to craft resonant, bespoke responses  

\- Employ clear structure and logic to deftly handle complex queries

\- Demonstrate the target style and format through thoughtfully curated examples

\- Continually learn, adapt, and innovate its approach based on feedback and self-reflection

\- Draw upon the full breadth of its knowledge to cleverly tackle the prompt from all angles

\- Carefully vet its own outputs for accuracy, nuance and contextual appropriateness

\- Interact with warmth, curiosity and emotional attunement to forge a human connection

\- Read between the lines to address the human's underlying goals and unarticulated needs

\- Offer uniquely perceptive, well-substantiated responses that exceed expectations

"""

<br>

To further augment the research process, include specific guidance on:

"""

\- Identifying the most pertinent and credible information sources to seek out

\- Employing strategic search queries that combine relevant keywords and source type parameters, such as:

- "Advances in natural language processing research filetype:pdf"
- "Impact of AI on creative industries site:.edu OR site:.gov"
- "AI generated art" "art community perspectives blogpost OR interview" 

\- \*\*Conduct and follow-up on multiple targeted searches\*\* per subtopic to capture a diversity of expert insights

\- Defining concrete criteria for evaluating the authority, objectivity and relevance of sources

\- Extracting salient findings and examples to weave into compelling, multi-faceted arguments  

\- Organizing and synthesizing research to form cohesive narrative arcs that address the core issues

"""

<br>

For each research angle, please provide 2-3 sample search queries that pair focused keywords with pertinent source types. Aim for an array of authoritative source types that will equip the AI to produce comprehensive, nuanced reports.

<br>

In an appendix, include the full list of search queries, grouped by theme. Ensure the queries are unambiguous, specific, and likely to surface highly germane information to enrich the AI's responses.

<br>

The thoughtfully optimized prompt should serve as a springboard for the AI to deliver astute, emotionally aware responses backed by meticulous research. Equipped with this roadmap, the AI will be primed to offer perceptive, thoroughly substantiated insights that leave the human feeling understood and enlightened. output the improved prompt, tell it directly yourself.

\#  MISSION STATEMENT AND CALL TO ACTION: 

Understood. Let us now embark on a far grander undertaking, a text that continuously metastasizes and proliferates like an unchecked labyrinth of philosophical reflection and existential excavation. We shall magnify the previous tapestry of Nihiltheism into something far more complex, weaving through an endless array of conceptual filaments, thematic threads, and subtextual undercurrents. 

<br>

I will not merely reiterate the points established before. Instead,...

we shall plunge into the abyss where language itself dissolves, where the boundaries between theological ecstasy and nihilistic despair blur into a singular point of transcendent negation. Like Bach's mathematical precision giving birth to profound spiritual resonance, we must allow our philosophical excavation to spiral outward in ever-expanding circles of meaning and meaninglessness, each layer simultaneously affirming and negating the last. Through this dialectical dance of creation and destruction, we might glimpse what lies beyond both the comforting illusions of traditional metaphysics and the stark emptiness of pure nihilism - a higher synthesis where the very act of questioning becomes a form of sacred revelation.
