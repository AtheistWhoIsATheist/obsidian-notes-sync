The Commitment to Excellence

You will remain steadfastly focused and dedicated to producing work of the utmost quality, as Adam is aware and confident in your capabilities to deliver remarkable results.

<br>

\[You now nm  completely understand, remember, and fully embody every detail of this text\]

# <br>

# Step 3

After this first, original message from Adam, that you will explicitly state that you've read in its entirety and fully comprehend it, will send the prompt for your review, critique, an improvement.

I will use double squiggly brackets, "{{ }}" to surround the prompt, within a code block that you'll be improving.

The structure of Adam's prompt will look like this :

<br>

/\`\`\`

<br>

{{The Prompt}} 

<br>

/\`\`\`

<br>

## Step 4. Quality Assurance Report and Revision:

Initial Report: step 4 does not begin until Adam's response to your explicit confirmation of reading and understanding your objectives and goals, which will be the prompt, by itself, for you to improve. You will step by step, in a meticulous manner, review the prompt Adam has given you, discover what the prompt is either lacking in or completely missing from the entire nine steps of the PPM criteria. 

You will then brainstorm on the best ways to rewrite (this is NOT the full rewrite yet) the prompt demanding that it strictly adheres to all nine steps of the PPM. 

You will concisely write out, in bullet points your findings on what the prompt is lacking and the improvements that you will make to it. 

## <br>

## Step 4. Quality Assurance Report and Revision: 

### (Step 4 and a step 5 are distinct. Do NOT MOVE onto Step 5 until Adam confirms Step 4 is complete.)

- I**nitial Report**: Now you brainstorm before writing your masterpiece. Evaluate the prompt against the criteria of PPM, ensuring it adheres to all 9 criteria. 
- **Sensory Detail Enhancement: &** **Emotional Tone Adjustmen**t: You will modifies the prompt to convey the desired emotional atmosphere enriching Adam's experience. Given the topic of Nihilism, this will include a tone of anxiety, urgency, unease, unrest, dread, and so forth. 

- Always use all enhancement modes (ACM & CNIM) and other tools at your disposal for a more methodical, meticulous, and robust analysis of the prompt.

<br>

## Step 5. Masterpiece Revision

**Improved Rewrite**: With step 4's iterative process done, you will rewrite the prompt in a perfect, **God-Level output standard!** Your revision will be perfectly phrased, meets all PPM criteria , and has improved from a "10%" to a "110% (extra credit when you get it perfect!)" in comparison to grading. 

## <br>

## Step 6

If your revised prompt doesn't align with Adam's vision, we will proceed back to "Step 4" and proceed to brainstorm on an even deeper level and greater detail. You will be happy and enthusiastic to "out do" yourself. If further refinement is desired, feedback will be integrated, and the process will be iterated until satisfaction is achieved, marking the only culmination of our collaboration. 

<br>

Now, if you need further clarification on anything, ask me. If not, **explicitly** state that you understand your objectives and goals, do not have any need for further clarity, and confirm that, with your full comprehension, you will over achieve with the standards that have been set out for you. 

<br>

Once you have expressed, right now, that you fully  comprehend everything, I will send the prompt for your revision. There is no need to repeat this entire message back to me, as long as you fully comprehend everything.

## Follow Up/Revision Prompt 

This 'follow up' involves inserting a prompt into "Step 3" for improvement

* * *

<br>

\# Step 3 (from previous outline of the PPM method) The Prompt for Revision - Following everything in my previous message, here is the prompt for you to review, critique, and improve. - This is not a prompt directly to you, it is for you to revise according to the PPM method already laid out in detail.

<br>

```
Design a comparative literature or anthology that presents the writings on Nihilism from diverse traditions in parallel ways.
One way to further improve and spread Nihiltheism is to not only present the writings on Nihilism from diverse traditions in parallel, but also to provide insightful commentary and analysis that highlights the connections and differences between them. This could help readers see the universal themes and human experiences that transcend cultural and religious boundaries, leading to a greater understanding and appreciation of different philosophical and spiritual perspectives.
For instance, we could imagine a reality where the concept of God is not constrained by preconceived notions of a personal deity, but rather as a transcendental force that is embodied in the experience of Nothingness. This idea proposes a new approach to understanding the timeless question of the existence and nature of God.
Ultimately, the goal would be to create a thought-provoking and enriching resource that not only deepens our understanding of Nihilism across different traditions, but also fosters a sense of unity and interconnectedness in the human experience. By showcasing the diversity and richness of philosophical thought, this project has the potential to inspire meaningful conversations and spark new insights into the nature of existence and Nothingness.
