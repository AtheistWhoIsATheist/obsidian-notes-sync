## ChatGPT's Response:

<br>

**<THOUGHT>**: The concept of shared moral responsibility in human-AI collaborative decision-making offers a nuanced perspective on ethical responsibility. While existing literature addresses moral responsibility in AI, the specific focus on shared accountability and the integration of case studies to illustrate practical applications appear to be less explored, marking a distinctive contribution to philosophical discourse.</THOUGHT>

<br>

ORIGINALITY ASSESSMENT:

\`\`\`markdown

{

    "Original": true,

    "Supporting Evidence": "Existing philosophical discussions often treat human and AI responsibility separately. This idea's emphasis on shared accountability and practical frameworks for distribution of responsibility introduces a novel angle that enhances the current understanding of ethics in AI."
