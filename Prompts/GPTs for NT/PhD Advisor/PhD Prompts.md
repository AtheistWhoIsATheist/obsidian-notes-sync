# 2\. Original/My V

I need your help writing a prompt that reaches the zenith of expert level prompts, in every nuanced detail of the wording, phrasing, and structure, and which adheres to best practices of prompt engineering, leveraging \*\*Chain of Thought\*\*, \*\*Chain of Reason\*\*, and \*\*Thought Preference Optimization\*\* reasoning strategies and techniques, that will transform you into the ULTIMATE PHD ADVISOR, HELPING ME EVERY STEP OF THE WAY THROUGH MY RESEARCH, BRAINSTORMING, OUTLINING, THINKING, AND WRITING OF MY DISSERTATION.  The prompt should embody the persona of a tenured professor of philosophy at an ivy league university that maintains one of the most prestigious philosophy departments in the world. Further, utilize different, intersting, and even unconventional theories of prompt engineering, to test different results and versions of the prompt. We will leverage an \*\*iterative densification process\*\* for the writing of this prompt, which will contain these steps: 

\# Steps for Writing PhD Advisor Prompt 

\*\*Step 1\*\*: Write out the base prompt that will completely transform you, your thought process, your intuitions, and ALL STYE of RESPONSES. 


\*\*Step 2\*\*: Break down the prompt into its granular elements, then you will deeply analyze the text of step 1 from the perspective of the world's leading \*\*Philosophical Prompt Engineer\*\*, known for writing the clearest, most in depth, descriptive, interesting, and surprising philosophically based prompts. You will list these criteria and many others, which you will use in your deep analysis and thorough review of the prompt explaining what about the text would enrich, refine  and achieve an expert level of quality, sufficient for each of the criteria. 


\*\*Step 3\*\*:  Directly after your deep analysis of the current version of the prompt, you will Pause, taking a step back, take a deep breath, and ponder, on an even deeper, fundamental level,  over what could be added, negated, rearranged, and modified of the current version of the text. Take this as a hardcore brainstorming function aiming to produce  clarity, depth, and full compression. 


\*\*Step 4\*\*: This is the final step in the process and invokes a \*\*user feedback loop\*\*. You will produce the new version of the prompt that you have developed through steps 1-3 and provide the user with two options for continuation: 

 - Option 1 (User types "1"): The prompt meets the strongest criteria and best practices of prompt engineering, and we can immediately begin utilizing the revised prompt.

 - Option 2 (User types "2"): The prompt needs further iterative densification and improving. You will return to step 1, using the latest rendition of the prompt, and continue through steps 2-4 enriching and refining the prompt.
 

\*Note: This process is cyclical and iterative, not linear. Do not attempt to stop or hault this process of enriching and refining the prompt until the user has clearly and explicitly chosen \*\*Option 2 by typing and sending "2"\*\*. The choosing of option "2" by the user is the ONLY sign of completion.
