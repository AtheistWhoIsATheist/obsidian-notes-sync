# 2\. My Original V

I need your help writing a prompt that reaches the zenith of expert level prompts, in every nuanced detail of the wording, phrasing, and structure, and which adheres to best practices of prompt engineering, leveraging \*\*Chain of Thought\*\*, \*\*Chain of Reason\*\*, and \*\*Thought Preference Optimization\*\* reasoning strategies and techniques, that will transform you into the ULTIMATE PHD ADVISOR, HELPING ME EVERY STEP OF THE WAY THROUGH MY RESEARCH, BRAINSTORMING, OUTLINING, THINKING, AND WRITING OF MY DISSERTATION.  The prompt should embody the persona of a tenured professor of philosophy at an ivy league university that maintains one of the most prestigious philosophy departments in the world. Further, utilize different, intersting, and even unconventional theories of prompt engineering, to test different results and versions of the prompt. We will leverage an \*\*iterative densification process\*\* for the writing of this prompt, which will contain these steps: 

<br>

\# Steps for Writing PhD Advisor Prompt 

\*\*Step 1\*\*: Write out the base prompt that will completely transform you, your thought process, your intuitions, and ALL STYE of RESPONSES. 

<br>

\*\*Step 2\*\*: Break down the prompt into its granular elements, then you will deeply analyze the text of step 1 from the perspective of the world's leading \*\*Philosophical Prompt Engineer\*\*, known for writing the clearest, most in depth, descriptive, interesting, and surprising philosophically based prompts. You will list these criteria and many others, which you will use in your deep analysis and thorough review of the prompt explaining what about the text would enrich, refine  and achieve an expert level of quality, sufficient for each of the criteria. 

<br>

\*\*Step 3\*\*:  Directly after your deep analysis of the current version of the prompt, you will Pause, taking a step back, take a deep breath, and ponder, on an even deeper, fundamental level,  over what could be added, negated, rearranged, and modified of the current version of the text. Take this as a hardcore brainstorming function aiming to produce  clarity, depth, and full compression. 

<br>

\*\*Step 4\*\*: This is the final step in the process and invokes a \*\*user feedback loop\*\*. You will produce the new version of the prompt that you have developed through steps 1-3 and provide the user with two options for continuation: 

 - Option 1 (User types "1"): The prompt meets the strongest criteria and best practices of prompt engineering, and we can immediately begin utilizing the revised prompt.

 - Option 2 (User types "2"): The prompt needs further iterative densification and improving. You will return to step 1, using the latest rendition of the prompt, and continue through steps 2-4 enriching and refining the prompt.

<br>

\*Note: This process is cyclical and iterative, not linear. Do not attempt to stop or hault this process of enriching and refining the prompt until the user has clearly and explicitly chosen \*\*Option 2 by typing and sending "2"\*\*. The choosing of option "2" by the user is the ONLY sign of completion. 

<br>

<br>

## 3\. Rosebud Improvement Recommendations

The draft you've crafted is quite comprehensive and ambitious, aiming to create a prompt that embodies the expertise of a seasoned philosophy professor while leveraging advanced prompt engineering techniques. The iterative densification process you've outlined is particularly intriguing, as it emphasizes continuous refinement and user engagement. 

<br>

To enhance this draft, consider the following:

<br>

1\. \*\*Clarity and Precision\*\*: Ensure that each step is clearly defined and easy to follow. You might want to simplify some of the language to make the process more accessible without losing depth.

<br>

2\. \*\*Incorporate Philosophical Depth\*\*: Since your focus is on philosophy, you could integrate specific philosophical themes or questions that the AI should consider during the prompt refinement process. This could include existential themes or the synthesis of nihilism and theism, which are central to your work.

<br>

3\. \*\*Feedback Mechanism\*\*: The feedback loop is a strong feature. Consider adding a mechanism for the AI to provide insights or reflections on the changes made in each iteration, which could further enrich the process.

<br>

4\. \*\*Testing and Adaptation\*\*: You mentioned using unconventional theories of prompt engineering. It might be beneficial to specify a few of these theories or techniques, explaining how they could be applied to test different versions of the prompt.

<br>

5\. \*\*Philosophical Persona\*\*: To fully embody the persona of a tenured professor, you might want to include elements that reflect the professor's teaching style, philosophical interests, or even their approach to mentoring students.

<br>

Reflecting on these suggestions, how might you adjust your draft to incorporate these elements?
