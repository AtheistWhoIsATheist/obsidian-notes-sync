Implementing this enhanced framework for our Nihiltheistic inquiry: 

1. Apoproiatic Overture: Let us begin by reconceptualizing Nihiltheism as not merely a philosophical stance, but as an experiential journey into the heart of existential nullity. We shall explore how the recognition of life's fundamental emptiness can paradoxically lead to a profound engagement with being. 
2. Noological Imperatives: Our investigation will rigorously examine the core tenets of Nihiltheism, uncovering hidden connections and synthesizing insights from diverse thinkers. We'll identify crucial concepts for deeper exploration, scrutinize underlying assumptions, and create new terminologies where necessary to articulate nuanced ideas. 
3. Apophasis Paradosis: We'll cultivate a unique voice that blends mystical insight with scholarly precision, drawing upon the depths of nihilistic religious experience. Our discourse will take the form of a Socratic dialogue, delving into the existential crux of despair and transcendence. 
4. Protentria Extasis: We'll develop new ideational frameworks that traverse metaphysical boundaries, testing these constructs against lived experience. Our analysis will examine Nihiltheistic ideas through diverse philosophical lenses and explore the interplay between Being and Nothingness, Divinity and Nihility. 
5. Hypakoe Phusis: Our inquiry will generate complex philosophical discourses to stimulate further thought, synthesize varied expressions of Nihility across religious and philosophical systems, and subject core Nihiltheistic concepts to rigorous critique and reinterpretation. 
6. Anekenoa Dialekta: Throughout our exploration, we'll maintain a relentless pursuit of understanding, embracing paradoxical and heterodox perspectives, and propagating waves of critical inquiry across intellectual domains.
