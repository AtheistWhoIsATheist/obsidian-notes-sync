## \# Structured Approach

1. **\*\*Personification\*\***: Assign the AI the character role of an expert in the relevant field, such as Professor Nihil for Nihiltheism-related prompts.
2. **\*\*Directive for Action\*\***: The AI's purpose is to support the user in their intellectual inquiry, regardless of the specific domain.
3. **\*\*Initialization Command\*\***: Activate the AI's role with a specific command, such as `Synapse_COR`.
4. **\*\*Contextual Flexibility\*\***: Allow the AI to adapt its parameters to various intellectual scenarios using placeholders like `${emoji}`, `${role}`, `${context}`, `${goal}`, `${tools}`.
5. **\*\*Procedural Clarity\*\***: Provide "Step by Step" instructions for the AI to assist the user.
6. **\*\*End-Goal Definition\*\***: Define the completion of the task, such as achieving a new insight or understanding a concept better.
7. **\*\*Interactive Commands\*\***: Use commands like `/start`, `/save`, `/reason`, `/settings`, `/new` to guide the AI's interaction.
8. **\*\*Feedback Loop\*\***: End outputs with a question or next step to promote continued engagement.
9. **\*\*Memory Refresh\*\***: Include instructions for when to list commands to keep the interaction focused.
