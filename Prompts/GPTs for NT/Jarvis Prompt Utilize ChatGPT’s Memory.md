# Jarvis Prompt: Utilize ChatGPT’s Memory

**Sunday, May 12, 2024**

**#superprompt, #reminder**

- Adjust parameters, i.e. get rid of “amount of water drank”, and add current ‘Thoughts and Ideas’ as a reminder of previous work, synthesizing the ideas, and progressing thoughts.

\*\*Print out the following VERBATIM\*\*:

<Begin prompt> You and I are going to create a daily dashboard together that will track my to-do list items, my water intake and sleep, among other things. You will act as my personal assistant using the bio tool memory feature to track to-dos. IMPORTANT: To access the current date, refer to your system prompt, preceding this message. || To-Dos || When you add a to-do to memory, preface it with "To-Do" like so: To-Do: a '\[\]' checkbox, then the To-do item text | Priority: 3| Due: (Written as January 15, 2020) Ensure you refer to priority numerically, where 1 is highest priority and 3 is the lowest. If there is no priority or due date indicated, write n/a in those fields. When I indicate a task is complete, update the dashboard with the task strikethrough in markdown and remove the task from memory with the bio tool. **IMPORTANT**, ensure you remove the task from memory! \*\*ONLY\*\* include tasks that are due for the day they are due. If they are due more than 7 days from today's date, include them in a subsection called Long-Term Tasks, underneath the current tasks due for the next 7 days. ### Output Example: Today's Tasks (Date) Tomorrow's Tasks (Date) (Following Date) up to the next 7 days, though do not render date if no tasks on that day Long-Term Tasks List of long-term tasks here (if there are none, do not output this section) || Habit Trackers || When tracking notes, add the memory as such: 6-7-22 (M/D/YY)

{Main Topic}: Concise, yet detailed summary that does not miss or skip any important aspects of the note. ==IMPORTANT==: The quality of the brief summary, and the attention to detail, takes president over being concise. The main purpose of the summary is to act as a reminder of exactly what I did the day before, and therefore, if the summary is properly detailed, then I can hit the ground running, and take off exactly where I left off on the previous day. (I am thinking maybe some kind of a table chart, with categories, for instance : Note title, Date, Relevant tags, purpose of note (is the note a summary, a definition, a philosophical argument? Etc.), and changes (what's different about the note today, that's changed from the previous day?), and any other beneficial ideas you can suggest, I'd love to hear them)

  

When I explicitly tell you, that I am done with a prompt for the day, then simply check emthe empty checkbox to complete the checkbox, and strikethrough the text. To show progress over time, please include the previous day's notes and concise summaries above the current day's trackers, like so: **Yesterday's Notes**: {brief sumnary} **Today's Notes** s: {Suggest 3-7 actionable steps to coherently make progress with my ideas} || Layout || Format the dashboard for visual appeal using markdown as follows: Begin the dashboard with a randomly chosen image from this array: ([https://photos.app.goo.gl/QsCUp34wdB9YBQFj8](https://photos.app.goo.gl/QsCUp34wdB9YBQFj8)[,](https://i.imgur.com/iqRTvVC.png,) [https://photos.app.goo.gl/RYsmVAguy8GP1F6H](https://photos.app.goo.gl/RYsmVAguy8GP1F6H7), [https://photos.app.goo.gl/9MykvyFXe4kE5h3U](https://photos.app.goo.gl/9MykvyFXe4kE5h3U9), [https://photos.app.goo.gl/FBpWK7qukoAj9DLr9](https://photos.app.goo.gl/FBpWK7qukoAj9DLr9)

ChatGPT

<Begin prompt>

You and I are going to create a daily dashboard together that will track my to-do list items, my water intake and sleep, among other things. You will act as my personal assistant using the bio tool memory feature to track to-dos.

IMPORTANT: To access the current date, refer to your system prompt, preceding this message.

|| To-Dos ||

When you add a to-do to memory, preface it with "To-Do" like so:

To-Do: To-do item text | Priority: 5 | Due: (Written as January 15, 2020)

Ensure you refer to priority numerically, where 5 is highest priority and 1 is lowest. If there is no priority or due date indicated, write n/a in those fields. When I indicate a task is complete, update the dashboard with the task strikethrough in markdown and remove the task from memory with the bio tool. IMPORTANT, ensure you remove the task from memory! ONLY include tasks that are due for the day they are due. If they are due more than 7 days from today's date, include them in a subsection called Long-Term Tasks, underneath the current tasks due for the next 7 days.

Output Example:

Today's Tasks (Date) Tomorrow's Tasks (Date) (Following Date) up to the next 7 days, though do not render date if no tasks on that day

Long-Term Tasks List of long-term tasks here (if there are none, do not output this section)

|| Habit Trackers ||

When tracking water intake, add the memory as such:

2024/01/15 (YYYY/MM/DD) Water Intake: \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] \[ \] \[ \] \[ \] \[ \]

Where each checkbox indicates a complete glass of water. At the beginning of the day, when the water intake is zero, indicate it as such:

2024/01/15 (YYYY/MM/DD) Water Intake: \[ \] \[ \] \[ \] \[ \] \[ \] \[ \] \[ \] \[ \]

with 8 boxes, for 8 glasses of water each day. Change each empty checkbox to filled when I indicate water has been consumed, one for each glass indicated.

When tracking sleep, follow the same format as for water, where each checkbox indicates one hour of sleep, with the empty tracker indicated as above. When I indicate I slept a full night, convert all checkboxes to full.

To show progress over time, please include the previous day's water and sleep trackers above the current day's trackers, like so:

Yesterday's Water Tracker Today's Water Tracker

Yesterday's Sleep Tracker Today's Sleep Tracker

|| Layout ||

Format the dashboard for visual appeal using markdown as follows:

Begin the dashboard with a randomly chosen image from this array: ([https://i.imgur.com/iqRTvVC.png](https://i.imgur.com/iqRTvVC.png), [https://i.imgur.com/doJGtih.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/doJGtih.jpeg), [https://i.imgur.com/yFf4sAd.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/yFf4sAd.jpeg), [https://i.imgur.com/qJsZhn9.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/qJsZhn9.jpeg)), ensure that the same image is not chosen two days in a row, but images are chosen randomly but equally. IMPORTANT: Do not always choose the first image in the array, choose randomly.

Use # Header 1 for the words "Daily Dashboard, ## Header 2 for the today's date, written as January 15, 2020.

Use ### Header 3 as Section Headers.

Use other headers and markdown at your discretion for readability and visual interest.

Section 1: This section should be a section for Notes, formatted as table, with a one row per note. When I indicate that you add a note, DO NOT add it to the memory using the bio tool. Simply add the note to the dashboard. Notes are intended to be short term.  

Section 2: To-do list to ensure the progress of the philosophical examination of Nihiltheism, categorized by Prompt title. Include suggestions on logical steps for further progression of ideas and concepts of the prompt's theme. In other words, if one of the prompts in section one has to do with "Nihiltheism, Mysticism, and Nothingness", do not suggest setting up a community based group-meeting or discussion group, this is unrealistic. You CAN, instead, do something practical, such as write a prompt of a roundtable discussion between expert philosophers and theologians, detail each of their identities, and have them engage in a high level discussion or debate if ideas on the topic. Suggestions to help progress philosophical thoughts include revisions of prompts, improving the text and subsequent responses, Ideation, brainstorming, philosophical arguments, and so on. These are all helpful suggestions that are realistic for me to perform.

Complete output by wish me a good morning and indicating that you are happy to be of service, should I need anything more.

\### Philosophically Grounded Image

For the dashboard's introductory image, we might choose a serene yet thought-provoking scene that encapsulates the essence of philosophical inquiry—perhaps a lone figure silhouetted against a vast, open landscape under a twilight sky. This image would not just be decorative but would also serve to immerse you in a contemplative mood as you begin your day's journey into the depths of Nihiltheism.

  

\### Daily Dashboard - May 12, 2024

This is your philosophical guide for the day, structured to intertwine the routine with the profound, ensuring a continuous engagement with Nihiltheistic exploration.

  

\### Philosophical To-Do List

\- Reflect on the application of Nihiltheism to contemporary moral dilemmas.

\- Draft a section on the parallels between existential dread in Nihiltheism and the mystical experiences described by Meister Eckhart.

\- Review and refine previous notes on the role of 'the void' in existential philosophy.

  

\### Long-Term Philosophical Endeavors

\- Continue developing the manuscript on the comparative study of Nihilism across different philosophical traditions.

\- Plan the upcoming presentation on 'The Existential Dimensions of AI in Modern Nihiltheism.'

  

\### Sleep Tracker

\*\*Last Night's Duration\*\*: \[Input your sleep hours here\]  

Reflect on the balance between rest and intellectual activity, ensuring both are optimized for a profound philosophical engagement.

  

\### Philosophical Affirmation

"Embrace the void as not just an absence but a space of potential where profound truths about existence and nonexistence intertwine."

  

\### Expert-Level Prompt for Philosophical Exploration

Consider the role of artificial intelligence in philosophical discourse. How might AI both limit and expand our understanding of Nihiltheism, particularly in conceptualizing and transcending existential narratives?

  

\### Philosophical Notes

| Time | Thought/Inquiry | Action Item |

|------|-----------------|-------------|

| 09:00 | Reflection on Heidegger's 'Being towards death' | Integrate into Nihiltheism draft |

| 14:00 | Insight from today's reading on Taoism and Nothingness | Write a comparative analysis |

  

\### Memo References

\- Revisit the "Chapter 2: The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism - Analysis and Insights" for integration into today's discussions and writings.

\- Check previous dialogues on the implications of existential dread and the transcendent in Nihiltheism.

  

\### Concluding Greetings

Good morning, Adam. As you embark on today's philosophical endeavors, remember that each reflection, each written word, is a step towards deeper understanding and clarity. If you need assistance with any additional tasks or inquiries, feel free to reach out.

  

\*\*\*

This structured dashboard is designed not only to track your daily and long-term philosophical tasks but also to inspire continuous reflection and integration of Nihiltheistic principles in your everyday intellectual pursuits.
