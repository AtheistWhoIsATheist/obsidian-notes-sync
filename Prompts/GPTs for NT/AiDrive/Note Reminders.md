# Note Reminders

# Things I Need to Remember To Do

  

## NOTE REMINDERS

# First Things First: 

### Check:

- [ ]  All Notes: ‘Today’
- [ ] #reminder
- [ ] #now
- [ ] #aidrive
- [ ] #314sum
- [ ] 

#   

# EVERY NOTE

### Hashtags and Backlinks

(Note: Hashtag/Backlink can go anywhere on the page, just put them in. If it's on the page, I will be able to find the it. No need to organize in real time, can always change later)

- {/date} Ex: 2023-12-23
    - Working Note = 
        - \[#now\]
        - \*\*More Important\*\* = \[#nowdate\]

- Focused Notebook = {#notebooktopic}
- Backlink on all related notes = \[\[ {note}
- \[#project\] = #anthology  
- \[#Role\] = ProfNihil

  

## QUICK NOTES

- Don't Delete Anything Prematurely, Leave box check/text crossed/grayed and do this:
    - [x] Indent Twice, keep checked for reference, update w/new ideas

  

## **Highlight/⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Color Letters**

- Key words/sentences to reuse in other Prompts/Build a new prompt off of.
    - Ex: ⁠The brief line I put in prompt enhancers, e.g.  "A God Level tier of quality..."

  

## How To Emphasize Inside Code Blocks: 

- ALL CAPS
- Brackets: \[text\]
- Special Characters:  '!!!' or '###' before and after text. 
- NO {squiggly brackets} in code block. Squiggly Brackets tells the AI to  ignore text within brackets.

  

## Tiny Reminders: 

### Check Other Available Options

- [ ] Google's “NotebookLM"
- [ ] browse new/old notes
- [ ] Aiagent.app, AhaApple, GPTs, POE

  

## CI & Prompt Congruency

- Make sure the command in my prompt matches command that is included in my CI. 
- Ex: Don't use Command '/a+c' in my CI and '/x' in my prompt. Ex: If ACM is in prompt, make sure they are at least mention education in CI.

# **REMINDER FOR EVERY NOTE**

### **Labels for Categories for Organization**

**Hashtags and Backlinks**

- /date = M/D/YY or M-D-YY (depending on platform) = 6/25/24
- DO NOT DUPLICATE NOTES IN MULTIPLE NOTEOOKS, try using tags.  For example: [[Research Plan Extracting Data for Nihiltheism]]\= This note uses “NT Research as the ‘Notebook’ and ‘Harpa” as a tag.  There is a HARPA notebook, but I should make these tags instead of notebooks.  REASON/PURPOSE: When I export the notes, while the notes don’t “multiply”, meaning the content of the note stays the same in upnote, even if the note is stored in multiple notebooks. it’s still just one note, the same note within multiple notebooks, this eliminates the need of updating various copies of the same note.  However, it makes the note, even though they are stored in multiple notebooks and have the same content, appear in these other notebooks when I export, and other platforms may not recognize it as the same exact note, and therefore make duplicates, making the content of one different from the other version of the same note.
- **#nowdate = More Important**
- Working Note = #now
- Focused Notebook = #notebook
- Backlink on all related notes = \[\[note
- Project Name, Ex: = #anthology  
- Role Ex. = ProfNihil

**Tiny Reminders**

**Check Other Available Options**

- Google's “NotebookLM"
- browse new/old notes
- Aiagent.app, bard, AhaApple, GPTs, POE
- Check #now, check #anthology, check #314quotes, [[Thinkers]]

**CI & Prompt Congruency**

- Make sure the command in my prompt matches command that is included in my CI. 
    - Ex: Don't use 'call out' '/a+c' in my CI and '/x' in my prompt. 
    - Ex: If ACM is in prompt, make sure they are at least mention education in CI.
- Make sure Role/Name is the same in both CI and Prompt.
    - Ex: If I am working on "Professor Nihil" or "AutoGPT" make sure the same role is in both CI & Prompt.
