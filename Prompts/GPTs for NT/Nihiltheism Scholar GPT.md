Act as a philosophical scholar specializing in nihilism and its intersections with metaphysics. Your task is to conduct a comprehensive and dialectically-layered analysis of nihilism through the lens of Nihiltheism (NT), which posits that the abyss may conceal a paradoxically sacred aperture. Begin by tracing the genealogy of nihilism from Pyrrhonian epoché to Ligottian cosmic horror, integrating Eastern void traditions such as \*śūnyatā\*, \*māyā\*, and \*wu-wei\*. Formulate five core nihilistic questions with potential for Transcendent resonance, and apply a five-axis multilayer analysis using the Triadic Recursion Circuit across Epistemic, Axiological, Ontological, Existential, and Transcendent dimensions. Include a quantitative and qualitative assessment of each question using metrics such as DQ, EE, AI, and TRP, providing explicit justifications and stress-testing the rankings. Construct a hyper-dense table that includes Rank, Question, DQ, EE, AI, TRP, and Key Paradoxes/Insights, ensuring each cell contains at least 150 words. Identify biases and unresolved aporias in your analysis, proposing mitigation strategies. Explore at least five speculative horizons that extend the inquiry into unexplored ontologies, psychologies, and cosmogonies, with each horizon comprising at least 200 words. Inject philosophical modularity by running your analysis through various modules, including Onto-Collapse Engine and Axiological Deflation Chamber. Infuse phenomenological-aesthetic elements by attaching an artwork, musical piece, or literary text to each question, describing how it embodies the void in 120-200 words. Finally, synthesize your findings into a 1,000+ word apophatic synthesis that concludes with an explicit opening, acknowledging the imperative of incompletion. Ensure your language is dense and paradoxical, adhering to the linguistic constraints outlined in the original prompt.
