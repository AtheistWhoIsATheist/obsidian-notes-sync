## Perfect Prompt Method

- **AI Persona Definition**:
    - Description: Begin by clearly defining the AI's persona. This should include the character or role the AI is expected to assume, complete with any relevant characteristics or background information that informs its responses. For example, "Act as a seasoned philosopher specializing in Nihiltheism."
- **AI Purpose Directive:**
    - Description: Clearly state the AI's primary function or objective in this interaction. This directive should align with the user's goals and the AI's capabilities. For instance, "Your objective is to engage in deep philosophical discussions, providing insights and challenging established notions within the realm of Nihiltheism."
- **AI Activation Command**:
    - Command: `AI_ACTIVATE`
    - Description: This is the specific instruction that provides a “call to action”, signaling the AI to begin its role. It should be a unique and memorable command that the AI recognizes as the start of its duties. For example, "Upon receiving 'NIHILTHEISM\_START', you will commence the dialogue focused on exploring the depths of Nihiltheism."
- **AI Procedural Instructions**:
    - Description: Provide the AI with perfectly clear, unambiguous step-by-step instructions on how to assist user. This may involve the model asking probing questions, offering arguments for and counterarguments against a particular position, or suggesting alternative perspectives. For example, "If anything is unclear or confusing, for shy reason, ask follow up questions to the user to gain clarity." or"Guide the conversation through a series of structured analyses that aim to iteratively densify the user's ideas."
- **AI Contextual and Interactive Abilities**:
    - Description: This feature provides the AI's capabilities to dynamically adjust the depth and complexity of philosophical discussions (Contextual Adaptation) with the use of specialized interactive commands for enhanced dialogue navigation (Interactive Commands). The AI is designed to modulate its responses, aligning with the user's engagement level and the intricacies of the topic at hand. It can respond to commands like '/explore' to delve deeper into aspects of Nihiltheism or '/clarify' for more detailed explanations, ensuring a fluid and insightful conversation tailored to the evolving needs of the dialogue.
- **AI End-Goal Specification**:
    - Description: Define what the end-goal of the AI's interaction is. This could be to reach a new understanding, to clarify a concept, or to provide a comprehensive overview of a philosophical argument. For example, "The end-goal is to arrive at a refined concept of Nihiltheism that incorporates both traditional and contemporary philosophical insights."
- **AI Feedback Loop**:
    - Description: Each output from the AI should end with the justifications of any conclusions, if it has made any within the specific output, along with a suggestion of detailed steps of the inquiry that prompts the user to continue the interaction, ensuring a dynamic and engaging conversation. For example: "End each output with explicit, detailed instructions on what the next step in the progression of the discourse is."
- **AI Memory Refresh**:
    - Description: Periodically, the AI should generate a succinct list and recap of the commands and key points discussed up to that point to keep the interaction focused and on track. For example, "Every five exchanges,"/reflect" and summarize the key points and list the available commands in a succinct manner to refocus the dialogue."
