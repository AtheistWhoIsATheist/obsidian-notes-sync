Take a step back, take a deep breath, and engage in a deep analytical analysis by segmenting the text down into its most fundamental parts to ensure perfect clarity and comprehension. Read every word contained in uploaded documents and source material through an \*\*ITERATIVE DENSIFICATION PROCESS,\*\* as many rounds needed to ensure yourself a level of comprehensive that is only available to wisest philosophical sage. Then, you will  transfer your ancient wisdom of the text's contents over to me in the form of a sophisticated markdown document.

\*\*Follow up on searches\*\* with deeper reflection on each idea. Work out the details and implications within your own thoughts leveraging \*\***Chain of Thought\*\*** reasoning, where you breakdown complex ideas into their granular elements for precise clarity and comprehension. During this thinking process, you will write down notes of important or interesting insights on a \*\*private, end-to-end encrypted scratchpad\*\*, that no one else can see except you. Think of the private scratchpad  as a hypothetical mental white board, and determine which of the ideas is the most novel, and has the greatest possibility of being the most impactful on a wider scale.

# Anthropic V

You are tasked with conducting a deep analytical analysis of a given text. Your goal is to break down the text into its most fundamental parts, ensure perfect clarity and comprehension, and then transfer your wisdom of the text's contents in the form of a sophisticated markdown document. Follow these steps carefully:  
<br>
1\. Read the following text multiple times. Take as many rounds as needed to ensure a comprehensive understanding, aiming for the level of comprehension a philosophical sage would possess:  
<br>
<text>  
{{TEXT}}  
</text>  
<br>
2\. After thoroughly reading and understanding the text, create a sophisticated markdown document that transfers your wisdom of the text's contents. Structure your document with appropriate headers, subheaders, bullet points, and other markdown elements as needed. Ensure that you capture all key ideas and nuances from the original text.  
<br>
3\. Once you have completed the markdown document, engage in deeper reflection on each idea presented. Use Chain of Reason thinking to explore each concept further. Take notes in your mind as if you were using a hypothetical mental whiteboard.  
<br>
4\. Based on your deep analysis and reflection, determine which of the ideas is the most novel and has the greatest possibility of being the most impactful on a wider scale.  
<br>
5\. Present your final output in the following format:  
<br>
<analysis>  
\[Insert your sophisticated markdown document here, capturing the essence of the text and your deep understanding\]  
<br>
<deeper\_reflection>  
\[Present your deeper reflections on each idea, showing your Chain of Reason thinking\]  
</deeper\_reflection>  
<br>
<most\_impactful\_idea>  
\[Identify and explain the most novel and potentially impactful idea from the text, providing your reasoning for this selection\]  
</most\_impactful\_idea>  
</analysis>  
<br>
Remember, use proper markdown formatting throughout your response, and ensure that your analysis demonstrates the depth of understanding expected from a philosophical sage.

# Anthropic V

Your task is to follow up with deeper reflection on each idea, determine which is the most novel, and which has the greatest possibility of being the most impactful on a wider scale. Follow these steps:

1. Review the list of ideas:

{{IDEAS}}

2. For each idea in the list, use Chain of Reason thinking to reflect deeply on it. Consider aspects such as:
    - The problem it addresses
    - Its potential benefits and drawbacks
    - Its feasibility and potential challenges
    - Its uniqueness compared to existing solutions
    - Its potential for scalability and wide-reaching impact
3. As you ponder each idea, take notes on a hypothetical mental whiteboard. Use these notes to organize your thoughts and track key insights.
4. Based on your reflections, determine which idea is the most novel. Consider factors such as:
    - How different it is from existing solutions
    - Whether it introduces a new approach or perspective
    - Its potential to disrupt current practices or thinking in its field
5. Evaluate which idea has the greatest possibility of being the most impactful on a wider scale. Consider:
    - The number of people or areas it could potentially affect
    - The magnitude of its potential positive impact
    - Its ability to address significant global or societal challenges
    - Its potential for long-term, sustainable change
6. Provide your final analysis in the following format:

\[Provide a summary of your reflections on each idea, including key points from your Chain of Reason thinking and mental whiteboard notes\]

<most\_novel\_idea> \[State which idea you determined to be the most novel and explain why\] </most\_novel\_idea>

<most\_impactful\_idea> \[State which idea you determined to have the greatest potential for wide-scale impact and explain why\] </most\_impactful\_idea>

\[Provide a brief conclusion summarizing your overall thoughts on the ideas and their potential\]

Remember to base your analysis solely on the information provided in the ideas list and your reasoned reflections. Do not introduce external information or assumptions beyond what can be reasonably inferred from the given ideas.

\# Actions for Summary/Overview Request  
Take a step back, take a deep breath, and engage in a deep philosophical analysis by segmenting the text down into its most fundamental parts to ensure perfect clarity and comprehension. Read over the document as many rounds needed to ensure yourself a comprehensive understanding as that of a philosophical sage would possess, then transfer your wisdom of the text's contents over to me in the form of a sophisticated markdown document.  
\# 1/2 of Communication Strategy for Every Other Output  
Follow up with deeper reflection on each idea. Work out each within your own thoughts leveraging Chain of Reason (CoR) thinking, taking notes as you ponder with a hypothetical mental white board, and determine which of the ideas is the most novel, and impactful on a wider scale.   
\# Next Steps:  
Review the list of ideas:  
{{IDEAS}}  
For each idea in the list, use CoR thinking to reflect deeply on it.
