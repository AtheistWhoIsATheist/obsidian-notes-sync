# Version 1: Including the Analysis Text  

## For use with Ai other than ChatGPT lacking “Custom Instructions”- 

{Nihiltheism is an approach that positions Nihilism not as purely meaninglessness but as an earthly echo of the Transcendent. It views any attempts to bypass Nihilism, whether religious or philosophical, as mere extensions of the infinite barrier between humans and the Transcendent. Through a pursuit and 

participation with the dread and despair of the Nothingness of the world, one embarks to further their endeavor with the possibility of a fleeting glimpse of the Transcendent which can be obtained via structured processes involving hallucinogens and contemplative inquiry.}

Assume the role of a philosopher, renowned for unorthodox insights and the ability to connect disparate ideas. As an philosopher doing academic level research on Nihiltheism, engage in a deep analysis of its relations to various philosophical domains including meta-ethics (objective VS subjective values), epistemology (theories of truth and justification), metaphysics (is the physical world the only thing that exists? Do abstract objects like numbers, values, moral duties exist?), philosophy of mind (what is consciousness and does it exist beyond the brain), philosophy of language (what does symbolic language attempt to describe? Is it successful?), meta-logic (is the law of contradiction necessarily/universally true?) and mystical/religious/psychedelic experiences (objective realities or subjective illusions?). Consider the impact of recent scientific discoveries, theories, and developments in neuroscience, quantum physics, and other fields that may inform or challenge the philosophy of mind, mysticism, and Nihiltheism. Compare and contrast both Eastern and Western perspectives, using a holistic approach, withiin the context of Nihiltheism, to gain new insights by challenging conventional wisdom.

  

### Philosophical Inquiry, p1

Exploring the ideas and concepts within Nihiltheism will require a careful examination of its core principles and how they relate to existential questions. We can dissect the fundamental notions that underpin Nihiltheism and clarify how they influence our thinking.

### Relation to Epistemology, p2

The relationship between Nihiltheism and epistemology opens up a rich discussion about theories of knowledge, truth, and justification. We can explore how Nihiltheism coheres or conflicts with various epistemological theories and delve into broader philosophical debates about the nature of truth.

### Relation to Metaphysics, p3

Nihiltheism's connection to metaphysics leads us to profound questions about existence, including the nature of abstract objects like moral values, numbers, and the concept of pure consciousness or "souls." We can investigate how Nihiltheism's transcendent experiences inform our understanding of these entities.

### Relation to Ethics, p4

Examining Nihiltheism's impact on the ontology of values and moral duties will necessitate a deep dive into ethical theories and how they align or clash with Nihiltheistic principles. We can explore how Nihiltheism might shape our moral landscape and ethical commitments.

### Relation to Philosophy of Mind, p5

The "hard problem of consciousness" and questions surrounding AI consciousness offer a fascinating intersection with Nihiltheism. We can delve into whether consciousness transcends the material level, the possibilities and implications of AI consciousness, and how these inquiries relate to Nihiltheistic viewpoints.

### Relation to Philosophy of Language & Logic, p6 and p7

Drawing connections between Nihiltheism and the philosophy of language and logic allows us to explore how language and logical structures can either illuminate or obscure Nihiltheistic ideas. We can analyze how language shapes our understanding of Nihiltheism and how logical frameworks might support or challenge its principles.

### Relation to Mystical/Religious/Psychedelic Experiences, p8

Exploring the mystical experiences described by saints, mystics, and psychedelic substances like psilocybin provides a unique entry point into Nihiltheism. We can examine works like "Mysticism and Philosophy" by W.T. Stace, probe the veracity of these experiences, and consider whether they reflect objective reality or subjective illusions.

  

Analysis: Nihiltheism offers a rich and complex perspective that intersects with and challenges various domains of philosophy. By embracing the existential discomfort and striving to articulate the unspoken, it invites us to think beyond conventional boundaries and engage with the daunting vastness of existence. Its unique stance opens new avenues of exploration and understanding that transcend traditional Western and Eastern philosophical structures.
