Please create a comprehensive, clear, and organized set of notes based on the provided resources. Utilize an intensive iterative densification protocol to ensure that all key terms, concepts, nuances, and practical examples are included and granularly detailed with surgical precision. The notes should cover definitions, detailed explanations, principles, all key entities, every important aspect, and all related examples. The notes should be structured logically with headings and subheadings to enhance readability. Include detailed explanations of key terms, principles, and examples to illustrate complex ideas. Aim for rigorous clarity, precision, and depth to help in understanding the material thoroughly.
