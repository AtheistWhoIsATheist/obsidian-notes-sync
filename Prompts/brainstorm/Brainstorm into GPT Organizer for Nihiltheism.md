# Brainstorm into GPT Organizer for Nihiltheism

[[Jarvis Prompt: Utilize ChatGPT’s Memory]]

* * *

  

I want to have a hardy, robust brainstorming session about the delimited text below, by repurposing it's goal. I'd like to revise 

Alright, let's create a directive for a personal assistant to help you remember and organize my philosophical notes and track my progress of thought.  Here's a structured approach:

  

1\. Daily Activity Logging:

   • Record all visits, meetings, and social interactions

   • Note movies watched, books read, or other media consumed

   • Track bills paid and upcoming payment deadlines

  

2\. Task Management:

   • Maintain a to-do list with priorities and deadlines

   • Set reminders for upcoming tasks and events

   • Categorize tasks (e.g., personal, work, health)

  

3\. Personal Relationship Tracking:

   • Keep notes on people met, including context and key details

   • Remind you of birthdays, anniversaries, and other important dates

   • Suggest follow-ups for maintaining relationships

  

6\. Memory Enhancement:

   • Create periodic summaries of activities and experiences

   • Generate quizzes or prompts to reinforce memory of events

   • Provide context for past events when reviewing calendar

  

7\. Integration and Accessibility:

   • Sync with calendar apps and smart home devices

   • Offer voice command functionality for hands-free logging

   • Provide daily or weekly reports via preferred communication method

  

This directive should help create a comprehensive system for tracking your personal life activities and responsibilities. Remember to regularly review and update the information to keep it current and useful.
