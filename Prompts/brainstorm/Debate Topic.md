\### Opening Statements

  

\#### \*\*Prof. A (Theistic Mysticism)\*\*

  

\*\*Prof. A:\*\*  

Thank you. The mystic traditions within Christianity, and indeed across many world religions, provide profound insights into the nature of the divine. Mystics such as Meister Eckhart and Teresa of Avila describe encounters with a transcendent God who is both immanent and personal. These experiences are marked by an overwhelming sense of union with the divine—a union that transcends the intellect and draws the soul into the very life of God.

  

Mystical experiences, while ineffable, consistently point to a reality that is more than mere Nothingness. They reveal a God who is love, who is light, and who desires a relationship with creation. This is not a void but a fullness—a pleroma—that surpasses all understanding. Mystical theology argues that God is the ultimate source of all being, and these experiences are glimpses of this ultimate reality.

  

I will argue that these experiences, rooted in centuries of tradition and contemplation, provide compelling evidence for the existence of a personal, transcendent God. They show that the divine is not an abstract Nothingness but a living reality, a presence that can be encountered and experienced deeply by the soul. The transformative effects of these experiences—marked by profound love, humility, and a sense of oneness with all creation—further attest to their authenticity and the truth of the God they reveal.

  

\### \*\*Nihiltheist\*\*

  

\*\*Nihiltheist:\*\*  

Thank you. Nihiltheism approaches the divine from a fundamentally different perspective. Where traditional mysticism sees union with a personal God, Nihiltheism suggests that the most profound spiritual experience is not one of union with a being, but of an encounter with Nothingness—an absolute void that underlies all existence. 

  

This Nothingness is not merely the absence of something, but a presence in its own right—a transcendent reality that defies the categories of being and non-being. Nihiltheism posits that the true nature of the divine, if it can be called that, is found in the dissolution of all meaning, all identity, and all constructs. It is a radical deconstruction of the self and the world, leading to a direct confrontation with the void.

  

In this framework, the experience of Nothingness is not a negation but a revelation—a stripping away of illusions to reveal the ultimate ground of reality. This experience can be deeply unsettling, but it is also liberating. It challenges the very foundations of our existence, forcing us to confront the possibility that all meaning is contingent, and that the only true reality is the void.

  

Nihiltheism argues that this Nothingness is the closest we can come to the divine. It is a transcendent experience that, paradoxically, offers a form of spiritual fulfillment—not through union with a deity, but through the acceptance of the void as the ultimate reality.

  

\### Main Arguments

  

\#### \*\*Prof. A (Theistic Mysticism)\*\*

  

\*\*Prof. A:\*\*  

The tradition of mystical theology, particularly within Christianity, offers a rich and varied account of encounters with the divine that are far from nihilistic. These experiences, as recorded by figures such as John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila, involve not the dissolution into a void, but a union with a personal God who is the source of all being and love.

  

These mystical experiences are transformative. They lead to a radical change in the individual, characterized by a profound sense of peace, love, and compassion for others. This transformation is not merely psychological but ontological—it affects the very being of the mystic, drawing them closer to the divine essence, which is love itself.

  

Moreover, these experiences are consistent across cultures and religious traditions. Whether in the Christian mysticism of the Middle Ages, the Sufi mysticism of Islam, or the contemplative practices of Buddhism and Hinduism, we find a common thread: the experience of a transcendent, personal reality that is both immanent and beyond comprehension.

  

This consistency suggests that these experiences are not merely subjective or culturally contingent but point to a deeper, objective reality—a divine presence that permeates all of existence. The God encountered in these experiences is not an abstraction or a void but a living, loving reality that desires communion with creation.

  

\### \*\*Nihiltheist\*\*

  

\*\*Nihiltheist:\*\*  

While the mystical experiences described by traditional theists are indeed profound, Nihiltheism challenges the assumption that these experiences point to a personal, loving God. Instead, Nihiltheism interprets these experiences as encounters with the underlying void of existence—an experience that strips away all illusions of self, meaning, and even the divine as traditionally conceived.

  

The transformation described by mystics can also be understood through the lens of Nihiltheism. The dissolution of the self, often experienced as union with the divine, can be reinterpreted as an encounter with Nothingness—a realization that the self is an illusion, and that all constructs of meaning, including the concept of God, are ultimately groundless.

  

This does not negate the profundity of these experiences. On the contrary, it amplifies them by acknowledging the radical emptiness at their core. The peace and love reported by mystics can be seen as a response to the acceptance of this Nothingness—a surrender to the void that transcends the need for meaning or identity.

  

Nihiltheism argues that this void is the true nature of the divine—a transcendent Nothingness that underlies all existence. The divine is not a being among beings, not even the highest being, but the very ground of being itself, which is Nothingness. This view challenges the traditional theistic interpretation of mystical experiences, suggesting instead that these experiences point to a reality beyond all dualities, including the duality of being and non-being.

  

\### Rebuttals

  

\#### \*\*Prof. A (Theistic Mysticism)\*\*

  

\*\*Prof. A:\*\*  

The Nihiltheistic interpretation of mystical experiences as encounters with Nothingness risks undermining the very essence of what these experiences reveal. The profound sense of love, unity, and purpose reported by mystics across traditions cannot simply be reduced to a confrontation with the void. To do so is to strip these experiences of their transformative power and their ability to reveal a reality that is fundamentally positive, life-affirming, and relational.

  

Furthermore, the concept of Nothingness, as presented by Nihiltheism, raises a critical question: If Nothingness is the ultimate reality, why do mystics experience it as a presence filled with love, compassion, and meaning? If the divine is truly Nothingness, how do we account for the consistent reports of a loving, personal God encountered in these mystical states?

  

These experiences point not to an absence, but to a fullness—a presence that transcends our understanding but is nonetheless experienced as real and loving. The void, as described by Nihiltheism, lacks the relational and personal aspects that are central to theistic mysticism. It is through this personal encounter with the divine that mystics are transformed, not through a surrender to Nothingness.

  

\#### \*\*Nihiltheist\*\*

  

\*\*Nihiltheist:\*\*  

The Nihiltheistic perspective does not deny the transformative power of mystical experiences but offers a reinterpretation that aligns with the profound existential realities these experiences often entail. The peace and love experienced by mystics can indeed be powerful, but Nihiltheism suggests that these are the result of surrendering to the void, rather than encountering a personal, relational deity.

  

Nihiltheism argues that the concept of a loving, personal God is itself a construct—a comforting narrative that helps individuals make sense of their mystical experiences. However, when we strip away these narratives, we are left with the raw, unmediated encounter with Nothingness. This Nothingness, while unsettling, is the true ground of being—the ultimate reality that transcends all human categories, including those of love and personhood.

  

Mystical experiences, when examined without the lens of traditional theism, reveal a deeper truth: the dissolution of the self into the void, the recognition of the contingency of all meanings, and the acceptance of the radical freedom that comes from embracing Nothingness. The love and unity experienced by mystics can be understood as a response to this encounter with the void—a form of existential acceptance and liberation, rather than evidence of a personal God.

  

\### Dialogue

  

\*\*Prof. A:\*\*  

You seem to suggest that the mystical experience is essentially an encounter with Nothingness, and that the concepts of love and unity are merely responses to this void. But isn’t this interpretation overly reductive? When mystics speak of love, they are not speaking of an abstract idea but of a profound, relational experience. How do you reconcile this with your notion of Nothingness?

  

\*\*Nihiltheist:\*\*  

The experience of love, as described by mystics, can indeed be profound. However, Nihiltheism proposes that this love arises not from a relational God but from the dissolution of the self into the void. The love and unity experienced are not directed towards a being but are manifestations of the recognition that all distinctions, including the self, are illusory. In this view, love is the experience of non-duality—the realization that there is no separation, no self, no other, only the void.

  

\*\*Prof. A:\*\*  

But if there is no self, no other, and only the void, how do we account for the ethical and moral implications of these experiences? Mystics often emerge from their encounters with a deepened sense of compassion and responsibility towards others. How does Nihiltheism address the ethical dimension of these experiences if everything is ultimately Nothingness?

  

\*\*Nihiltheist:\*\*  

Nihiltheism acknowledges that the recognition of Nothingness can lead to a profound ethical stance. When one realizes that all constructs, including the self, are groundless, it can foster a deep sense of humility and compassion. This is not because of a divine command or relationship but because the realization of Nothingness dissolves the barriers that create conflict and suffering. The ethical response in Nihiltheism is one of radical acceptance and non-attachment—an engagement with the world that is compassionate, yet free from the illusions of meaning and self.

  

\*\*Prof. A:\*\*  

Yet, this seems to lead to a form of ethical relativism. If all meanings and values are groundless, how can we claim any moral stance as valid? Doesn’t this lead to a form of existential despair rather than liberation?

  

\*\*Nihiltheist:\*\*  

Nihiltheism does not advocate for despair, but rather for an embrace of the freedom that comes from recognizing the void. This freedom allows for the creation of meaning and values in a way that is fully conscious of their contingency. Ethical action, in this framework, is not dictated by an external moral law but emerges from an authentic engagement with the reality of Nothingness. It is an ethics of presence—of being fully aware of the void and yet choosing to act  with compassion and integrity in the face of it.

  

\### Closing Statements

  

\#### \*\*Prof. A (Theistic Mysticism)\*\*

  

\*\*Prof. A:\*\*  

Mystical experiences offer a profound and transformative encounter with the divine—a divine that is not an abstract Nothingness but a living, loving presence that desires communion with creation. The consistent testimony of mystics across traditions points to a reality that transcends mere Nothingness, offering a fullness that can only be described as divine. While the Nihiltheist perspective offers a challenging critique, it ultimately fails to account for the relational and personal dimensions of these experiences, which are central to their transformative power. The divine is not an empty void, but the ground of all being, love, and meaning.

  

\#### \*\*Nihiltheist\*\*

  

\*\*Nihiltheist:\*\*  

Nihiltheism challenges us to look beyond the comforting narratives of traditional theism and to confront the raw reality of Nothingness. This encounter with the void, far from being despairing, offers a radical form of liberation—freeing us from the illusions of self, meaning, and even the divine as traditionally conceived. The experience of Nothingness is not a negation but a revelation—a glimpse into the ultimate nature of reality, which is beyond all concepts and categories. In embracing the void, we discover a deeper form of transcendence—one that is not rooted in being but in the profound mystery of Nothingness itself.
