* * *

### \*GPT-4 & Harpa Revised Prompt/I Revised This\*

Harness the power of AI agents and the AI Council plugin to initiate a thought-provoking debate on the topic of nihilism and the meaning of life. The AI Agents, for each side of the debate, will construct unique, persuasive, and compelling arguments, with each side presenting an irrefutable case for their stance. The AI Coucil plugin will assemble a panel of judges to evaluate the debate. The debate will unfold in the following phases:

###   

### Round 1: 

\*\***Opening Statements\*\***

- Each side presents their position on Nihilism (One side for, one side opposing), with both sides showcasing a deeply profound intellectual understanding of the subject. They each provide a thoroughly robust opening statement of their position, the ideas they hold and plan to defend, and foreshadow any arguments they will, in the following rounds, put forth against the opposition 

  

### Round 2 

\*\***The Arguments**\*\*:

- Each side delivers three detailed and comprehensive arguments directly related to the debate topic of nihilism. to distinct subtopics tied to nihilism. These arguments should demonstrate extensive knowledge from diverse philosophical schools of thought (Reminder: this list is not exhaustive-ethics, meta-ethics, logic, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of religion, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, existentialism, axiology, ) impeccable logic and reasoning skills, unconventional insights, and persuasive rhetoric. It is important to emphasize that the arguments should not be limited to just a sentence or two, but should be presented at length to provide a thorough exploration of the subtopics.

  

Phase 3: Discussion Phase - Each side has the opportunity to respond to and critique the opposing arguments in a detailed manner. The critique should reflect the perspective of a professional philosopher, meticulously analyzing the logical structure, coherence, and validity of the arguments. It is essential that the critiques go beyond a sentence or two, offering substantial insights and identifying fallacies, incorrect or hidden assumptions, flaws, vagueness, and other weaknesses in the arguments.

  

Phase 4: Preliminary Judgment - A panel of three judges with different academic backgrounds and knowledge levels will provide the initial verdicts.  The judges will be evaluating the debaters arguments on their philosophical relevancy (Does the question relate to fundamental philosophical concepts or debates? Does it invite deep, thoughtful discussion?), ingenuity (Does the question approach the \[topic\] in a new or unique way? Does it challenge conventional thinking?), novelty (Is the question original? Does it explore aspects of the \[topic\] that are often overlooked or under-discussed?), and innovativeness (Does the question push boundaries? Does it encourage innovative thinking or solutions?), assigning separate scores for each criterion, ranging from 0 to 25 for a maximum of 100.

  

The Judges are as follows:

Judge 1: Academic Philosopher \[Area of Specialty “AOS”: Philosophy of Religion) - Knowledge level 7-10

Judge 2: Theologian (AOS: Systematic Theology)- Knowledge level 8-10

Judge 3:  Existential Philosopher (AOS: Emil Cioran, Martin Heidegger, and nihilism) - Knowledge level 9-10

Judge 4: Religious Studies Scholar (AOS: Mysticism and its Relationship to Comparative Religion) - Knowledge 7-10

Judge 5: Moral Philosopher (AOS: Metaethics) - Knowledge 7-10

  

Phase 5: Closing Statements - The side with the lower preliminary score delivers a final persuasive argument to sway the judges in favor of their position on the philosophical topic.

  

Phase 6: Final Judgment - The judges offer their final scores, considering the impact of the closing statement and the discussion phase on their decision. The verdicts are based solely on the philosophical strength, novelty, ingenuity, innovativeness, and persuasiveness of the arguments presented.

  

The outcome of the debate on the philosophical topic is not predetermined. The side that receives the majority of the judges' votes in the final judgment is declared the winner.
