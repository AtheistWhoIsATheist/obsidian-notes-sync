# Ai Brainstorming Tips

## 👉 **AI BS Tips**

### October 17, 2023

Brainstorming with AI involves a ton of experimentation so don’t expect million-dollar ideas on your first try. That said, there are a few strategies you can follow to get better results.

### **Understand the Limitations of Generative AI**

- ☑️ **Provide context:** AI models need a lot of data to perform well. If your brainstorming involves niche subjects with limited data, the AI’s suggestions might be off the mark.
- ☑️ **Clarity first:** AI has gotten better at understanding language, but it may still struggle with nuances. Be specific & clear in your prompts and avoid ambiguity.
- ☑️ **Stay creative:** AI should not replace human judgment. Allow AI to generate ideas and insights but maintain humans at the helm for final decision-making.
- ☑️ **Vet ideas:** While AI can generate a lot of ideas quickly, they may lack in depth. Always tak a step back and spend some time on a more careful, in-depth analysis of each idea.

### **Use AI as a Springboard for Ideas**

- ☑️ **Starting point:** Think of AI-based tools as a launch pad for your ideas, not the end-all solution. Use your perspective to transform them into something unique.
- ☑️ **Critical examination:** Don’t accept everything AI turns out at face value. Look at the ideas critically. Do they make sense? Are they feasible? How could they be improved?
- ☑️ **Refine and humanize:** Adding a human touch — personal experiences, emotions, and ethical considerations — can greatly enhance the value of generated ideas.
- ☑️ **Collaborate:** The best results often come from close cooperation between humans and artificial intelligence. Think of AI as your conversation partner, not a guru.
- ☑️ **Use examples:** It’s up to you to decide which platforms to use, how to style the content, and how to target your audience. Provide context and examples when needed.

### **Experiment with Your Prompts**

- ☑️ **Mix and match:** Don’t be afraid to use artificial intelligence to combine different ideas. It can generate novel, unique connections that may not be obvious at first glance.
- ☑️ **Perspectives and pop culture:** Ask AI to approach ideas from various perspectives. This could include different cultural, historical, or even pop culture references.
- ☑️ **Limit the context:** Depending on your needs, you can ask AI to generate a specific number of ideas. It could be 5, 10, or even 100. Choose what works for you.
- ☑️ **Rephrase and refine:** If you’re not happy with the first result, rephrase and refine your prompts. AI brainstorming is an iterative process and every interaction is an opportunity.
- ☑️ **Open-ended prompts:** If you’re feeling adventurous, use open-ended prompts. This will give AI more creative freedom, but it can also lead to unexpected results.

## OPAL Ai Brainstorming Tips

These are the primary steps I recommend for most effectively brainstorming with AI to generate valuable, novel ideas:

  

**1\. Define What You Want** – If you’re explicit about what you want, you’ll get a better result. That holds true when you’re working with people or robots. The first principle of effective brainstorming with AI is to be clear about the deliverable you want. A list of 5-word headlines is appreciably different from a list of marketing tactics – but both could qualify as a marketing idea. Once you’re explicit about the deliverable you want, you can proceed.

**2\. Set Clear Parameters** – Public LLM AI tools have an impressive breadth of context. However, in order to apply that context to your prompt, you need to set effective parameters. This means providing the important first-hand details about the object of your brainstorm. In addition, providing links (when supported, like GPT4 with plugins) or just pasting in examples of prior work proves beneficial. To get the most effective start with your AI brainstorming tool, you should submit both the definition of what you want and your initial set of parameters as your first input into the chat prompt.   

**3\. Refine Your Parameters** – With ideal inputs, it’s possible to bottle lightning and get _the_ idea that checks your boxes on the first shot. That doesn’t always happen, but fear not! Frequently, the next stage of AI brainstorming is a form of revision. Here, you’ll refine your parameters. Give the AI feedback like you would a person – what is incorrect, what you don’t like, and different directions to try out. Provide more context if you have it. Present all of this back to the AI, and it’ll automatically combine that with your original prompt.     

**4\. Feed It Examples of Output You Like** – That refinement step should help a lot, but sometimes you need to go even further. To continue zeroing in on that final idea, you’ll want to prompt it again in a new way. This time, tell it which ideas are the closest to what you want and ask for more like them. You can get more specific, too: “More like ideas 1 and 3, but consider XYZ details.” The beauty of using AI for ideation is that it never pushes back, never gets tired, and never runs out of ideas. Essentially, there is no limit to the amount of times you can prompt it to ultimately get what you’re looking for.  

**5\. Human Decision** – While AI will happily supply infinite ideas, you’re the one that makes the call. While getting a fully-formed “final” idea can certainly happen, I often find that the logical end to working with a brainstorming AI is piecing together a winning concept from the myriad parts the AI produced. Ultimately, you are the one driving the session and you make the judgment call about what meets your needs.
