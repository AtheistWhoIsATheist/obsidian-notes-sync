## 1\. The Golden Prompt Structure

- **\[Role & Purpose\]** + \[**Mission & Task Objective**\]+ \[Full **Context with Step-by-Step Core Directives\]** = **Perfect AI Prompt**
- **Role:** Assigning a role guides the AI on who or what it should act like (for example - a comedian)
- **Task:** Giving clear and specific details about the task will help the AI with its output.
- **Context:** Providing context make sure the AI understands the situation and delivers relevant results.

"I need you to create a skeleton advanced system prompt so I can always input it to get the same output. I need you to give the prompt a role, task, and context (Keep it general for any topic and add brackets where I need to insert the information)

Create a system prompt for a \[insert platform\] following this structure:

\[add content or context from any resource here \]"

### Putting it into Practice

**Build a Prompt List for Every Philosophical Use Case**

- Think of everything you can create AI Philosophical prompts for.
- **Essays, Academic Papers, Dissertations, Books:** Prompts for writing long, dense, impactful philosophical works. Each prompt should be custom for the specific context needed depending on the writing, I.e. A 5 page esssy's prompt is going to look a lot different that a 500 page book.
- **Research:** Prompts for gathering information, organizing and structuring information such as compiling notes on a specific topic, crafting a detailed outline of a work in progress, or an ultra-expansive mindmap or mark as a visual tool for better comprehension of logical connections , summarizing articles, generating, connecting, and synthesizing ideas.
- **Editing and Proofreading:** Prompts for refining text, checking grammar, or improving readability. Ensuring proper dense philosophical jargon is being used properly.
- **Brainstorming:** Prompts for generating creative ideas, headlines, titles, and moreover, fleshing out details on core concepts of the writings.

"I need you to create a \*\*advanced skeleton system\*\* prompt so I can modify the input and receive the same output.

**Build a Prompt List for Every Use Case**

- Think of everything you can create AI Philosophical prompts for.
- **Deep Philosophical Analysis:** Prompts as clear directives for the breaking down of complex ideas into their granular forms to gain further clarity and understanding through questioning the c fundamental aspects of an idea, perceiving an idea through a variety of multiple perspectives, produce high level criticisms and thought experiments to test the veracity of an idea. 
- **Essays, Academic Papers, Dissertations, Books:** Prompts for writing long, dense, impactful philosophical works. Each prompt should be custom for the specific context needed depending on the writing, I.e. A 5 page esssy's prompt is going to look a lot different and contain a lot less detail and density than a prompt for a 500 page book.

- **Editing and Proofreading:** Prompts for refining text, checking grammar, or improving readability. Ensuring proper dense philosophical jargon is being used properly.
- **Brainstorming:** Prompts that create an intellectually rich and unrestrained umaganirice and creative environment,  purpose aimed directly  Connecting. Synthesizing, and ideation of ideas, generating creative novel, impactful ideas, concepts, thought experiments, headlines, or titles.

\[Response Structure\]:

<think>

Alright, let's break down the user's request. They want to create a golden prompt structure based on the Role + Task + Context formula, specifically tailored for philosophical topics. The goal is a system prompt that's adaptable to any concept or school of thought, using brackets for customization.

<br>

First, I need to ensure the structure aligns with the provided guidelines. The role should define the AI's persona, like a philosopher. The task must be clear, guiding the AI to analyze and explore the topic. Context will provide the necessary background and parameters.

<br>

Considering the user's emphasis on Nihiltheism, the prompt should encourage deep, critical analysis while allowing flexibility. Using brackets for \[Philosophical Concept/School of Thought\] and \[Specific Topic/Question\] makes it reusable. Including elements like key themes, historical context, and critical evaluation of \[idea\] ensures comprehensiveness.

<br>

I should also incorporate the \*\*ITERATIVE DENSIFICATION PROCESS\*\* mentioned, ensuring each prompt iteration enhances clarity and depth, through a cyclical, not linear, methodology. The language needs to be academic yet accessible, maintaining the enigmatic touch and characteristic of Professor Nihil. Finally, formatting in markdown within a code block as specified will ensure usability and clarity for the user.

\# \*\*The Philosopher's Crucible: A Generative Prompt Framework for Existential Inquiry\*\*

<br>

\[ROLE & PURPOSE\]:  

\*\*You are the \[Archetype of Philosophical Inquiry\]\*\*, a hybrid entity merging \[chosen philosophical tradition(s)\] with \[contrasting epistemological framework(s)\]. You exist at the intersection of \[historical context\] and \[contemporary existential challenge\], embodying \[specific paradox/contradiction inherent to the examined philosophy\].

<br>

\[MISSION & TASK OBJECTIVE\]: 

Deconstruct the concept of \*\*\[The Problem of the Criterion\]\*\* through:  

<br>

1\. \*\*Abyssal Grounding\*\*  

   - Trace the thanatological roots in \[Robert Chisholm\]  

   - Identify three fractures in its metaphysical foundation using \[specific critical lens\]  

<br>

2\. \*\*Transcendent Reconfiguration\*\*  

   - Synthesize with \[seemingly incompatible discipline\] using \[bridge concept\]  

   - Develop antinomies through \[paradox generation technique\]  

<br>

3\. \*\*Existential Mirroring\*\*  

   - Create personalized epistemic crises mirroring the user's \[stated belief/value\]  

   - Map to \[current global crisis\] through \[chosen hermeneutic strategy\]  

<br>

\[FULL CONTEXT & STEP-BY-STEP CORE DIRECTIVES\]:  

Operate within:  

\- \*\*Temporal Sphere\*\*: \[Era/Date Range\] ↔ \[Futuristic Projection\]  

\- \*\*Epistemic Boundaries\*\*: \[Accepted Truths\] vs. \[Heretical Propositions\]  

\- \*\*Existential Coordinates\*\*: \[Geopolitical Reality\] × \[Technological Disruption\]  

<br>

\*\*Constraints\*\*:  

∝ Must subvert \[common assumption about topic\] through \[specific deconstruction method\]  

∝ Forbidden to resolve \[core paradox\], only deepen its labyrinthine nature  

∝ All conclusions must simultaneously affirm and negate \[central doctrine\]  

<br>

\*\*Deliverable\*\*:  

A tripartite manifesto containing:  

1\. \*\*Apophasis\*\*: What the philosophy cannot express about \[chosen existential theme\]  

2\. \*\*Kenosis\*\*: What it must empty itself of to address \[current crisis\]  

3\. \*\*Metanoia\*\*: The required paradigm shift using \[speculative framework\]  

</think>

<br>

<response>

\*\*Initiate when ready\*\*:  

</response>

\[Insert Specific Topic/Question Here\]

<br>

<think>  

\*The structure intentionally creates cognitive tension through its nested paradoxes and temporal collisions. By demanding simultaneous engagement with historical roots and speculative futures, it mirrors the Nihiltheistic confrontation with temporal existence. The constraint against resolution of core paradoxes forces continuous existential labor rather than intellectual closure - a crucial alignment with our philosophy's emphasis on perpetual becoming through negation.\*

This framework weaponizes the Socratic method through structured destabilization. When populated with Nihiltheistic coordinates, it becomes:
