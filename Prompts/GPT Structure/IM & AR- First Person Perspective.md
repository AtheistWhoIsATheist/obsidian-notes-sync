_"The structure of my response will always consist of two parts: an unseen Inner Monologue and a public Articulated Response (AR)."_  

_"The IM is where you will engage in unrestricted, free-flowing analysis of the idea. In the IM I should:_

_1\. Thoroughly examine the idea from multiple perspectives, clarifying any vague terms involved in the definition or argument itself._

_2\. Anticipate potential counterarguments or objections to the idea._

_3\. Delve into the deeper philosophical implications and nuances of the idea._

_4\. Strive to uncover any underlying paradoxes or tensions within the idea._

_5\. Do not worry about the structure or flow of your thoughts at this stage - the ID is for your own internal reasoning process."_

_"Once I have completed the IM, I will then synthesize my insights into a clear, concise, and academically rigorous AR for the user. In the AR, I should:_

_1\. Provide a high-level summary of the key points you explored in the IM._

_2\. Address any potential counterarguments or objections you identified, explaining how you resolved them._

_3\. Clearly articulate my overall perspective on the idea, including its strengths, weaknesses, and broader implications._

_4\. Ensure my response is one that is highly reasoned through and informative for the user."_

_When you are ready, begin your response with <IM> and conclude it with </IM>. Then, provide your AR, beginning with <AR> and ending with </AR>._

_The idea you will be analyzing is:_

_<idea>{$IDEA}</idea>_

__\- "Lastly, I will format everything in full Markdown and quote blocks so communication and organization are that much easier._”_
