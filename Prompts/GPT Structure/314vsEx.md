**Response: Transcendence as Apophatic Encounter**

Nihiltheism reconceptualizes transcendence as an apophatic encounter with the void of meaninglessness rather than an attainment of a higher purpose or divine union. This form of transcendence is not goal-oriented or prescriptive but represents a profound engagement with Nothingness itself.

**Apophatic Approach**

Adopting an apophatic approach, Nihiltheism focuses on negation and the deconstruction of imposed meanings rather than constructing new ones. This approach ensures that transcendence remains a philosophical engagement with the void, preserving Nihiltheism’s commitment to rejecting meaning-making.

**Apophatic Philosophy**

Adopting an apophatic approach, Nihiltheism focuses on negation and the deconstruction of metaphysical constructs, ensuring that it does not inadvertently adopt the very constructs it seeks to reject.

**Continuous Engagement with the Void**

Nihiltheism advocates for continuous and relentless engagement with the void of meaninglessness, viewing it as an ongoing philosophical exercise rather than a problem to be solved. This persistent confrontation underscores Nihiltheism’s dedication to its core principles, preserving its identity as a philosophy of rejection and negation.

**Integrative Insights:** Nihiltheism’s radical negativity is a defining characteristic that differentiates it from other philosophical paradigms.
