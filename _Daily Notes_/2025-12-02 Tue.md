# What did I think about on Tue, 2025-12-02?


## Perplexity Markmap
- Kierkegaard & Nurajuna
# Ontological Groundlessness: Kierkegaard & Nāgārjuna

## The Phenomenological Event (The Crash)
- **Vertigo/Dizziness** (The Affect)
  - *Kierkegaard:* Dizziness of Freedom
  - *Nāgārjuna:* Fear of Annihilation
- **Loss of Foundation** (The Structure)
  - Collapse of the "Inherent Self"
  - Exposure to the Infinite/Void
- **The Result**
  - No "floor" to stand on
  - Suspension over 70,000 fathoms

## Kierkegaard (The Western Response)
- **Key Term:** *Sickness Unto Death*
- **Mechanism:** Despair (Misrelation)
  - The Self trying to "be itself" without the Other
  - Friction of the Finite rubbing against the Infinite
- **Trajectory**
  - Finite Ego → Despair → **Transparent Grounding**
- **REN Mapping**
  - *Chapter 2: The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism*

## Nāgārjuna (The Eastern Response)
- **Key Term:** *Śūnyatā* (Emptiness)
- **Mechanism:** *Pratītyasamutpāda* (Dependent Origination)
  - Lack of *Svabhava* (Intrinsic Essence)
  - All things are relational, nothing is static
- **Trajectory**
  - Illusion of Substance → Deconstruction → **Nirvana**
- **REN Mapping**
  - *Chapter 5: The Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness*

## Nihiltheistic Synthesis (The Convergence)
- **The Core Insight**
  - The "Self" is a construct that *sickens* when it tries to be real.
- **The Paradox Resolution**
  - **True Self** (Kierkegaard) = **No-Self** (Nāgārjuna)
  - Both represent *Subjectivity without Self-Grounding*.
- **Neologism:** *Sacred Groundlessness*
  - The realization that "falling" is the Absolute.
