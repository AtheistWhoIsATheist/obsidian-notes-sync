# JOURNAL314 — Import & Navigation

This folder contains Obsidian-ready notes generated from the uploaded **Journal314** corpus.

## Files
- **JOURNAL314_markmap_compact.md** — A compact Markmap (Theme → Top Figures → Quotes)
- **JOURNAL314_matrix_top.md** — A human-readable matrix of top themes × figures (or figure counts if themes unavailable)

## How to use
1. Create a folder in your Vault named `JOURNAL314/`.
2. Create the two notes above with the exact filenames and paste the contents from this chat.
3. (Optional) Install the *Markmap* plugin to view `JOURNAL314_markmap_compact.md` as an interactive mind map.
4. Use Obsidian search to find figures, themes, and quotes. Add your own links, tags, and commentary.

> These notes are compact copies for iOS copy-paste. If you want the *full* matrix or a larger map, ask me for “more chunks” and I’ll paste them in additional notes.
