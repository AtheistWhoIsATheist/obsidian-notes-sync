## (Unclassified)
- Oh, what a distress it is for my soul to have to return to hold commerce with this world after having had its conversation in heaven! To have to play a part in the sad farce of this earthly life! _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- The best of created things disappoint and torment the soul...God alone satisfies the soul. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- All that such souls ever attain to and perform, all these things only make them more humble, and therefore more strong; more able to despise the things of this world... _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Augustine testifies that neither in the house, nor in the church, nor anywhere else, did he find God, till once he had found Him in himself. Nor had he need to go up to heaven, but only down into himself to find God. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- humility _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Prayer.—In prayer there would sometimes come upon me such a sense of the Presence of God that I seemed to be all engulfed in God. I think the learned call this mystical experience; at any rate, it so suspends the ordinary operations of the soul that she seems to be wholly taken out of herself. _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- Let him account himself utterly and hopelessly unworthy of everything he possesses, both in nature and in grace. Let him shun advancement. Let him apply himself to daily mortification, not of the body so much as of the mind and the heart, and let him be more than content with the least thing that God allows him, for this is true humility. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- For it must never be thought that because a man has much suffering, therefore he cannot have prayed acceptably. His suffering is as incense set forth before God. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- This will seem to some a silly fiction. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- “Oh, if we religious understood what harm we get from having so much to do with our _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Believe me, then, attachment to our relatives is, as I have said, the thing which sticks to _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- things and the rapidity with which they pass away, so that we may withdraw our _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- What sufferings they bore, what solitude, cold, thirst and hunger, what burning sun and heat! And yet they had no one to complain to except God. Do you suppose they were made of iron? No: they were as frail as we are. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- “Try not to fear these and commit yourselves wholly to God, come what may. What does _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- our own pleasures, for the least that anyone who is beginning to serve the Lord truly _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- I do not mean, by "leaving" everything, entering the religious life, for there may be obstacles to this, and the soul that is perfect can be detached and humble anywhere. It will find detachment harder in the world, however, for worldly trappings will be a great impediment to it. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- ...the very act of desiring honour robs us of it, especially in matters of precedence: there is no poison in the world which is so fatal to perfection. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- For the whole manner of life we are trying to live is making us, not only nuns, but hermits like the holy Fathers our predecessors and leading us to detachment from all things created. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- very sensitive and not capable of great mortification. It is indeed difficult at first, but I _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- We are not angels _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- We are not saints _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- “Although it is a great grace from God to practise self-examination, yet ‘too much is as bad as too little,’ as they say; believe me, by God’s help, we shall advance more by contemplating the _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- Divinity than by keeping our eyes fixed on ourselves, poor creatures of earth that we are.” _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- a nun has such a longing for penance as to feel no peace unless she is tormenting herself in some way. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- “But, O my God, how the force of worldly habits and the example of others who practise them _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- others who have travelled farther into the castle, who will aid her greatly and draw her to join _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- ‘Most happy she who suffers most if it be for Christ! _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- how to go on living, when I reflect upon it as I very often do.” _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Yet do not suppose that our Lord has need of any works of ours; He only expels us to manifest our goodwill. It seems to us we have done everything by taking the religious habit of our own will, and renouncing worldly things and all our possessions for God. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
## Epistemological Rupture
- World of light. I tell you it was a piteous and a dreadful thing to see. I knew not where to hide myself, for that shining light, in which was no darkness at all, held the whole world within it, and all worlds. You will see that I could not flee from its presence. Oh that they could be made to see this who commit deeds of darkness! _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- You need not go to heaven to see God, or to regale yourself with God. Nor need you speak loud as if He were far away. Nor need you cry for wings like a dove so as to fly to Him. Settle yourself in solitude, and you will come upon God in yourself. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- May His Divine Majesty vouchsafe to let us see and taste and understand something of this before He takes us out of this prison-house life, for it will be a magnificent comfort in the hour of death to know that we are on our way to be judged by Him whom we have loved above all things. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Our Lord, my sisters, expects works. Therefore when you see any one sick, compassionate her as if she were yourself. Pity her. Fast that she may eat. Wake that she may sleep. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- At other times I find myself so arid that I am not able to form any distinct idea of God, nor can I put my soul into an attitude of prayer, though I am in the place of prayer, and though I feel that I know something of God. This mind of mine at such times is like a born fool or some idiot creature that nothing can bind down. I cannot command myself. I cannot properly say one Credo. At such times I laugh bitterly at myself, and see clearly my own natural misery. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- I reflect at such times on the great hurt our original sin has done us. For it is from our first fall that all this has come to us that we so wander from God, and are so often utterly incapable of God. But it is not so much Adam’s sin as my own that works in me all this alienation and inability and aridity. Methinks I love God; but my actions, and the endless imperfections I see in myself, cause me great fear, and deep and inconsolable distress. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- And the soul enjoys God without dialectically understanding just how she so enjoys Him. She burns with love without knowing what she has done to deserve or to prepare herself for such a rapture. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Now this is the difference between natural and supernatural prayer: between mental and transcendental prayer. In ordinary prayer we more or less understand what we say and do. We think of Him to whom we speak; we think about ourselves and about our Surety and Mediator. In all this, by God’s help, we can do something, so to speak, of ourselves. But in pure supernatural and transcendental prayer, we do nothing at all. His Divine Majesty it is who does it all. He works in us at such elect seasons what far transcends and overtops all the powers and resources even of the renewed nature. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- relatives, how we should shun them! do not see what pleasure they can give us, or how, quite apart from the harm they do us as touching our obligations to God, they can bring us any peace or tranquillity.” _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- I do not know how much of the world we really leave when we say that we are leaving everything for God's sake, if we do not withdraw ourselves from the chief thing of all -- namely, our kinsfolk. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- know that, with the Lord's help, the gradual attainment of this freedom, and of renunciation and self-detachment, is quite possible.” _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- What a sight it would have been, daughters, to see this Sun by the side of the darkness, and what fear that wretched creature must have felt, though he would not have known why, since God did not allow Him to understand. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Progress has nothing to do with enjoying the greatest number of consolations in prayer, or with raptures, visions or favours often given by the Lord, the value of which we cannot estimate until we reach the world to come. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- I really see no good in this world and its ways... _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Would it not be gross ignorance, my daughters, if, when a man was questioned about his name, or country, or parents, he could not answer? Stupid as this would be, it is unspeakably more foolish to care to learn nothing of our nature except that we possess bodies, and only to realize vaguely that we have souls, because people say so and it is a doctrine of faith. Rarely do we reflect upon what gifts our souls may possess... _(REN: 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- As far as I can understand, the gate by which to enter this castle is prayer and meditation. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- How unhappy it feels, not knowing whether to go forward or to return to the first mansion! On the other hand, reason shows it the delusion of overrating worldly things, while faith teaches what alone can satisfy its cravings. Memory reminds the soul how all earthly joys end, recalling the death of those who lived at ease; how some died suddenly and were soon forgotten, how others, once so prosperous, are now buried beneath the ground and men pass by the graves where they lie, the prey of worms, while the mind recalls many other such incidents. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- ruin everything! Our faith is so dead that we trust less to its teaching than to what is visible, though, indeed, we see that worldly lives bring nothing but unhappiness.” _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- “Enlighten it to see that its welfare consists in perseverance in the right way, and in the withdrawing from bad company. It is of the utmost importance for the beginner to associate with those who lead a spiritual life, and not only with those in the same mansion as herself, but with _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- “I am wrong in saying ‘security,’ for there is no security in this life; understand that in such _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- “Truly, my daughters, I feel such terror as I tell you this, that I know not how to write it, nor even _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Still I must give you one warning: be not too confident because you are nuns and the daughters of such a Mother. David was very holy, yet you know what Solomon became. Therefore do not rely on your enclosure, on your penitential life, nor on your continual exercise of prayer and constant communion with God, nor trust in having left the world or in the idea that you hold its ways in horror. All this is good, but is not enough, as I have already said, to remove all fear; therefore meditate on this text and often recall it: 'Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord.' _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
## Ethical Collapse
- God deliver me from this artificial and evil life! _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Our Lord, my sisters, expects works. Therefore when you see any one sick, compassionate her as if she were yourself. Pity her. Fast that she may eat. Wake that she may sleep. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Let no one be affrighted or turned away from the life of virtue and religion by your gloom and morosity. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- It is indeed a very great misery to live on in this evil world where our enemies are ever at our gate, and where we can neither eat nor sleep in peace, but are compelled to have our armour on night and day. There is no rest here, nor happiness, nor will be till we are with the Everlastingly Blessed. As I write I am seized with terror, lest I should never escape this sinful life. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- There is nothing in all the world wherewith to buy the shedding abroad of Thy love in our heart, but our heart’s love. If, however, we did what we could, not clinging with our hearts to anything whatsoever in this world, but having our treasure and our conversation in heaven, then this blessedness would soon be ours, as all Thy saints testify. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- I reflect at such times on the great hurt our original sin has done us. For it is from our first fall that all this has come to us that we so wander from God, and are so often utterly incapable of God. But it is not so much Adam’s sin as my own that works in me all this alienation and inability and aridity. Methinks I love God; but my actions, and the endless imperfections I see in myself, cause me great fear, and deep and inconsolable distress. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- And the soul enjoys God without dialectically understanding just how she so enjoys Him. She burns with love without knowing what she has done to deserve or to prepare herself for such a rapture. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- At the same time, as a far-off means of attaining to supernatural prayer, it is necessary to put upon ourselves the acquiring of the great virtues, and especially, humility: we must give up and resign ourselves wholly and entirely unto God. Whoever will not attempt to do this, with all the grace of God, that man will never come within sight of the highest prayer. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- “All the advice which the saints give us about fleeing from the world is, of course, good. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- ...it remains for us to become detached from our own selves and it is a hard thing to withdraw from ourselves and oppose ourselves, because we are very close to ourselves and love ourselves very dearly. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- A discontented soul is like a person suffering from severe nausea, who rejects all food, however nice it may be; things which persons in good health delight in eating only cause her the greater loathing. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- anyone who would be perfect, must flee a thousand leagues from such phrases as: "I had right on my side"; "They had no right to do this to me"; "The person who treated me like this was not right". God deliver us from such a false idea of right as that!...Do you think that it was right for our good Jesus to have to suffer so many insults, and that those who heaped them on Him?...Do you think you can ever possibly have to bear so much that you ought not to have to bear any more? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- This house is another Heaven, if it be possible to have Heaven upon earth. Anyone whose sole pleasure lies in pleasing God and who cares nothing for her own pleasure will find our life a very good one; if she wants anything more, she will lose everything, for there is nothing more that she can have. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Why, then, my sisters, do we not show Him love in so far as we can? Consider what a wonderful exchange it is if we give Him our love and receive His. Consider that He can do all things, and we can do nothing here below save as He enables us. And what is it that we do for Thee, O Lord, our Maker? We do hardly anything at all -- just make some poor weak resolution. And, if His Majesty is pleased that by doing a mere nothing we should win everything, let us not be so foolish as to fail to do it. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- whenever we commit some imperfection. We may not be; but what a good thing it is for _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- I really see no good in this world and its ways... _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- “Such, it appears to me, is the soul which, though not in a state of mortal sin, is so worldly _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Still I must give you one warning: be not too confident because you are nuns and the daughters of such a Mother. David was very holy, yet you know what Solomon became. Therefore do not rely on your enclosure, on your penitential life, nor on your continual exercise of prayer and constant communion with God, nor trust in having left the world or in the idea that you hold its ways in horror. All this is good, but is not enough, as I have already said, to remove all fear; therefore meditate on this text and often recall it: 'Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord.' _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
## Linguistic Futility
- You need not go to heaven to see God, or to regale yourself with God. Nor need you speak loud as if He were far away. Nor need you cry for wings like a dove so as to fly to Him. Settle yourself in solitude, and you will come upon God in yourself. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Now this is the difference between natural and supernatural prayer: between mental and transcendental prayer. In ordinary prayer we more or less understand what we say and do. We think of Him to whom we speak; we think about ourselves and about our Surety and Mediator. In all this, by God’s help, we can do something, so to speak, of ourselves. But in pure supernatural and transcendental prayer, we do nothing at all. His Divine Majesty it is who does it all. He works in us at such elect seasons what far transcends and overtops all the powers and resources even of the renewed nature. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- And now I return most humbly to beseech your Reverence, that, if you mean to impart to any one these things that you have made me write concerning prayer, let them be imparted to spiritual persons, and to persons of real insight only. For, indeed, I have written for persons of exceptional experience and exceptional prudence only. What I have written, I fear, very few are capable of. But what am I, to speak thus about any but myself? _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- “For it is in this way that you will begin to gain freedom; soon you will not care if they speak ill or well of you; it will seem like someone else's business. It will be as if two persons are talking _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Would it not be gross ignorance, my daughters, if, when a man was questioned about his name, or country, or parents, he could not answer?

## Ontological Abyss
- May His Divine Majesty vouchsafe to let us see and taste and understand something of this before He takes us out of this prison-house life, for it will be a magnificent comfort in the hour of death to know that we are on our way to be judged by Him whom we have loved above all things. _(REN: 2.

- There is nothing in all the world wherewith to buy the shedding abroad of Thy love in our heart, but our heart’s love. If, however, we did what we could, not clinging with our hearts to anything whatsoever in this world, but having our treasure and our conversation in heaven, then this blessedness would soon be ours, as all Thy saints testify. _(REN: 3.

At such times I laugh bitterly at myself, and see clearly my own natural misery. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- Those who pray with proper preparation: that is, with much meditation on the whole life and death of our Lord: on their own death: on the last day, or such like, our Lord will bring all such to the port of light. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Now this is the difference between natural and supernatural prayer: between mental and transcendental prayer. In ordinary prayer we more or less understand what we say and do. We think of Him to whom we speak; we think about ourselves and about our Surety and Mediator. In all this, by God’s help, we can do something, so to speak, of ourselves.

- he cares nothing if he loses everything, nor does he count this as loss. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- ...if she does not wish to suffer a hell on earth, and God grant there may not be another hell awaiting such a nun in the world to come. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- This house is another Heaven, if it be possible to have Heaven upon earth. Anyone whose sole pleasure lies in pleasing God and who cares nothing for her own pleasure will find our life a very good one; if she wants anything more, she will lose everything, for there is nothing more that she can have. _(REN: (Unassigned))_

Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- It is therefore a thirst which quenches nothing but desire for earthly things... _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- We have an immeasurable longing for it, and, so far as is possible on earth, we stimulate this longing: sometimes this goes so far as to cause death. How happy is such a death! _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Would it not be gross ignorance, my daughters, if, when a man was questioned about his name, or country, or parents, he could not answer?

- cases I always imply: ‘If they do not cease to continue as they have begun.’ What misery to live in this world! We are like men whose enemies are at the door, who must not lay aside their arms, even while sleeping or eating, and are always in dread lest the foe should enter the fortress by some breach in the walls. How canst Thou wish us to prize such a wretched existence?” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
## Teleological Paradox
- ...people seem to have found their aim and end in life in this horrible prison-house... _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- O my Lord, why keepest Thou Thy servant in this miserable life so long, where all is such vexation, and disappointment, and manifold trouble? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Some of us, however, seem to think that we embraced the religious life for no other reason than to keep ourselves alive and each nun does all she can to that end. Resolve, sisters, that it is to die for Christ, and not to practice self-indulgence for Christ, that you have come here. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- after the time of our resolving to render our entire service to God? This would be quite possible; and so we must not set store by anything that comes to an end, least of all by life, since not a day of it is secure.” _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- What a sight it would have been, daughters, to see this Sun by the side of the darkness, and what fear that wretched creature must have felt, though he would not have known why, since God did not allow Him to understand. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
