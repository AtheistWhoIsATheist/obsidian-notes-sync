- in it is growing farther and farther apart. As it does so, it grows colder and colder, and its energy is used up. Eventually all the stars will burn out and all matter will collapse into dead stars and black holes. There will be no light at all; there will be no heat; there will be no life; only the corpses of dead stars and galaxies, ever expanding into the endless darkness and the cold recesses of _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_

- down the poison. But then to his horror, he discovered he had swallowed the wrong vial—he had _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- So what? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- French existentialists Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus understood this, too. Sartre portrayed _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Well, let's get on with it. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- nausea _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- If life ends at the grave, then it makes no difference whether one has lived as a Stalin or as a saint. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Since one's destiny is ultimately unrelated to one's behavior, you may as well just live as you _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- If there is no immortality then all things are permitted. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- rational persons, unhoodwinked by myth or ideology, need not be individual egoists or classical _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- But the problem becomes even worse. For, regardless of immortality, if there is no God, then there _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- can be no objective standards of right and wrong. All we are confronted with is, in Jean-Paul _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- objective right and wrong, only our culturally and personally relative, subjective judgments. This _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- exist—there is only the bare valueless fact of existence, and there is no one to say you are right _(REN: 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- such a prospect. In his novel The Time Machine Wells's time traveler journeys far into the future to discover the destiny of man. All he finds is a dead earth, save for a few lichens and moss, orbiting a gigantic red sun. The only sounds are the rush of the wind and the gentle ripple of the sea. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Beyond these lifeless sounds, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- For man and the universe would then be simple accidents of chance, thrust into existence for no _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- reason. Without God the universe is the result of a cosmic accident, a chance explosion. There is _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- no reason for which it exists. As for man, he is a freak of nature— a blind product of matter plus _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- If God is dead, then man is dead, too. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- I seek God! I seek God! _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Did God get lost? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Or is he hiding? Or maybe he has gone on a voyage or emigrated! _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- I have come too early, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- This tremendous event is still on its way—it has not yet reached the ears of man. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Most people still do not reflect on the consequences of atheism and so, like the crowd in the _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- marketplace, go unknowingly on their way. But when we realize, as did Nietzsche, what atheism _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- implies, then his question presses hard upon us: how shall we, the murderers of all murderers, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Bertrand Russell, for example, wrote that we must build our lives upon "the firm foundation of _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Russell, too, was inconsistent. For though he was an atheist, he was an outspoken social critic, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- incredible. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- All things are permitted. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- perfectly all right for soldiers to slaughter innocent children. He cannot live as though it is all right for dictators like Pol Pot to exterminate millions of their own countrymen. Everything in him cries out to say these acts are wrong—really wrong. But if there is no God, he cannot. So he makes a leap of faith and affirms values anyway. And when he does so, he reveals the inadequacy of a _(REN: 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- The Gathering. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- survivors of the Holocaust in Jerusalem, where they rediscovered lost friendships and shared their _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- experiences. One woman prisoner, a nurse, told of how she was made the gynecologist at _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- Where are the pregnant women who were housed in that barracks? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Haven't you heard? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Dr. Mengele used them for vivisection. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- coffee, but to no avail. Each day the baby lost weight, a fact that was eagerly monitored by Dr. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Mengele. A nurse then came secretly to this woman and told her, "I have arranged a way for you _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- When the woman protested, the nurse was insistent: _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- And yet, if God does not exist, then in a sense, our world is Auschwitz: there is no absolute right _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- and wrong; all things are permitted. But no atheist, no agnostic, can live consistently with such a _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- German nationalism. Similarly Sartre, writing in the aftermath of the Second World War, _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- condemned anti-Semitism, declaring that a doctrine that leads to extermination is not merely an _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- opinion or matter of personal taste, of equal value with its opposite. (8) In his important essay _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Existentialism Is a Humanism, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- which is in man. The communist torturers often said, 'There is no God, no Hereafter, no _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- And the same applies to acts of self-sacrifice. A number of years ago, a terrible mid-winter air _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- disaster occurred in which a plane leaving the Washington, D.C., airport smashed into a bridge _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- spanning the Potomac River, plunging its passengers into the icy waters. As the rescue helicopters came, attention was focused on one man who again and again pushed the dangling rope ladder to other passengers rather than be pulled to safety himself. Six times he passed the ladder by. When they came again, he was gone. He had freely given his life that others might live. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- subconsciously borrowing the belief in immortality that his forefathers held to, even though he _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- himself has no basis for this belief, since he does not believe in God. By borrowing the remnants of a belief in immortality, writes Bloch, "modern man does not feel the chasm that unceasingly _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- surrounds him and that will certainly engulf him at last. Through these remnants, he saves his _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- sense of self-identity. Through them the impression arises that man is not perishing, but only that _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Bloch concludes, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- which everything is the product of blind chance, these persons begin to ascribe personality and _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- leap from the lower to the upper story. For example, Francis Crick halfway through his book The _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- clever _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- thinking _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Cosmos, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- which he always spells with a capital letter, obviously fills the role of a God-substitute. Though all _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- these men profess not to believe in God, they smuggle in a God-substitute through the back door because they cannot bear to live in a universe in which everything is the chance result of _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- conclusions. For example, certain feminists have raised a storm of protest over Freudian sexual _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- society envisioned in George Orwell's 1984, where the government controls and programs the _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- thoughts of everybody. If Skinner's theories are right, then there can be no objection to treating _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- people like the rats in Skinner's rat-box as they run through their mazes, coaxed on by food and _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- electric shocks. According to Skinner, all our actions are determined anyway. And if God does not _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- qualitatively different from a rat, since both are just matter plus time plus chance. But again, who _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- post-modern _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- as well. Indeed, it is precisely the awareness that modernism issues inevitably in absurdity and _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- Confronted with this dilemma, man flounders pathetically for some means of escape. In a _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- remarkable address to the American Academy for the Advancement of Science in 1991, Dr. L. D. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Noble Lie _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- the madhouse option, _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- totalitarian option," where social coherence is imposed at the expense of personal wholenesthen _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- interests and so achieve social coherence. A Noble Lie "is one that deceives us, tricks us, compels _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- us beyond self-interest, beyond ego, beyond family, nation, (and) race." It is a lie, because it tells _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- us that the universe is infused with value (which is a great fiction), because it makes a claim to _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- But without such lies, we cannot live. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- for the sake of social coherence, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- the interest of the herd do not always coincide. Besides, if (out of self-interest) I do care about _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- social coherence, the totalitarian option is always open to me: forget the Noble Lie and maintain _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- have done is clearly spell out the alternatives. If God does not exist, then life is futile. If the God of _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- the Bible does exist, then life is meaningful. Only the second of these two alternatives enables us _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- to live happily and consistently. Therefore, it seems to me that even if the evidence for these two _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- options were absolutely equal, a rational person ought to choose biblical Christianity. It seems to _(REN: (Unassigned))_
## Epistemological Rupture
- eventually swallow them all again. And the same is true of each individual person. The contributions of the scientist to the advance of human knowledge, the researches of the doctor to alleviate pain and suffering, the efforts of the diplomat to secure peace in the world, the sacrifices of good men everywhere to better the lot of the human race--all these come to nothing. This is the horror of modern man: because he ends in nothing, he is nothing. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- During this entire play two men carry on trivial conversation while waiting for a third man to arrive, who never does. Our lives are like that, Beckett is saying; we just kill time waiting—for what, we don't know. In a tragic portrayal of man, Beckett wrote another play in which the curtain opens revealing a stage littered with junk. For thirty long seconds, the audience sits and stares in silence _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- Reflection on it depresses me . . . . Pure practical reason, even with a good knowledge of the facts, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- to say that something is wrong because . . . it is forbidden by God, is . . . perfectly understandable to anyone who believes in a law-giving God. But to say that something is wrong . . . even though no God exists to forbid it, is not understandable. . . . _(REN: 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- consistently and happily knowing that life is meaningless; so in order to be happy he pretends life has meaning. But this is, of course, entirely inconsistent—for without God, man and the universe are without any real significance. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- I do not know the solution, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- universal truth (when there is none), and because it tells me not to live for self-interest (which is _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- relativism, then why (if we could) pretend that we do not know this truth and live a lie instead? If _(REN: (Unassigned))_
## Ethical Collapse
- eventually swallow them all again. And the same is true of each individual person. The contributions of the scientist to the advance of human knowledge, the researches of the doctor to alleviate pain and suffering, the efforts of the diplomat to secure peace in the world, the sacrifices of good men everywhere to better the lot of the human race--all these come to nothing. This is the horror of modern man: because he ends in nothing, he is nothing. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- basis, a writer like Ayn Rand is absolutely correct to praise the virtues of selfishness. Live totally _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- for self; no one holds you accountable! Indeed, it would be foolish to do anything else, for life is too short to jeopardize it by acting out of anything but pure self-interest. Sacrifice for another person would be stupid. Kai Nielsen, an atheist philosopher who attempts to defend the viability of ethics without God, in the end admits, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- We have not been able to show that reason requires the moral point of view, or that all really _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Reflection on it depresses me . . . . Pure practical reason, even with a good knowledge of the facts, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Sartre's words, the bare, valueless fact of existence. Moral values are either just expressions of _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The concept of moral obligation (is) unintelligible apart from the idea of God. The words remain but their meaning is gone. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- means that it is impossible to condemn war, oppression, or crime as evil. Nor can one praise _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- brotherhood, equality, and love as good. For in a universe without God, good and evil do not _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Turn now to the problem of value. Here is where the most blatant inconsistencies occur. First of all, atheistic humanists are totally inconsistent in affirming the traditional values of love and _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- though ethical values were simply a matter of personal taste, and that he therefore found his own _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- view. Nietzsche himself, who proclaimed the necessity of living beyond good and evil, broke with _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- persons. Like Russell, he could not live with the implications of his own denial of ethical absolutes. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- A second problem is that if God does not exist and there is no immortality, then all the evil acts of men go unpunished and all the sacrifices of good men go unrewarded. But who can live with such a view? Richard Wurmbrand, who has been tortured for his faith in communist prisons, says, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- punishment for evil. We can do what we wish.' I have heard one torturer even say, 'I thank God, in _(REN: 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- whom I don't believe, that I have lived to this hour when I can express all the evil in my heart.' He _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- exist, then no moral objection can be raised against this kind of programming, for man is not _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The lesson of the past two centuries is that intellectual and moral relativism is profoundly the case, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
## Linguistic Futility
- During this entire play two men carry on trivial conversation while waiting for a third man to arrive, who never does. Our lives are like that, Beckett is saying; we just kill time waiting—for what, we don't know. In a tragic portrayal of man, Beckett wrote another play in which the curtain opens revealing a stage littered with junk. For thirty long seconds, the audience sits and stares in silence _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- Sartre's words, the bare, valueless fact of existence. Moral values are either just expressions of _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The concept of moral obligation (is) unintelligible apart from the idea of God. The words remain but their meaning is gone. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- for their own sakes; in other words, they are objective values, which according to his philosophy do not exist. He has already leapt to the upper story. The Noble Lie option thus affirms what it denies and so refutes itself. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
## Ontological Abyss
- Why on atheism life has no ultimate meaning, value, or purpose, and why this view is unlivable. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- You are the accidental by-product of nature, a result of matter plus time plus chance. There is no reason for your existence. All you face is death. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- my death: I am going to die _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- And the universe, too, faces death. Scientists tell us that the universe is expanding, and everything _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- If there is no God, then man and the universe are doomed. Like prisoners condemned to death, we await our unavoidable execution. There is no God, and there is no immortality. And what is the consequence of this? It means that life itself is absurd. It means that the life we have is without ultimate significance, value, or purpose. Let's look at each of these. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- If each individual person passes out of existence when he dies, then what ultimate meaning can be given to his life? Does it really matter whether he ever existed at all? His life may be important _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- the events are meaningless, then what can be the ultimate meaning of influencing any of them? _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- eventually swallow them all again. And the same is true of each individual person. The contributions of the scientist to the advance of human knowledge, the researches of the doctor to alleviate pain and suffering, the efforts of the diplomat to secure peace in the world, the sacrifices of good men everywhere to better the lot of the human race--all these come to nothing. This is the horror of modern man: because he ends in nothing, he is nothing. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Thus, if there is no God, then life itself becomes meaningless. Man and the universe are without _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- The concept of moral obligation (is) unintelligible apart from the idea of God. The words remain but their meaning is gone. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- If death stands with open arms at the end of life's trail, then what is the goal of life? Is it all for _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- nothing? Is there no reason for life? And what of the universe? Is it utterly pointless? If its destiny is a cold grave in the recesses of outer space the answer must be, yes—it is pointless. There is no _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same. As one dies so dies the other; indeed, they all have the same breath and there is no advantage for man over beast, for all is vanity. All go to the same place. All come from the dust and all return to the dust _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- Vanity of vanities! All is vanity _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- ends at the grave, then we have no ultimate purpose for living. But more than that: even if it did not end in death, without God life would still be without purpose. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- purposeless life. So if God does not exist, that means that man and the universe exist to no purpose—since the end of everything is death—and that they came to be for no purpose, since they are only blind products of chance. In short, life is utterly without reason. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Unfortunately, the mass of mankind do not realize this fact. They continue on as though nothing _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The fundamental problem with this solution, however, is that it is impossible to live consistently and happily within such a world view. If one lives consistently, he will not be happy; if one lives happily, it is only because he is not consistent. Francis Schaeffer has explained this point well. Modern man, says Schaeffer, resides in a two-story universe. In the lower story is the finite world without God; here life is absurd, as we have seen. In the upper story are meaning, value, and purpose. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- happily in such an absurd world; therefore, he continually makes leaps of faith into the upper story to affirm meaning, value, and purpose, even though he has no right to, since he does not believe in God. Let's look again, then, at each of the three areas in which we saw life was absurd without God, to show how man cannot live consistently and happily with his atheism. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- First, the area of meaning. We saw that without God, life has no meaning. Yet philosophers _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- continue to live as though life does have meaning. For example, Sartre argued that one may _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Let's pretend the universe has meaning. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- *The point is this*: if God does not exist, then life is objectively meaningless; but man cannot live _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- consistently and happily knowing that life is meaningless; so in order to be happy he pretends life has meaning. But this is, of course, entirely inconsistent—for without God, man and the universe are without any real significance. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- Finally, let's look at the problem of purpose in life. The only way most people who deny purpose in life live happily is either by making up some purpose, which amounts to self-delusion as we saw with Sartre, or by not carrying their view to its logical conclusions. Take the problem of death, for example. According to Ernst Bloch, the only way modern man lives in the face of death is by _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- despair that constitutes the anguish of post-modernism. In some respects, post-modernism just is _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- without meaning, value, or purpose. If we try to live consistently within the atheistic world view, we shall find ourselves profoundly unhappy. If instead we manage to live happily, it is only by giving the lie to our world view. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- me positively irrational to prefer death, futility, and destruction to life, meaningfulness, and _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- happiness. As Pascal said, we have nothing to lose and infinity to gain. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
## Teleological Paradox
- Why on atheism life has no ultimate meaning, value, or purpose, and why this view is unlivable. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Why? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Why am I here? Where am I going? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- If there is no God, then man and the universe are doomed. Like prisoners condemned to death, we await our unavoidable execution. There is no God, and there is no immortality. And what is the consequence of this? It means that life itself is absurd. It means that the life we have is without ultimate significance, value, or purpose. Let's look at each of these. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Mankind is thus no more significant than a swarm of mosquitos or a barnyard of pigs, for their end is all the same. The same blind cosmic process that coughed them up in the first place will _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- for self; no one holds you accountable! Indeed, it would be foolish to do anything else, for life is too short to jeopardize it by acting out of anything but pure self-interest. Sacrifice for another person would be stupid. Kai Nielsen, an atheist philosopher who attempts to defend the viability of ethics without God, in the end admits, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- If death stands with open arms at the end of life's trail, then what is the goal of life? Is it all for _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the background of our lives—all that was over." (3) And so Wells's time traveler returned. But to what?—to merely an earlier point on the purposeless rush toward oblivion. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- No, no! It can't end that way! _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- there is no God, it will end that way, like it or not. This is reality in a universe without God: there is _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- ends at the grave, then we have no ultimate purpose for living. But more than that: even if it did not end in death, without God life would still be without purpose. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- What is true of the universe and of the human race is also true of us as individuals. If God does not exist, then you are just a miscarriage of nature, thrust into a purposeless universe to live a _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- purposeless life. So if God does not exist, that means that man and the universe exist to no purpose—since the end of everything is death—and that they came to be for no purpose, since they are only blind products of chance. In short, life is utterly without reason. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- The fundamental problem with this solution, however, is that it is impossible to live consistently and happily within such a world view. If one lives consistently, he will not be happy; if one lives happily, it is only because he is not consistent. Francis Schaeffer has explained this point well. Modern man, says Schaeffer, resides in a two-story universe. In the lower story is the finite world without God; here life is absurd, as we have seen. In the upper story are meaning, value, and purpose. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- happily in such an absurd world; therefore, he continually makes leaps of faith into the upper story to affirm meaning, value, and purpose, even though he has no right to, since he does not believe in God. Let's look again, then, at each of the three areas in which we saw life was absurd without God, to show how man cannot live consistently and happily with his atheism. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Finally, let's look at the problem of purpose in life. The only way most people who deny purpose in life live happily is either by making up some purpose, which amounts to self-delusion as we saw with Sartre, or by not carrying their view to its logical conclusions. Take the problem of death, for example. According to Ernst Bloch, the only way modern man lives in the face of death is by _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- exist for no reason or purpose, but just by chance. Unable to live in an impersonal universe in _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- without meaning, value, or purpose. If we try to live consistently within the atheistic world view, we shall find ourselves profoundly unhappy. If instead we manage to live happily, it is only by giving the lie to our world view. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- relativism, then why (if we could) pretend that we do not know this truth and live a lie instead? If _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- But if atheism fails in this regard, what about biblical Christianity? According to the Christian world view, God does exist, and man's life does not end at the grave. In the resurrection body man may enjoy eternal life and fellowship with God. Biblical Christianity therefore provides the two conditions necessary for a meaningful, valuable, and purposeful life for man: God and immortality. Because of this, we can live consistently and happily. Thus, biblical Christianity succeeds precisely where atheism breaks down. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
