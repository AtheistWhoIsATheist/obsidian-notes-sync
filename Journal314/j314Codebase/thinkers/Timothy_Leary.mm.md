## (Unclassified)
- Admit it. You aren’t like them. You’re not even close. You may occasionally dress yourself up as one of them, watch the same mindless television shows as they do, maybe even eat the same fast food sometimes. But it seems that the more you try to fit in, the more you feel like an outsider, watching the “normal people _(REN: (Unassigned))_

- Caesar _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Everything that exists outside your body and your shrine belongs to Caesar. Caesar has constructed the fake-prop studio for his "king-of -the-mountain"game, and he can have it. Highways, property, status, power, money, weapons, all things, all external man-made objects belong to him. The spiritual life is completely detached from these props. _(REN: 3.

- Did you imagine that there could be emotions in heaven? Emotions are closely tied to ego games. Check your emotions at the door to paradise. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
## Epistemological Rupture

- Do you wish to use marijuana and LSD to get beyond the TV scenario? To enhance creativity? As catalysts to deepen wisdom? If so, you will be helped by making explicit the religious nature of your psychedelic activities. _(REN: (Unassigned))_

To think for yourself you must question authority and learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable, open-mindedness; chaotic, confused, vulnerability to inform yourself. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
## Linguistic Futility

Say it naturally. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_

- Your mythic guide must be one who has solved the death-rebirth riddle. A TV drama hero cannot help you. Caesar, Napoleon, Kennedy are no help to your cellular orientation. Christ, Lao Tse, Hermes Trismegistus, Socrates are recurrent turn-on figures.” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
## Teleological Paradox
