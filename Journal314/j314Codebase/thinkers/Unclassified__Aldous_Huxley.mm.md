- Contemplatives are not likely to become gamblers, or procurers, or drunkards; they do not as a rule preach intolerance, or make war; do not find it necessary to rob, swindle or grind the faces of the poor. _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- ...if they practice it in the height, they will become conduits through which some beneficent influence can flow out of that other country into a world of darkened selves, chronically dying for lack of it. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- Trivial. Like things in a five-and-ten. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- It’s as though one were below decks in a ship, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- A five-and-ten-cent ship. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Mescalin opens up the way of Mary, but shuts the door on that of Martha. It gives access to contemplation— but to a contemplation that is incompatible with action and even with the will to action, the very thought of action. In the intervals between his revelations the mescalin taker is apt to feel that, though in one way everything is supremely as it should be, in another there is something wrong. His problem is essentially the same as that which confronts the quietist... _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- For if one always saw like this, one would never want to do anything else. Just looking, just being the divine Not-self of flower, of book, of chair, of flannel. That would be enough. But in that case what about other people? What about human relations? _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- In life, man proposes, God disposes. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The whole is disorganized. But each individual fragment is in order, is a representative of a Higher Order. The Highest Order prevails even in the disintegration. The totality is present even in the broken pieces. More clearly present, perhaps, than in a completely coherent work. At least you aren’t lulled into a sense of false security by some merely human, merely fabricated order. You have to rely on your immediate perception of the ultimate order. So in a certain sense disintegration may have its advantages. But of course it’s dangerous, horribly dangerous. Suppose you couldn’t get back, out of the chaos… _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- And anyhow the body seemed perfectly well able to look after itself. In reality, of course, it always does look after itself. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- It was inexpressibly wonderful, wonderful to the point, almost, of being terrifying. And suddenly I had an inkling of what it must feel like to be mad. Schizophrenia has its heavens as well as its hells and purgatories. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- Alas, this paradise of cleansed perception, of pure one-sided contemplation, was not to endure. The blissful intermissions became rarer, became briefer, until finally there were no more of them; there was only horror. Most takers of mescalin experience only the heavenly part of schizophrenia. _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- Yes. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- And you couldn’t control it? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- No I couldn’t control it. If one began with fear and hate as the major premise, one would have to go on to the conclusion. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Would you be able, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- to fix your attention on what The Tibetan Book of the Dead calls the Clear Light? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Perhaps, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- perhaps I could— but only if there were somebody there to tell me about the Clear Light. One couldn’t do it by oneself. That’s the point, I suppose, of the Tibetan ritual— someone sitting there all the time and telling you what’s what. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- O nobly born, let not thy mind be distracted. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Verbalists are suspicious of the non-verbal; rationalists fear the given, non-rational fact; intellectuals feel that “what we perceive by the eye (or in any other way) is foreign to us as such and need not impress us deeply. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- “From glass, stained or cut, we pass to marble and the other stones that take a high polish and can be used in mass. The fascination exercised by such stones may be gauged by the amount of time and trouble spent in obtaining them. At Baalbek, for example, and, two or three hundred miles further inland, at Palmyra, we find among the ruins columns of pink granite from Aswan. These great monoliths were quarried in Upper Egypt, were floated in barges down the Nile, _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- were towed across the Mediterranean to Byblos or Tripolis, and from thence were hauled, by oxen, mules, and men, uphill to Horns, and from Horns southward to Baalbek or east, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- across the desert, to Palmyra. What a labour of giants! And, from the utilitarian point _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- of view, how marvellously pointless! But in fact, of course, there was a point - a point _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- the System, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- mescalin; and there is also an experience, beyond time, of union with the divine Ground.” _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- ...the ultimate Reality is not clearly and immediately apprehended, except by those who have made themselves loving, pure in heart and poor in spirit. This being so, it is hardly surprising that a theology based upon the experience of nice, ordinary, unregenerate people should carry so little conviction. This kind of empirical theology is on precisely the same footing as an empirical astronomy, based upon the experience of naked-eye observers. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- “...no saint or founder of a religion, no exponent of the Perennial Philosophy, has ever been optimistic. 'Many are called, but few are chosen.' _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- For long periods of history and prehistory it would seem that men and women, though perfectly capable of doing so, did not wish to pay attention to problems, which their descendents found absorbingly interesting. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- ...in modern industrialized societies, a few people work their way out of the prevailing occupation with matter and through the prevailing habits of analytical thought into the direct experience of the spiritual Ground of things. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Nobody has yet invented a Spiritual Calculus, in terms of which we may talk coherently about the divine Ground and of the world conceived as its manifestation. For the present, therefore, we must be patient with the linguistic eccentricities of those who are compelled to describe one order of experience in terms of a symbol-system, whose relevance is to the facts of another and quite different order. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- The Cloud of the Unknowing: “This sorrow, if it be truly conceived, is full of holy desire... _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- Sometimes crisis alone, without any preparatory training, is sufficient to make a man forget to be his customary self and become, for the time being, something quite different. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- ...the aim of spiritual training is to make people become selfless in every circumstance of life, while the aim of military training is to make them selfless only in certain very special circumstances and in relation to only certain classes of human beings. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- But if the Gospels tell us very little about the “I _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- not-I, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The doctrine that God is in the world...the sacredness of nature, and the sinfulness and folly of man's overwhelming efforts to be her master rather than her intelligently docile collaborator. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- The world inhabited by ordinary, nice, unregenerate people is mainly dull (so dull that they have to ditract their minds from being aware of it by all sorts of artificial 'amusements') sometimes briefly and intensely pleasurable, occasionally or quite often disagreeable and even agonizing. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- ...the Perennial Philosophy will do something to preserve men and women from the temptation to idolatrous worship of things in time- church-worship, state-worship, revolutionary future-worship, humanistic self-worship, all of them essentially and necessarily opposed to charity. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- To sum up, that mortification is the best which results in the elimination of self-will, self-interest, self-centered thinking, wishing and imagining...which means, in practice, refraining from about fifty percent of ordinary conversations...to achieve a 'holy indifference' to the temporal success or failure of the cause to which one has devoted one's best energies. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Those who choose the profession of artist, philosopher, or man of science, choose, in many cases, a life of poverty and unrewarded hard work. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- ...the critical philosophy must mortify his commonsense... _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The verbal statements of theology's more or less adequate rationalizations of experience have been taken too seriously and treated with reverence that is due only to the Fact they are intended to describe. It has been fancied that souls are saved if assent is given to what is logically regarded as the correct formula, lost if it is withheld. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Most human beings are not philosophers and care not at all for consistency in thought or action. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The orthodox doctrine of the Atonement attributes to God characteristics that would be discredible even to a human potentate, and its model of the universe is not the product of spiritual insight rationalized by philosophical reflection, but rather the projection of a lawyer's phantasy. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- For the Buddha of the Pali scriptures, ritual was one of the fetters holding back the soul from enlightenment and liberation. Nevertheless, the religion he founded has made full use of ceremonies, vain repetitions and sacramental rites. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- In academic circles, and among those who have been subjected to higher education, there are few fetishists and few devout contemplatives; but the enthusiastic devotees of some form of political or social idolatry are as common as blackberries. _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- Self-reroach is painful; but the very pain is a reassuring proof that the self is still intact: so long as attention is fixed on the delinquent ego, it cannot be fixed upon God... _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- It is permissible to seek God provisionally under a form which is from the first recognized as merely a symbol of Reality, and a symbol which must sooner or later be discarded in favour of what it stands for. To seek Him under a settled form – settled because regarded as the very shape of Reality – is to commit onself to illusion and a kind of idolatry. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- Probably all persons, even the most saintly, suffer to some extent from distractions...make use of distractions. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Beliefs _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Arbitrarily, because it happens to be convenient, because his methods do not allow him to deal with the immense complexity of reality, he selects from the whole of experience only those elements which can be weighed, measured, numbered, or which lend themselves in any other way to mathematical treatment. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- If it is legitimate to torment and kill in one set of circumstances, it must be equally legitimate to torment and kill in all other circumstances. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- First Bach fugues, a bore...But training changes the structure of our spiritual experiences. In due course, contact with an obscurely beautiful poem, an elaborate piece of counterpoint or of mathematical reasoning, causes us to feel direct intuitions of beauty and significance. _(REN: 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- Systematic training in recollection and meditation makes possible the mystical experience, which is a direct intuition of ultimate reality. _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- The direct intuition of an impersonal spiritual reality, underlying all being, is in accord with the findings of the majority of the world's philosophers. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- If he is to transcend the limitations of man's private universe he must be a member of a community which gives him protection against the inclemencies of the environment and makes it easy for him to supply his physical wants. But this is not enough. He must also train himself in the art of being dispassionate and disinterested, must cultivate intellectual curiosity for its own sake and not for what he, as an animal, can get out of it. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Only the disinterested mind can transcend commonsense and pass beyond the boundaries of animal or average-sensual human life. The mystic exhibits disinterestedness in the highest degree possible to human beings and is therefore able to transcend ordinary limitations more completely than the man of science, the artist or the philosopher. _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- We fail to attend to our true relations with ultimate reality and, through ultimate reality, with our fellow beings, because we prefer to to attend to our animal nature and to the business of getting on in the world. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
