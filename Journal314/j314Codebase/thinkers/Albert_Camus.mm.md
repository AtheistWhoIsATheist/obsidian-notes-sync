# Albert Camus — Universal Nihilism Markmap
## (Unclassified)
- A man who has become conscious of the absurd is forever bound to it. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- Begins _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- “Men, too, secrete the inhuman. At certain moments of lucidity, the mechanical aspect of their _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- “Let us pause here. If I hold to be true that absurdity that determines my relationship with life, if I become thoroughly imbued with that sentiment that seizes me in face of the world's _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- That existence which, suddenly and through a blind act of human confidence, explains everything, he defines as _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- is the metaphysical state of the conscious man, does not lead to God.” _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- What would life be? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Suicide, like the leap, is acceptance at its extreme. Everything is over and man returns to his essential history. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- “The workman of today works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is no less _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- “Thus, for Chestov acceptance of the absurd is contemporaneous with the absurd itself. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- Being aware of it amounts to accepting it, and the whole logical effort of his thought is to bring it out so that at the same time the tremendous hope it involves may burst forth. Let me repeat that this attitude is legitimate.” _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- ...like those of Kafka, Kierkegaard, or Chestov...They embrace the God that consumes them. It is through humility that hope enters in. For the absurd of this existence assures them a little more of supernatural reality. If the course of this life leads to God, there is an outcome after all. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
## Epistemological Rupture
- gestures, their meaningless pantomime makes silly everything that surrounds them. A man is talking on the telephone behind a glass partition; you cannot hear him, but you see his _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- We must despair of ever reconstructing the familiar, calm surface which would give us peace of heart. After so many centuries of inquiries, so many abdications among thinkers, we are well aware that this is true for all our knowledge. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- scenes, with that lucidity imposed on me by the pursuit of a science, I must sacrifice everything to these certainties and I must see them squarely to be able to maintain them. Above all, I must adapt my behavior to them and pursue them in all their consequences. I am speaking here of decency. But I want to know beforehand if thought can live in those deserts.” _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- For him (Kierkegaard), too, antinomy and paradox become criteria of the religious. Thus, the very thing that led to despair of the meaning and depth of this life now gives it its truth and its clarity. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Within the limits of the human conditon, what greater hope than the hope that allows an escape from that condition? As I see once more, existential thought in this regard (and contrary to current opinion) is steeped in a vast hope. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
## Ethical Collapse
- “Nothing more profound, for example, than Kierkegaard's view according to which despair is not a fact but a state: the very state of sin. For sin is what alienates from God. The absurd, which _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 2. Abyssal Experience)_
## Linguistic Futility
- scenes, with that lucidity imposed on me by the pursuit of a science, I must sacrifice everything to these certainties and I must see them squarely to be able to maintain them. Above all, I must adapt my behavior to them and pursue them in all their consequences. I am speaking here of decency. But I want to know beforehand if thought can live in those deserts.” _(REN: (Unassigned))_
## Ontological Abyss

- If man had no eternal consciousness, if, at the bottom of everything, there were merely a wild, seething force producing everything, both large and trifling, in the storm of dark passions, if the bottomless void that nothing can fill underlay all things, what would life be but despair? _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- despair. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- The absurd man thus catches sight of a burning and frigid, transparent and limited universe in which nothing is possible but everything is given, and beyond which all is collapse and nothingness. He can then decide to accept such a universe and draw from it his strength, his refusal to hope, and the unyielding evidence of a life without consolation. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- (Kafka) His work is universal (a really absurd work is not universal) to the extent to which it represents the emotionally moving face of a man fleeing humanity, deriving from his contradictions reasons fro believing, reasos for hoping from his fecund despairs, and calling life his terrifying apprenticeship in death. It is universal because its inspiration is religious. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 2. Abyssal Experience)_
## Teleological Paradox
- But simultaneously he situates himself in relation to time. He takes his place in it. He admits that he stands at a certain point on a curve that he acknowledges having to travel to its end. He belongs to time, and by the horror that seizes him, he recognizes his worst enemy. Tomorrow, he was longing for tomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it. That revolt of the flesh is the absurd.” _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
