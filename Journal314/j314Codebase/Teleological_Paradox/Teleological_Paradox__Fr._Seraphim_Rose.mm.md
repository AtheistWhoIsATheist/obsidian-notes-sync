# Teleological Paradox — Fr. Seraphim Rose
## Quotes (REN-tagged)
- And indeed the Christian is, in a certain sense--in an ultimate sense--a "Nihilist"; for to him, in the end, the world is nothing, and God is all. This is, of course, the precise opposite of the Nihilism we have examined here, where God is nothing and the world is all; that is a Nihilism that proceeds from the Abyss, and the Christian's is a "Nihilism" that proceeds from abundance. The true Nihilist places his faith in things that pass away and end in nothing; all "optimism" on this foundation is clearly futile. The Christian, renouncing such vanity places his faith in the one thing that will not pass away, the Kingdom of God. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- Why do men learn through pain and suffering, and not through pleasure and happiness? Very simply, because pleasure and happiness accustom one to satisfaction with the things given in this world, whereas pain and suffering drive one to seek a more profound happiness beyond the limitations of this world. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- In the Christian order all activity in this life is viewed and judged in the light of the life of the future world, the life beyond death which will have no end. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- No one has rightly sought the truth who has not encountered at the end of this search-whether to accept or reject Him-our Lord, Jesus Christ, "the Way, the Truth, and the Life," Truth that stands against the world and is a reproach to all worldliness. The Liberal, who thinks his universe secure against this Truth, is the "rich man" of the parable, overburdened by his worldly interests and ideas, unwilling to give them up for the humility, poverty, and lowliness that are the marks of the genuine seeker after truth. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- Is it correct to call such a philosophy Nihilism? More precisely, is it Nihilism in the sense in which we have defined that term? If truth is, in the highest sense, knowledge of the beginning and end of things, of the dimension of the absolute; and if Nihilism is the doctrine that there is no such truth; then it is clear that those who take scientific knowledge for the only truth, and deny what ties above it, are Nihilists in the exact sense of that term. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- Communist doctrine affirms...the systematized absurdity of a perfectly efficient machine that has no ultimate purpose. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- ...let me before I call it a Christian act—carefully ask myself whether its end is merely a lofty worldly ideal, or something greater. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
