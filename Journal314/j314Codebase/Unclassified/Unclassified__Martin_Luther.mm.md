## Quotes (REN-tagged)
- Works are not condemned, but devalued because they are Earthly. The only thing that maters is not of this earth, is not of this Kingdom, God, faith in God, contemplation, non-movement, pacifism, renouncement of the Earthly for the Other, etc. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_

- Therefore the moment you begin to have faith you learn that all things in you are altogether blameworthy, sinful, and damnable... _(REN: (Unassigned))_

- -Bondage of the Will – (me- Luther has to 'diminish' free will since anything to do with free will is necessarily Earthly, and God, or the Other, is not only valuable, but the Ground of all Value. He pushes a rejection of self, for some form of unity between the Self and God) _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- Unless we are to suppose that if I should at any time be taken and cast into a prison or a sink, (which has happened to many saints,) I could not there call upon God, or believe that He was present with me, until I should come into some ornamented church. If you teach us that we are thus to trifle concerning God, and if you are thus offended at the places of His essential presence, by and by you will not even allow that He dwells with us in Heaven. _(REN: (Unassigned))_

- Wherefore, it is no wonder in divine things, that through so many ages, men renowned for talent remained blind. It might have been a wonder in human things, but in divine things, it would rather have been a wonder if there had been one here and there that did not remain blind: that they all remained utterly blind alike, is no wonder at all. For what is the whole human race together, without the Spirit, but the kingdom of the devil (as I have said) and a confused chaos of darkness? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- But how much better is it to lose the whole world, than to lose God the Creator of the world, who can create innumerable worlds again, and is better than infinite worlds? For what are temporal things when compared with eternal? This leprosy of temporal things, therefore, is rather to be borne, than that every soul should be destroyed and eternally damned, and the world kept in peace, and preserved from these tumults, by their blood and perdition: whereas, one soul cannot be redeemed with the price of the whole world! _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
