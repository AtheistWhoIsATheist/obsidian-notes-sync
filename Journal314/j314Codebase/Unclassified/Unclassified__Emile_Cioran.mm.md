- unecstatic burst of light preserving the calm of luminous eternity. far from the concentrations of ecstasy, it would be all graceful lightness and smiling warmth. The entire world should float in this dream of light, in this transparent and unreal state of delight. obstacles and matter, form and limits would cease to exist. then let me die of light in such a landscape.” _(REN: 3.

Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_

- all efforts to attain happiness, on the other hand, are entirely futile. you can not retrace your steps once you've taken the path to unhappiness; it is the path of no return. from being happy, one can become unhappy, so there are more unpleasant surprises in happiness than in unhappiness. the world seems right to us when we are happy; when unhappy, we wish the world were anything but what it is. though fully aware that the source of unhappiness is in us, we nevertheless turn a personal defect into a metaphysical deficiency. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- sees itself in other lives as if in so many mirrors; for a psychologist, all men are fragments of himself...quickly exhausting men and their limited resources, the psychologist is easily bored, for he is not naive enough to have friends and is too self-conscious to have lovers.” _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- madness _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- madness _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- I would not want to live in a world drained of all religious feeling. I am not thinking of faith but of that inner vibration which, independent of any belief in particular, projects you into, and sometimes above God. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- If the narrative of the Fall is so striking, it is because its author describes neither entities nor symbols: he sees a God strolling in a garden, a rural God, as one exegete has so accurately characterized Him. _(REN: 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- To detest someone is to want him to be anything but what he is. T. writes me that I am the man he loves most in the world . . . but he urges me at the same time to forgo my obsessions, to change my ways, to become different, to break with the man I am. Which is to say that he rejects my being. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- To be is to be cornered. _(REN: (Unassigned))_

- The apparition of life? A temporary madness, a prank, a whim of the elements, a vagary of matter. The only ones entitled to grumble are the individual beings, pitiable victims of a passing fancy. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- The only profound thinkers are the ones who do not suffer from a sense of the ridiculous. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- In my childhood, a profound shock when I heard my father, back from the cemetery, tell how a young mother who had lost her baby daughter burst out laughing at the moment the coffin was lowered into the grave. Fit of madness? Yes and no. For when we attend a funeral and the absolute deception is suddenly unmasked, do we not have a craving to react precisely like that mother? It is too much— it is almost a provocation: nature exaggerates. We conceive that we might collapse in hilarity. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- We are all of us in error, the humorists excepted. They alone have discerned, as though in jest, the inanity of all that is serious and even of all that is frivolous. _(REN: (Unassigned))_

- Everything that happens is at once natural and inconceivable. This conclusion is unavoidable, whether we consider great or trivial events. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Undeniable sign of spiritual nonfulfillment: every passionate reaction to blame, that twinge at the heart whenever we are reproached in one way or another. This is the cry of the old Adam in each of us, it proves we have not yet conquered our origins. So long as we do not aspire to be scorned, we are like the others, like those precisely whom we scorn. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- We regret not having had the courage to make such and such a decision; we regret much more having made one— any one. Better no action than the consequences of an action! _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- Everyone is mistaken, everyone lives in illusion. At best, we can admit a scale of fictions, a hierarchy of unrealities, giving preference to one rather than to another; but to choose, no, definitely not that... _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- To that friend who tells me he is bored because he cannot work, I answer that boredom is a higher state, and that we debase it by relating it to the notion of work. _(REN: (Unassigned))_

- A terrible yet endurable mortification: to be born among a people that will never be mentioned. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Existence = Torment. The equation seems obvious to me, but not to one of my friends. How to convince them? I cannot lend him my sensations; yet only they would have the power to persuade him, to give him that additional dose of ill-being he has so insistently asked for all this time. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The West: a sweet-smelling rottenness, a perfumed corpse. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- ...Do we think of Buddha withdrawing from the world on account of his contemporaries? _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Life would become endurable only among a humanity which no longer have any illusions in reserve, a humanity completely disabused and delighted to be so. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Explosive force of any mortification. Every vanquished desire affords us power. We have the more hold over this world the further we withdraw from it, the less we adhere to it. Renunciation confers an infinite power. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- 'All is suffering' – modernized, the Buddhist expression runs: 'All is nightmare.' _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Beatitude is not compatible with this world. It is for beatitude that the hermit cuts all his moorings, for beatitude that he destroys himself. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- All our beliefs being intrinsically superficial and governing only appearances, it follows that all are on the same level, at the same degree of unreality. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Every day we should honor someone, creature or object, by renouncing them. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- Thought, too, is a prejudice, a shackle. It liberates only at the beginning, when it permits us to break certain moorings; afterwards, all it is capable of is to adsorb our energy and to paralyze our impulses toward liberation. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- We cling to anything, if only we don't have to tear ourselves away from that fascination accountable for our actions and even our nature, from that primal dazzle which keeps us from discerning the nonreality in everything. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- It is a mistake to supposed that mysticism derives from a softening of the instincts, from a compromised vitality...To get a sense of them, imagine a Hernando Cortez in the middle of an invisible geography. The German mystics were conquerors too. _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- If you believe in God, you are mad without having gone mad. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- Only by thinking about him constantly and mercilessly, only by setting siege to his solitude can we win rich spoils in our battle with him. If we lose heart and go halfway only, he will just be one more failure. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Theology is the negation of divinity. Looking for proofs of God is crazy idea...theology is the atheist's mode of believing. The most obscure mystical mumbo-jumbo is closer to God than the Summa Theologiae. _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- Bach's music is the medium of heavenly transfiguration. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Wine has brought men closer to God than theology. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- For an ancient philosopher or a medieval monk, 'there is no way out' would make a constant theme for meditation. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Saintly meditation is an imprisonment in original memory. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The organ is an instrument which makes palpable God's distance from us. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- There comes a moment in life when one places everything in relation to God. Anything less seems too little. Yet the fear that God may no longer be topical sometimes grabs you, and relating everything to him seems useless. The transience of the ultimate principle – a logically absurd idea, yet present in consciousness – fills you with strange terror. Could God be just a fashion of the soul, a fleeting passion of history? _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- The more time has disappeared from one's memory, the closer one is to mysticism. Paradise is not possible without a defective memory. The healthier the memory is, the more it adheres to the world. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- Saints are completely out-of-date. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- God nestles in spiritual voids. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Saintliness cannot exist without the voluptuousness of pain and a perverse refinement of suffering. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Each time weariness with the world takes on a religious form, God appears like a sea of forgetfulness. Drowning in God is a refuge from our own individuality. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- As long as you are busy with him you have an excuse for sadness and solitude. God? An official madness. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_

- Life is a series of obsessions that one must do away with. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- To have faith one must remain passive vis-a-vis the world. The believer must not do anything. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Disagreement is a sign of spiritual vitality. It culminates in disagreement with God. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- I have always wondered about people who are 'crazy for God,' who have sacrificed everything for him, first of all their minds. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Thinking is not exhaustive; there are infinite variations on the theme of God. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Intimations of God's supreme indifference render man's revolt utterly pointless. To be a hero only in the eyes of men is a paltry thing. There is no consolation in dying like a hero, i.e. misunderstood by the gods. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- There are many thinkers and dreamers who never feel the need for God. Sadness without the need for consolation does not guarantee a religious experience. Those limited to sadness per se are strangers to God. The absolute is a specific tonality of sadness. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The task of a solitary man is to be even more solitary. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- God...is he anything but the fateful moment when our life totters on the brink of destruction? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Churches are undercover hospices. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Only ecstasy cures us of pessimism. Life would be unbearable if it were real. As a dream, it is a mixture of charm and terror to which we gladly abandon ourselves. Consciousness is nature's nightmare. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- The company of mortals is, for a lucid man, pure torture. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- I live on what makes other people die _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_

- The fall – emblem of our human condition – is a nervous exacerbation of consciousness. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- All that adheres to this world is trivial. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Voluntary hunger is a road to heaven; hunger from poverty, a crime of the earth. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- When I realized there was no absolute except in renunciation, I dedicated myself to appearances. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Sometimes God is so easy to make out that just listening a bit more carefully to one's inner voice is enough. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Spirit means renunciation...when people, not having experienced spiritual torture, satisfy their thirst for renunciation through a derivative: heroism. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Intimations of God's supreme indifference render man's revolt utterly pointless. To be a hero only in the eyes of men is a paltry thing. There is no consolation in dying like a hero, i.e., misunderstood by the gods. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The more bored one is, the more self-conscious. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Boredom is the only argument against immortality. From it derive all our negations. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Life is a reality only for wholesome people, high priests of stupidity! _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- We are not when we are one with the world. Our desire to escape the world and thus be ourselves sends us on a quest for suffering. Asceticism is the paroxysm of such desire, a systematic insomnia and starvation. Self-torture intensifies subjectivity...Once you have tasted the joys of suffering, you are hooked on them for ever. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- When you become prey to an incurable boredom, illness seems a welcome distraction. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- ..detachment from worldly things, a precondition for attachment to God. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Only ecstasy cures us of pessimism. Life would be unbearable if it were real. As a dream, it is a mixture of charm and terror to which we gladly abandon ourselves. Consciousness is nature's nightmare. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- As long as I live I shall not allow myself to forget that I shall die... _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- While reading subtle and useless philosophical polemics at the library, an irresistible longing for the desolation of deserts would sometimes grab hold of me. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Man either loses himself in God or taunts him, but no one has ever remained level-headed in his presence. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- All that is Life in me urges me to give up God. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The dead center of existence: when it is all the same to you whether you read a newspaper article or think of God. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Truly, everything can be used as argument for or against him, because everything in the world both confirms and denies his divinity. Blasphemy and prayer are both justified. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- The fall – emblem of our human condition – is a nervous exacerbation of consciousness. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Paleontology _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- flesh _(REN: (Unassigned))_

- Today, an edulcorated religion adheres only to “nice _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- ...the monk...No one would gainsay the fact that he is in the process of disappearing. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Every concerted pursuit, even that of nirvana, if we are not free to abandon it, is a shackle as much as any other. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- The world which causes it is reduced to a transitory assemblage of unreal elements. In short, our fear is intense in proportion as we give credence to the self and to the world...Only our triumph over things is real, only our realization of unreality, which our acumen constructs every day, every hour. To be delivered is to rejoice in this unreality, to seek it out each moment. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
