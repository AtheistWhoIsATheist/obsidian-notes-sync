- If a philosopher is not a man, he is anything but a philosopher; he is above all a pedant, and a pedant is a caricature of a man. The cultivation of any branch of science—of chemistry, of physics, of geometry, of philology—may be a work of differentiated specialization, and even so only within very narrow limits and restrictions; but philosophy, like poetry, is a work of integration and synthesis, or else it is merely pseudo-philosophical erudition. _(REN: 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- These clever-witted, effectively stupid persons are won't to say that it is useless to seek to delve in the unknowable or to kick against the pricks. It is as if one should say to a man whose leg has had to be amputated that it does not help him at all to think about it. And we all lack something; only some of us feel the lack and others do not. Or they pretend not to feel the lack, and then they are hypocrites. _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_

- ...the philosopher is a man before he is a philosopher, he must needs live before he can philosophize, and, in fact, he philosophizes in order to live. And usually he philosophizes either in order to resign himself to life, or to seek some finality in it, or to distract himself and forget his griefs, or for pastime and amusement. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Whence do I come and whence comes the world in which and by which I live? Whither do I go and whither goes everything that environs me? What does it all mean ? Such are the questions that man asks as soon as he frees himself from the brutalizing necessity of labouring for his material sustenance. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- If we all die utterly, wherefore does everything exist? Wherefore? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The effort to comprehend it causes the most tormenting dizziness. We cannot conceive ourselves as not existing. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Before this terrible mystery of mortality, face to face with the Sphinx, man adopts different attitudes and seeks in various ways to console himself for having been born. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The vital consequence of rationalism would be suicide. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- Positivism inducted us into an age of rationalism—that is to say, of materialism, mechanism, or mortalism; and behold now the return of vitalism, of spiritualism. What was the effort of pragmatism but an effort to restore faith in the human finality of the universe? _(REN: 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- If of two men, _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- one prays to the true God without sincerity of heart, and the other prays to an idol with all the passion of an infinite yearning, it is the first who really prays to an idol, while the second really prays to God. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- What is certain is that for thinking believers to-day, faith is, before all and above all, wishing that God may exist. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- He who affirms a faith built upon a basis of uncertainty does not and cannot lie. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The consciousness that everything passes away, that we ourselves pass away, and that everything that is ours and everything that environs us passes away, fills us with anguish, and this anguish itself reveals to us the consolation of that which does not pass away, of the eternal, of the beautiful. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- We ought to ask God to make us conscious of ourselves in ourselves, in our suffering. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Suffering is a spiritual thing. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Consciousness, the craving for more, more, always more, hunger of eternity and thirst of infinity, appetite for God—these are never satisfied. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- And we must spiritualize everything. And this we shall accomplish by giving our spirit, which grows the more it is distributed, to all men and to all things. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- What is religion? In what does it differ from the religious sense and how are the two related? Every man's definition of religion is based upon his own inward experience of it rather than upon his observation of it in others, nor indeed is it possible to define it without in some way or another experiencing it. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Religion is better described than defined and better felt than described. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- May it not be that the very condition which makes our eternal union with God thinkable destroys our longing? What difference is there between being absorbed by God and absorbing Him in ourself ? Is it the stream that is lost in the sea or the sea that is lost in the stream ? It is all the same. Our fundamental feeling is our longing not to lose the sense of the continuity of our consciousness, not to break the concatenation of our memories, the feeling of our own personal concrete identity, even though we may be gradually being absorbed in God, enriching Him. _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
