## Quotes (REN-tagged)
- The Tao that can be described is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, this brings its evil on itself. When the work is done, and one's name is becoming distinguished, to withdraw into obscurity is the way of Heaven. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the Equable.' We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the Inaudible.' We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name it 'the Subtle.' With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain The One. Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure. Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again returns and becomes nothing. This is called the Form of the Formless, and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and Indeterminable. We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see its Back. When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct the things of the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old in the beginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of Tao. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- There was something undefined and complete, coming into existence before Heaven and Earth. How still it was and formless, standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in no danger (of being exhausted)! It may be regarded as the Mother of all things. I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao (the Way or Course). Making an effort (further) to give it a name I call it The Great. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Simplicity without a name Is free from all external aim. With no desire, at rest and still, All things go right as of their will. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them complete. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing (with a purpose). There are few in the world who attain to the teaching without words, and the advantage arising from non-action. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- He who knows (the Tao) does not (care to) speak (about it); he who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it…He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals (of his nostrils). He will blunt his sharp points and unravel the complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others). This is called 'the Mysterious Agreement.' _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise them. There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce). It is because they do not know these, that men do not know me. They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to be prized. It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth, while he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom. _(REN: 3.
