# Linguistic Futility — Paul Tillich
## Quotes (REN-tagged)
- “'Ecstasy' means standing 'outside of oneself'- without ceasing to be oneself. (One of the Nihilist speaks of the objectivity one gets from Nihilism, I say this in my journals, I just need to find the entry date, also that quote from 'solitude' is exactly this experience. Although all alone, you have a sense of something bigger that is connected with yourself and everyone else, Shrooms, cannabis, entheogens) _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- All speaking about divine matters which is not done in the state of ultimate concern is meaningless. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- ...the concept of the holy was changed. Holiness becomes justice and truth. It is creative and not destructive. The true sacrafice is obedience to the law. This is the line of thought which finally led to the identification of holiness with moral perfection. But when this point is reached, holiness loses its meaning as the 'sperated', the 'transcending', the 'fascinating and terrifying', the 'entirely other'. All this is gone, and the holy has become the morally good and the logically true. It has ceased to be the holy in the genuine sense of the word. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- Religiously speaking, God transcends his own name. This is why the use of his name easily becomes an abuse or blasphemy. Whatever we say about that which concerns us ultimately, whether or not we call it God, has a symbolic meaning. _(REN: 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- Here again it would be meaningless to ask whether one or another of the figures in which an ultimate concern is symbolized does 'exist.' If 'existence' refers to something which can be foiund withing the whole of reality, no divine being exists. The question is not this, but: which of the numerable symbols of faith is most adequate to the meaning of faith? In other words, which symbol of faith ultimately expresses the ultimate without idolatrous elements? _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- Literalism deprives God of his ultimacy and, religiously speaking, of his majesty. It draws him down to the level of that which is not ultimate, the finite and conditional. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- This jar of water, this piece of bread, this cup of wine, this tree, this movement of the hands, of the knees, this building, this river, this color, this word, this book, this person is a bearer of the holy. In them faith experiences the content of its ultimate concern. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- As a theoretical judgement claiming general validity, it is a meaningless combination of words. But in the correlation between the subject and the author of faith, it has meaning and truth. The outside observer can only state that there is a correlation of faith between the one who has faith and the sacramental object of his faith. But he cannot deny or affirm the validity of this correlation of faith. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- They indentified the ultimate with the ground or substance of everything- the one, the ineffable, the being above being. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- But they realized that the true content of faith in an ultimate concern can neither be identified with a piece of reality, as sacramental faith desires, nor be expressed in terms of a rational system. It is a matter of ecstatic experience, and one can only speak of the ultimate in a language which at the same times denies the possibility of speaking about it. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
