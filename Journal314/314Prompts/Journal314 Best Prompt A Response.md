**Question**: How do the quotes reflect on the inherent anxiety or fear associated with human existence, especially in the context of contemplating the vastness or absurdity of life?

This is further deepened by Ernest Becker, who illustrates how human consciousness grapples with the absurdity of existence and the terror of facing an indifferent universe. The acknowledgment of life's transient nature and the void it presents creates a pervasive sense of dread, which Nihiltheism seeks to address by proposing a transcendent understanding beyond the material realm.

**Extended Analysis**:
