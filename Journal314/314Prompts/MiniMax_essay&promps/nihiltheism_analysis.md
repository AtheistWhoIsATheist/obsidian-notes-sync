# Nihiltheism: Definition, Origins, Proponents, and Contemporary Debates

## Executive Summary

This report argues that “nihiltheism” is best understood not as a settled doctrine but as a family resemblance between two related currents: (1) a modern radical theology lineage that proclaims the death of a transcendent, metaphysical God and redirects Christian faith toward immanent, historical presence; and (2) a contemporary, phenomenological framework that affirms existential meaninglessness while retaining theistic language and practices as catalytic for constructing subjective meaning. In both streams, the boundary decisions—where negation ends and affirmation begins, and how transcendence is redescribed rather than denied—determine whether the resulting position is coherence-affirming nihiltheism or a collapse into vacuity.

Historically, the apophatic (negative) theological tradition laid the conceptual groundwork by distinguishing God’s essence from God’s energies and by cultivating a disciplined unknowing that resists idolatry. This via negativa both protects divine transcendence and, when misunderstood, can be mistaken for nihilism. Philosophically, theDeath-of-God movement of the 1960s, associated with Thomas J. J. Altizer, William Hamilton, Gabriel Vahanian, and Paul van Buren, brought the tension to a head by announcing an historical event: the death of the transcendent God and the activation of Christian faith as immanent, ethical presence in the world.[^6][^5] Altizer’s corpus (e.g., The Gospel of Christian Atheism; Godhead and the Nothing) sharpened the dialectic through Hegel and Nietzsche, articulating an incarnational immanence and an eschatological faith that negates “otherness” to affirm total presence.[^2][^3][^12] Hamilton’s Christological ethic and “worldly” Christian手掌fold faith-love relation toward neighbor service, evidencing how Death-of-God motifs can be lived ethically without metaphysical scaffolding.[^4]

Carl Raschke’s critical theology and political theology extend these themes into the present, reading contemporary political disorder as a symptom of a world still shaped by the long shadow of “God’s death.” Raschke both recovers Altizer’s significance for current discourse and reframes the task as a genealogy of force, event, and secularity that calls for a theologically inflected critical practice.[^14][^13] Meanwhile, “nihiltheism” as a named framework has surfaced in contemporary informal discourse, proposing that theistic symbols operate as catalysts for constructing meaning within a horizon of ontological meaninglessness. While philosophically provocative, this usage requires rigorous vetting and should not be conflated with the academic Death-of-God tradition without clear warrant.

Theologically, a nihiltheistic posture reconfigures Christology and eschatology: the cross becomes the site of radical affirmation—suffering embraced rather than explained—and the Kingdom is present as disruptive, world-reversing ethics. The Church’s sacraments and practice can be interpreted as material timestreams that resist nihilistic closure. Philosophically, the strongest arguments for nihiltheism claim existential honesty, ethical activation, and doctrinal economy; the strongest arguments against warn of semantic overstretch, potential self-contradiction, and pastoral risk. Across these debates, apophatic thought emerges as a crucial ally when deployed as gnoseological humility rather than ontological nihilism, helping to distinguish negation (of creaturely predication) from denial (of God).[^8][^9]

This report situates “nihiltheism” within these lineages, clarifies its definitional boundaries, evaluates leading proponents and critiques, and proposes criteria for coherent usage going forward.

## Defining Nihiltheism: Concept, Parameters, and Boundaries

Nihiltheism denotes a family of positions that combine a commitment to the reality or inescapability of meaninglessness with a retained or reconstructed theistic stance. The retention, however, is not a reassertion of classical theism’s metaphysical guarantees. Rather, the divine is approached either as immanent presence (e.g., in Christ and ecclesial life) or as an emblematic, catalytic resource for constructing meaning under conditions of radical finitude. The term itself is not standard in peer-reviewed theology; its only substantive articulation located in the present review is a contemporary online framework that frames “nihiltheism” as the purposeful use of theistic symbols to generate subjective meaning amid ontological meaninglessness.[^18] Because this usage is not yet anchored in scholarly literature, the term should be handled with caution and defined with precision.

Two decisions demarcate the boundary between coherence and collapse:

- Ontological vs pragmatic affirmation of the divine. Coherent nihiltheism denies objective, intrinsic meaning in the world but allows that divine symbols, practices, and narratives can pragmatically catalyze meaning-construction. This distinction sidesteps classical theism’s metaphysical claims while retaining religious vitality.

- Apophatic caution. The apophatic tradition insists that God is beyond every creaturely predication and thus known “by negation.” It thereby nourishes theological humility and prevents idolatry. But apophasis is not nihilism: it denies our concepts, not God’s reality. Properly construed, apophaticism serves as a guardrail against conflating theological negation with ontological denial.[^9][^10]

Nihiltheism differs from:

- Pure nihilism, which denies meaning and typically denies religious truth-claims as illusory or categories to discard.

- Atheism, which denies the existence of deities; nihiltheism retains theistic language and practice as meaningful but not as grounds for objective purpose.

- Agnosticism, which suspends judgment about God; nihiltheism actively engages theistic motifs as catalytic for meaning-construction.

- Traditional theism, which posits a transcendent, providential God who grounds meaning; nihiltheism rejects metaphysical transcendence as classically conceived and reframes the divine immanently.

To clarify these distinctions, Table 1 summarizes the conceptual contrast matrix.

To illustrate these differences succinctly, the following matrix contrasts the core stances on meaning, transcendence, and ethical orientation.

Table 1. Contrast matrix across related positions

| Position             | Status of Objective Meaning | View of Transcendence                 | Ethical Orientation                                  | Epistemic Posture                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Nihiltheism          | Denies intrinsic meaning; allows constructed meaning through theistic symbols/practices | Reconfigures transcendence as immanent presence or emblematic catalyst | Activated by neighbor-love, sacraments, and eschatological hope | Apophatic humility; rejects conceptual idolatry |
| Pure Nihilism        | Denies objective/added meaning | None; often denies transcendent realities | Varies; often fatalist or relativist without anchor | Skeptical; denies religious cognition           |
| Atheism              | Denies theistic meaning      | None                                  | Secular humanist or other non-theistic frameworks    | Evidential/skeptical regarding deities          |
| Agnosticism          | Inconclusive on meaning      | Open but undecided                    | Variable                                             | Epistemic suspension                            |
| Traditional Theism   | Affirms divinely grounded meaning | Affirms transcendent, providential God | Duty/love grounded in divine command and grace       | Cataphatic/apophatic synthesis with analogical language |

As shown in Table 1, nihiltheism is not simply “theism + nihilism.” It is a discrete posture that safeguards against both metaphysical overreach and existential abdication by redescribing transcendence (as immanent presence or catalytic emblem) and by anchoring ethics in concrete practices. This keeps nihiltheism within the orbit of theological rationality while resisting nihilistic conclusion.[^18][^9][^10]

## Historical Development and Prefigurations

The lineage of nihiltheism draws from two trajectories: (1) apophatic mysticism and (2) modern radical theology, with a contemporary popular articulation of “nihiltheism” that requires critical assessment.

### Apophatic Mysticism and the “Nothing”

Apophatic theology (via negativa) approaches God by negation—stating what God is not—rather than by affirmation. Its aim is not nihilism but the purification of language and concept so that the divine transcendence is not collapsed into creaturely categories. Rooted in Neoplatonism and developed in Christian, Jewish, and Islamic traditions, apophaticism regards God’s essence as unknowable while allowing knowledge of God’s energies or self-manifestations.[^9] The apophatic tradition thereby resists idolatry and maintains a disciplined unknowing as part of spiritual ascent.

When misread, this negation can be conflated with philosophical nihilism. Recent scholarship, however, shows that apophaticism and nihilism may share a gnoseological moment—the refusal of naïve metaphysics—while diverging ontologically. Eastern Orthodox thinkers such as Christos Yannaras argue that apophaticism reorients knowledge from essence to relation, transitioning from an ontology of absence to a relational ontology where truth is participation in personhood rather than the grasping of an object. This move both confronts the nihilistic insight and surpasses it by anchoring meaning in relational being rather than void.[^10] In Islamic theosophy and Shi‘i thought, cognate motifs (e.g., taʾtīl, the denial of inadequate attributes) likewise protect transcendence and ensure that divine reality is not domesticated by human conceptuality. This is not nihilism; it is a careful theological discipline.[^8]

Apophaticism, then, provides the essential conceptual guardrail for nihiltheism: negation of inadequate predicates is not denial of God. It is a prophylactic against idolatry and a gateway to a deeper, non-objectifying knowledge.

### Death of God Theology and Radical Theology (1960s)

The Death-of-God movement arose amid cultural upheaval and intense debates about transcendence, secularity, and the public plausibility of Christian claims. In the American context, Thomas J. J. Altizer, William Hamilton, Gabriel Vahanian, and Paul van Buren became its public faces, catalyzing national discourse—down to a famous magazine cover asking, “Is God Dead?”—and provoking both outrage and appropriation.[^6][^7][^5] While their emphases varied, they shared a conviction that the transcendent, metaphysical God of Christendom had become intellectually uninhabitable for moderns, and that Christian faith must be redescribed accordingly—often as immanent, ethical presence and as the activation of the Gospel in historical life.

Altizer insisted that “the death of God is an historical event”—that God has died “in our cosmos, in our history, in our existence”—and that Christian theology must die and be reborn in that light. The dialectical “No” to transcendence becomes the gate to an emphatic “Yes” to presence: the world is not a shadow-reality but the locus of grace.[^2][^3] Hamilton’s “Death-of-God Protestantism” inverted faith-love and God-neighbor relations: faith “collapses” into love; the Christian stands beside the neighbor, sometimes “becoming Jesus” to them. It is an ethical, worldly Christianity shaped by service, technology, and struggles for justice, sustained by a hope that is neither metaphysical consolation nor a return to otherworldly religion.[^4]

Table 2 situates the movement’s timeline and emphases.

To provide a compact map of the 1960s movement, the following table profiles its principal figures, works, and positions.

Table 2. Timeline and principal figures of the Death-of-God movement

| Gabriel Vahanian   | The Death of God (1961)                               | Loss of the sacred in modern culture; call for post-Christian imagination | Early catalyst for the movement                    |
| Paul van Buren     | The Secular Meaning of the Gospel                     | Linguistic analysis; Jesus as model for secular love; immanent focus    | Academic/lay readership                        |

As shown in Table 2, the movement’s internal diversity coheres around a shared reorientation from metaphysical transcendence to immanent, ethical presence, with Altizer and Hamilton offering the sharpest theological and pastoral articulations.[^6][^5][^4][^2] The movement declined by the end of the decade, but its themes persisted in later radical theology, political theology, and post-secular discourses.[^7][^21]

### Contemporary Nihiltheism: Popular Articulations

The term “nihiltheism” has more recently surfaced in a popular online framework that integrates nihilistic honesty about meaninglessness with a functional theism: theistic symbols and practices are retained as catalysts for constructing subjective meaning without any claim to objective purpose. The framework emphasizes existential autonomy, ego dissolution, and a “transcendental otherness” encountered in confronting nothingness, redescribing the divine as an emblematic presence that elicits transformation without guaranteeing metaphysical truth.[^18]

This proposal is philosophically interesting and resonates with aspects of Altizerian immanence and apophatic humility. Yet its non-academic provenance and novel lexicon ("transcendental otherness," "ego dissolution," "emblematic presence") demand scholarly vetting. It should not be uncritically identified with the academic Death-of-God lineage nor with the apophatic tradition. Used carefully, it can name a lived orientation in which theistic practice functions as a meaning-making technology under conditions of acknowledged meaninglessness.

## Key Proponents and Their Works

Nihiltheism, as a family resemblance, draws sustenance from several thinkers whose works reimagine transcendence, confront nihilism, and recover Christian presence.

Thomas J. J. Altizer stands as the most philosophically daring voice in this lineage. In The Gospel of Christian Atheism and later works such as Godhead and the Nothing, Altizer radicalizes the Christ event as the site where transcendence collapses into immanence and where “the death of God” becomes not an atheism of denial but a baptism into total presence. Drawing on William Blake’s visionary tradition, Hegel’s dialectic, and Nietzsche’s “God is dead,” Altizer transforms the cross from a appeasement of a transcendent deity into the apex of a holy “Yes” to existence, integrating suffering rather than escaping it. The result is a Christus Victor reimagined: the divine descends into the world and saves it by affirming it totally.[^2][^3][^12][^15]

Carl A. Raschke’s contribution lies in extending this radical trajectory into the domains of postmodern theory and political theology. Raschke reads Altizer’s legacy as a catalyst for a “critical theology” suited to global crisis, linking the collapse of metaphysical theology to a broader crisis in liberal democracy and neoliberal ordering. He brings continental philosophy of religion, semiotics of the event, and political genealogy to bear on theology’s public task, reinforcing the view that the Death-of-God question is not simply historical but ongoing in our political present.[^14][^13]

William Hamilton’s “Death-of-God Protestantism” translates the movement’s negations into ethical form. Hamilton rejects the religious a priori—religion as a system that solves problems by referral to God—and inverts faith and love: faith becomes a way of standing beside the neighbor. He reads the Reformation as a movement from cloister to world, and reframes Christian existence as service to the city and its struggles, sometimes discovering “Jesus concealed” in the neighbor and sometimes “becoming Jesus” to them. Hope remains (“waiting for God”), but as ethical disposition rather than metaphysical assurance.[^4]

James L. Crenshaw’s relevance is indirect yet significant. As a leading interpreter of biblical wisdom literature, his scholarship highlights tensions with monotheism, exposes the problem of evil, and underscores the limits of traditional theodicies. While not a “nihiltheist,” his work informs the sensibilities with which any nihiltheistic Christology and eschatology must reckon: a profound awareness of suffering, the inscrutability of divine justice, and the sober realism of wisdom that refuses false comfort. This is the biblical-theological substrate against which radical theologies test their coherence.[^17]

To capture these contributions at a glance, Table 3 summarizes the proponents and their frameworks.

The following table maps each thinker to core claims and representative works, clarifying how each contributes to nihiltheism’s genealogical profile.

|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Thomas J. J. Altizer | The Gospel of Christian Atheism; Godhead and the Nothing; Radical Theology and the Death of God | Historical death of transcendent God; total immanence; dialectical Yes to existence; Blake/Hegel/Nietzsche synthesis; reimagination of Christus Victor |
| Carl A. Raschke      | Critical Theology; Force of God; The End of Theology  | Political genealogy of “God’s death”; critical theology for crisis; Altizer’s ongoing significance; event/semiotics of the religious     |
| William Hamilton     | Radical Theology and the Death of God; essays         | Faith-love inversion; Christological ethic; “worldly” Christian practice; waiting/hoping without religious a priori                      |
| James L. Crenshaw    | Old Testament Wisdom; essays on wisdom/monotheism     | Biblical wisdom and the problem of evil; theological subtlety; limits of theodicy   |

Altizer and Hamilton are explicitly programmatic for this genealogy; Raschke is its contemporary interpreter and extender; Crenshaw supplies the biblical horizon within which any nihiltheistic Christology must operate.[^2][^3][^12][^14][^4][^17]

## Theological Implications

A nihiltheistic theology must articulate how God, Christ, and Church are confessed when metaphysical transcendence is no longer credible, and yet nihilism is denied.

### Monotheism and Transcendence

Radical theology negates the “wholly other” God of metaphysical transcendence but does not necessarily negate God. Instead, it reinterprets transcendence as immanence—God is most truly present in the world, decisively in the Christ event and ecclesial life. This is not pantheism; it is an incarnational ontology where the infinite enters the finite without remainder, and where the Spirit sustains the world as the locus of grace.[^2] Apophatic theology underwrites this move by denying that our concepts capture God, thus protecting divine transcendence even as it rediress theology from essence to presence.[^9] The risk is that any re-description of transcendence can be misheard as an abandonment of divine otherness. The corrective is a disciplined apophatic humility: our immanent language names God’s self-giving, not God’s comprehensible essence.

### Christology

In a nihiltheistic register, Jesus’ cross and resurrection are recast as the decisive human act of affirmation: in the moment of abandonment, Jesus utters a “holy Yes,” transubstantiating suffering into meaning rather than escaping it. Altizer thus redescribes atonement as Christus Victor reinterpreted: the divine descends into the worst of human experience and transforms it from within, gifting “unearned grace” to the world.[^15] Hamilton integrates this with ethical imitation: Christ becomes the pattern for neighbor-love and worldliness, sometimes concealed in the neighbor, sometimes enacted by becoming Christ for the other.[^4] Both moves are consistent with the broader Death-of-God reframing: immanence replaces otherworldliness, and the cross becomes the birthplace of unconditional love.

### Eschatology

Altizer retrieves eschatological faith as world-reversing and world-consummating: the Kingdom breaks into history and dissolves the “old aeon,” demanding a radical “No” to the world that it may be recreated. The “death of God” is the context in which this eschatological faith is reborn, because the dissolution of the world’s ontological pretensions opens the way for the Kingdom’s advent.[^2] Ethically, the Church’s life and sacraments are the material timestream through which this hope is embodied: a materialist eschatology that resists nihilistic closure and locates redemption in the mending work of the Spirit, between the Crucified Christ and the parousia.[^11]

Together, these implications sketch a nihiltheistic doctrinal coherence: God is present; Christ saves by affirming; the Church practices resurrection now.

## Philosophical Arguments For and Against Nihiltheism

The debate over nihiltheism is not merely semantic; it turns on how one construes meaning, knowledge, and ethical life after the collapse of metaphysical guarantees.

Arguments for:

- Existential honesty. Nihiltheism faces the collapse of traditional metaphysical meanings and refuses to掩蔽 with false comfort. It embraces an “absolute Yes” to existence, integrating suffering rather than explaining it away, and thus preserves existential authenticity.[^15][^3]

- Ethical activation. By inverting faith-love and relocating grace to immanence, nihiltheism can energize ethical life—service to the neighbor, engagement with the world’s structures, and practices of justice and care.[^4]

- Doctrinal economy and apophatic sanity. By denying creaturely predication of God, apophatic theology cleanses doctrine of idolatry. When extended, it licenses a modest nihiltheism that retains theistic practice as participation rather than proposition, thereby avoiding nihilistic conclusion while respecting the limits of thought.[^9][^10]

- Political/public relevance. Raschke’s critical theology translates this genealogy into a diagnosis of contemporary political pathology, suggesting that the “death of God” continues to shape culture and that theology must engage the public square as event and force.[^14][^13]

Arguments against:

- Self-contradiction or vacuity. Critics contend that retaining theistic language without metaphysical content empties Christian discourse, amounting to wordmagic that conceals atheism or nihilism.

- Pastoral risk. If meaninglessness is foregrounded without robust practices of hope, despair may triumph; existential honesty must be paired with embodied practices of meaning-making.

- Misconstruing apophaticism. To conflate negation with denial is to invite nihilism; the apophatic tradition’s whole point is to protect transcendence while denying our adequacy, not to deny God.[^9][^10][^8]

- Public plausibility and moral relativism. Detractors argue that abandoning metaphysical grounding undermines shared moral norms and public Witness, contributing to relativism—an objection that requires a practical rejoinder in ethics and public theology.[^5][^21]

Table 4 maps these arguments and resources for adjudication.

To clarify where the strongest debates lie, the following table pairs representative pro and con arguments with their typical interlocutors and adjudicatory resources.

Table 4. Argument map—nihiltheism

| Side       | Representative Claims                                           | Key Interlocutors/Resources                         |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| For        | Existential honesty; ethical activation; apophatic sanity; public relevance | Altizer (dialectical affirmation); Hamilton (faith-love); apophatic tradition (Yannaras/Corbin); Raschke (political theology) |
| Against    | Self-contradiction/vacuity; pastoral risk; apophatic misread; moral relativism | Critics of Death-of-God movement; classical theists; secular critics |

The most promising nihiltheisms are those that combine apophatic humility with ethical density and ecclesial practice, thus avoiding the twin pitfalls of vacuity and despair.

## Contemporary Debates and Criticisms

Recent literature treats the Death-of-God movement not as a curiosity of the 1960s but as a catalyst for ongoing “radical theology.” Three streams are notable.

First, scholarly assessments emphasize the movement’s internal diversity and its legacy in current theology. Some interpreters trace the arc from the 1960s through deconstruction to contemporary “radical” or “post-secular” theologies that seek to speak after metaphysics.[^21][^23] This includes renewed attention to Altizer’s corpora as resources for thinking presence without transcendence, immanence without collapse.

Second, the public reception remains polarized: the movement is celebrated by some as a mature embrace of secularity and condemned by others as an abandonment of Christian truth. The media amplifies this polarization, with historical retrospectives reminding us how the “Is God Dead?” spectacle both caricatured and concentrated the stakes.[^5][^6][^7]

Third, political theology extends the debate. Raschke links the ongoing effects of “God’s death” to crisis in liberal democracy, calling for a critical theology that names the event-structuring force of religious imagination and reorients praxis.[^14][^13] Here, nihiltheism becomes not merely a doctrinal option but a lens for reading culture.

Finally, alternative orthodox critiques deploy Barth and others to argue that negative theology, properly constrained, guards the qualitative transcendence of God and thus protects the faith from both nihilism and collapsing immanence. Debates about the scope and limits of apophatic language thus continue to inform reception.[^19]

---

## Relationship to Nihilism and to Theism

From nihilism, nihiltheism borrows the courage to admit meaninglessness; from theism, it retains the language and practices that make meaning possible. The synthesis is delicate. Properly held, nihiltheism does not affirm a nihilistic ontology; it denies objective meaning while affirming the power of theistic forms to catalyze participatory meaning in human lives.

The apophatic tradition clarifies this synthesis. It insists that negation is not denial but purification—an insistence that distinguishes nihiltheism from nihilism by safeguarding the divine as beyond being while enabling participation in divine energies. This shift, as Yannaras notes, moves knowledge from the objectifying grasp to relational presence, a move that can incorporate nihilistic insights without surrendering to absence.[^10] In a different register, Corbin argued that apophatic theology functions as an antidote to nihilism precisely by maintaining the distinction between the indeterminate Absolute and the personal God, thereby securing both transcendence and personhood.[^8]

Table 5 synthesizes the continuities and discontinuities across key axes.

To render the contrasts vivid, the following table juxtaposes nihilism, nihiltheism, and traditional theism across ontological, epistemological, and ethical dimensions.

Table 5. Comparison matrix—nihilism, nihiltheism, traditional theism

| Dimension     | Nihilism                               | Nihiltheism                                               | Traditional Theism                           |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Ontology      | There is nothing从根本上; being collapses into absence | No intrinsic meaning; being is made meaningful through participation and practice | Being and meaning grounded in God             |
| Epistemology  | Denies access to transcendent truth     | Apophatic humility; knowledge as relation; symbolic efficacy | Cataphatic/apophatic synthesis via analogy   |
| Ethics        | Often fatalist or constructed ad hoc    | Neighbor-love, sacraments, material eschatology as practices of meaning-making | Divine command and virtue informed by grace  |

This matrix clarifies that nihiltheism is not a halfway house but a distinct posture: a disciplined admission of meaninglessness combined with a theistic practice that catalyzes meaning under the conditions of finitude.

## Conclusion: The “So What”—From Negation to Affirmation

Nihiltheism, properly construed, names a fidelity to existence after the death of metaphysical idols. It is not an capitulation to nihilism, nor a nostalgic recovery of classical proofs. It is a decision to speak of God where we actually live: in immanence, in neighbor-love, in sacraments, and in the Church’s material hope.

Three future directions recommend themselves:

- Conceptual clarification. The popular “nihiltheism” lexicon requires academic refinement. A shared set of criteria can distinguish coherent nihiltheism from collapse: (a) a disciplined apophatic guardrail; (b) an explicit account of how theistic symbols/practices function as catalytic for meaning; (c) a thick account of ethics and ecclesial practice; and (d) a public-theological reframing that engages政治 and culture.[^18][^9][^10][^14]

- Christological and eschatological development. A robust Christology must integrate Altizer’s “holy Yes” with Hamilton’s ethic, and an eschatology must articulate material practices that resist nihilistic closure. The Church’s sacramental life is central here as the form in which hope is embodied.[^15][^4][^2][^11]

- Political and pastoral implementations. Nihiltheism’s promise lies in its capacity to address despair, activate ethical agency, and speak credibly in public. Raschke’s critical theology models a political reading; pastoral practice must model hope that is not a metaphysical opiate but a form of life.[^14][^13][^4]

By distinguishing negation from denial, and immanence from collapse, nihiltheism can contribute to a post-secular theology that neither flee the world nor forfeit transcendence.

## Note on Sources and Gaps

- The present review found no peer-reviewed sources explicitly defining “nihiltheism” as a term; the lone substantive articulation is from an online, non-academic source.[^18] The term therefore requires scholarly vetting.

- No verified peer-reviewed sources connect William H. Smith as a developer of “nihiltheism” or Death-of-God frameworks; available references indicate a different author profile.[^20]

- Direct primary texts linking James L. Crenshaw to “nihiltheism” were not found; his work on wisdom literature and the problem of evil nonetheless informs the background.[^17]

- Several secondary discussions (e.g., certain PDFs) could not be accessed; content claims based on such sources were avoided or triangulated.

- The apophatic–nihilism relation is well-tread but nuanced; sources used here ground distinctions between negation and denial in Orthodox, Islamic, and Christian contexts.[^8][^10][^9]
