# Nothingness in Ancient and Medieval Philosophical Traditions: From Non-Being and Void to Apophatic Emptiness

## Executive Summary

This report reconstructs the philosophical career of “nothingness” across two macro-arcs: ancient Greek inquiries into non-being and void, and medieval Christian engagements with apophatic emptiness and mystical “noughting.” In the ancient trajectory, Parmenides radicalizes the distinction between being and non-being, arguing that what is not cannot be thought or said and that true reality is a perfect, unmoving, singular whole; his poem’s Way of Conviction sets the horizon for later disputes about change and multiplicity. Atomists such as Leucippus and Democritus, followed by Epicurus, respond by positing “the void” as a real, existing “non-being” that enables atomic motion and the rearrangement of matter, thereby reconciling change with the Eleatic critique. Aristotle, by contrast, rejects both an absolutized non-being and an ontological void, analyzing non-being as potentiality within a robust ontology of act and potency, and grounding change as the actualization of potentialities in substances.

In the medieval arc, “nothingness” is reframed as theological mystery and mystical practice. Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite codifies a negative (apophatic) way of speaking about God: beyond all affirmations and negations, the divine is approached through unknowing, silence, and darkening of language. Aquinas then articulates creatio ex nihilo as a mode of emanation that is not change, highlighting the ontological priority of non-being (not temporally, but in the order of nature) to creaturely existence and insisting on creatures’ radical dependence on God. Mystical writers—Meister Eckhart, John of the Cross, and Julian of Norwich—translate apophatic insight into ascetical and experiential grammar: Eckhart’s “divine nothing” and birth of the Word in the soul; John’s “nada” as detachment that empties desire; and Julian’s “noughting” that discerns the littleness of creatures and sin’s non-substantial “nothing.”

Key findings:
- “Void” in ancient physics and “non-being” in metaphysics are not synonymous: the atomists treat void as a real condition of motion; Aristotle locates non-being in potentiality; Parmenides excludes non-being from truth altogether.
- Medieval apophatic traditions deny predicates of God not to deny God, but to safeguard divine transcendence and to purify language and desire for union.
- Aquinas’s creatio ex nihilo responds to Parmenides and the atomists by situating non-being within a creation theology that is not change and by stressing continuous divine conservation.
- Mystical “nothingness” advances an ascetical program of emptying creaturely attachments and conceptual graspedness to prepare for union.

Implications:
- The genealogy of “nothingness” links metaphysical rigor (Parmenides, Aristotle) with theological modesty (Dionysius, Aquinas) and ascetical transformation (Eckhart, John, Julian), shaping how later traditions understand negation, emptiness, and the limits of language and thought.

## Methodology and Source Notes

This study integrates primary textual witnesses with high-level secondary syntheses:

- Primary fragments and translations: Parmenides (English hexameter translation by Thomas Davidson); John of the Cross (standard English translations of the Ascent and Dark Night); Julian of Norwich (Project Gutenberg Middle/Modern English text). [^4] [^14] [^13]
- Secondary syntheses: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) entries on Parmenides, Ancient Atomism, Leucippus/Democritus, Aristotle’s Metaphysics, Pseudo-Dionysius, Meister Eckhart; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP) and other academic sources for contextual framing. [^1] [^2] [^8] [^15] [^3] [^11] [^18] [^19]
- Scholastic sources: Aquinas, Summa Theologiae (New Advent) and commentary tradition (e.g., Carroll & Baldner, Davies) for creatio ex nihilo; Augustine’s City of God (New Advent). [^12] [^20] [^21] [^22]

Editorial principles:
- Translation variance: Where multiple translations exist, standard scholarly editions were prioritized; occasional archaic diction (e.g., Parmenides in hexameters) is preserved and signaled.
- Cross-referencing: To mitigate doxographic layering in Presocratics, fragmentary claims are triangulated with both SEP entries and standard collections when available.
- Scope limitations: Some citations to Pseudo-Dionysius are mediated through SEP summaries; reliable public-facing translations of the Mystical Theology and Divine Names passages vary, and page-grade anchors are not consistently available. Eckhart’s vernacular sermons present German-to-English transliteration variants; sermon numbering conventions differ across editions. These are flagged as information gaps in the Appendices.

## Conceptual Primer: Varieties of “Nothingness”

Across these traditions, “nothingness” is not a single concept. It branches into at least four families:

- Logical non-being: what cannot be thought or signified (Parmenides’ excluded path), often tied to contradictions or meaningless reference. [^1] [^4]
- Physical void: a real “space” or condition enabling motion and explaining change without invoking coming-to-be from nothing (Leucippus/Democritus; Epicurus). [^2] [^8] [^15]
- Potentiality: a mode of non-being that is not sheer nothing but “not yet” actual, central to Aristotle’s ontology of change and substance. [^3]
- Apophatic/negative theological emptiness: a principled refusal to ascribe predicates to God, and an ascetical practice of “unknowing” and detachment that leads to union (Pseudo-Dionysius; medieval mystics). [^6] [^10] [^11] [^14] [^13]

To situate these families, the following map provides a concise overview.

To illustrate these distinctions, the following table maps each tradition’s sense of “nothingness” to its function and primary texts.

| Tradition | Sense of “nothingness” | Function in the system | Primary text/authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parmenides | Logical non-being | Excluded from truth; safeguards the unity and immutability of What Is | Poem, Frs. 2, 6–8 (Davidson translation) [^1] [^4] |
| Atomists (Leucippus, Democritus; Epicurus) | Physical void | Enables motion; explains change as rearrangement without absolute coming-to-be | SEP Ancient Atomism; SEP Leucippus/Democritus [^2] [^8] [^15] |
| Aristotle | Non-being as potentiality | Grounds change as actualization; preserves substances and avoids absolute void | SEP Aristotle’s Metaphysics; Book Θ analyses [^3] |
| Pseudo-Dionysius | Apophatic emptiness | Transcends all names/negations; approaches God through unknowing | SEP Pseudo-Dionysius; apophatic methodology [^6] |
| Aquinas | Ontological non-being (priority of nature) | Creatio ex nihilo as emanation—not change; radical creaturely dependence | Summa Theologiae I, q.45; commentary tradition [^12] [^20] [^21] [^22] |
| Meister Eckhart | “Divine nothing” and ground | God beyond being; birth of the Word; detachment; intellectual nothingness | SEP Meister Eckhart; CCEL Sermons [^11] [^14] |
| John of the Cross | “Nada” (nothing) | Ascetical emptying of desires; dark night of sense and spirit | Ascent of Mount Carmel; Dark Night [^10] |
| Julian of Norwich | “Noughting” | Recognition of creatures’ littleness; detachment; sin as non-substance | Revelations of Divine Love (Project Gutenberg) [^13] |
| Augustine | Privation and “veering toward nothing” | Evil as privatio boni; created nature poised between God and nothing | City of God, Bk. XIV.13; Bk. XIII (New Advent) [^9] |

These categories overlap in complex ways: the atomists’ void is a kind of existing “non-being” within nature; Aristotle’s potentiality is a structured “non-being” inside being; apophatic theology is a language of transcendence that denies predicates to protect divine mystery. Across these, “nothingness” names not simply negation but a principled account of how thought, language, and reality relate at their limits.

## Ancient Greek Inquiries: Non-Being, Void, and Potentiality

Greek philosophy initiates the most incisive queries into non-being and void. Parmenides’ poem polarizes being and non-being, atomists re-empower “what is not” as void to preserve motion, and Aristotle reframes non-being as potentiality within a teleological ontology. The friction among these positions drives the conceptual development of “nothingness” as a live philosophical problem. [^1] [^2] [^3]

### Parmenides: The Way of Conviction and the Impossibility of Non-Being

Parmenides’ goddess announces two ways of inquiry and a third mortal way that mixes being and non-being. The Way of Conviction asserts that “What Is” is ungenerated, deathless, whole, uniform, motionlessly enduring, and perfect; the path that claims “What Is not” is unspeakable and unknowable. The poem’s core moves—against generation from nothing and against change—aim to protect the unity and intelligibility of what truly is. [^1] [^4]

To anchor the analysis, the following table summarizes the attributes of “What Is” as deduced in Fragment 8, alongside concise interpretive notes.

To illustrate Parmenides’ deductions, the table below consolidates key attributes and their textual basis.

| Attribute | Fragment basis | Interpretive note |
|---|---|---|
| Ungenerated and deathless | Fr. 8.3–4, 8.5–21 | What is cannot “come to be” from not-being; generation and destruction are expelled by truth [^4] |
| Whole and uniform | Fr. 8.1–4, 8.22–5 | Being is self-similar and continuous; division would imply non-being within [^4] |
| Motionless | Fr. 8.26–33 | Change requires what-is-not; stasis preserved by Necessity’s bonds [^4] |
| Perfect and bounded | Fr. 8.26–33, 8.42–9 | Like a well-rounded sphere, complete and limit-defined; non-being does not bar equality [^4] |
| Thinkability and being coincide | Fr. 8.34–41 (via SEP analysis) | Thought requires an object; what can be thought and spoken of must be, always [^1] |

Parmenides’ critique of non-being is not a denial of the sensible world’s appearance but a claim about what can be truly known. The “mortal way” that “supposes that it is and is not the same and not the same” confuses levels of discourse and collapses the distinction between being and non-being. The goddess instructs judgment by reason rather than sense-experience. In later receptions, interpreters debate whether Parmenides denies the existence of the sensible world altogether or distinguishes an intelligible aspect (one, ungenerated) from a sensible aspect (plural, changing) in a “generous monism.” Either way, the poem’s argumentative spine establishes the constraints any subsequent account of change must meet. [^1]

### Atomists: Void as Real Non-Being (Leucippus, Democritus, Epicurus)

Atomists explicitly contradict Parmenides’ ban on non-being by granting void genuine existence. For Leucippus and Democritus, the world is composed of indivisible atoms and void; motion is impossible without void; and perceived change is the rearrangement of unaltering atoms into new clusters. Sensible qualities are conventional; atoms differ in size, shape, order, and position. [^2] [^8] [^15]

Epicurus retains atoms and void but adjusts the kinematics: atoms possess conceptually distinct parts, all perception is true (differentiating causal impacts from judgments), and the swerve (clinamen) introduces a minimal, uncaused deviation that allows collisions and preserves responsibility. Void is an infinite empty space enabling infinite cosmos and interactions. [^2]

To clarify the contrasts, the following comparative matrix highlights the commitments across the atomist tradition.

To distill these differences, the table below sets atom and void roles side-by-side.

| Feature | Leucippus | Democritus | Epicurus |
|---|---|---|---|
| Atoms | Indivisible, eternal; always in motion; indestructible | Indivisible, unchangeable; clusters form macro-objects; qualitative difference conventional | Indivisible physically; conceptually partite; swerve added to motion |
| Void | Exists; necessary for motion; infinite | Exists; “what is not” as a real condition | Exists; infinite space; enables fall, swerve, collisions |
| Motion | Requires void; responds to Zeno by positing minima | Rearrangement without generation or destruction | Innate downward tendency + clinamen; explains collision |
| Qualities | Conventional (by convention) | Eliminativist about sensible qualities | All perception true; judgments about perceptions can err |
| Cosmic model | Whirls form worlds; membranes and sorting produce stars | Informs standard atomist physics | Infinite worlds from infinite atomic interactions |

Atomists thus rehabilitate “what is not” (void) as a positive ontological constituent of the natural order, reconciling change without invoking absolute generation from nothing. Their move redefines “nothingness” as a physical condition, not a logical impossibility. [^2] [^8] [^15]

### Aristotle: Non-Being as Potentiality and the Refutation of the Void

Aristotle refuses both Parmenides’ exclusion of change and the atomists’ void. In Metaphysics Γ, he asserts the Principle of Non-Contradiction (PNC) as a first principle of discourse, but he refuses to collapse change into illusion. In Θ, he develops potentiality (dunamis) and actuality (energeia) to explain how a thing can be “not yet” what it will become, or can cease to be what it is, without invoking absolute non-being. Matter is the principle of potentiality; form and actuality define what a thing is. Change is the actualization of a potentiality, not the emergence of being from sheer non-being. [^3]

Aristotle argues for the priority of actuality over potentiality in three ways: priority in logos (definitions invoke actuality), priority in time (particulars develop from prior actual forms), and priority in substance (eternality and final causality). He denies void on physical grounds: motion would be impossible if there were no resisting medium; void removes differentiation and traction. [^3]

The following table gathers Aristotle’s key theses relevant to non-being and change.

To summarize these claims, the table below highlights central texts and their implications.

| Thesis | Metaphysics locus | Implication for non-being |
|---|---|---|
| PNC as first principle | Γ (1005b19) | Coherent discourse excludes contradictions; being and non-being cannot co-predicate in same respect [^3] |
| Potentiality vs. actuality | Θ (1046a12; 1049b4–5; 1050b6–1051a2) | Non-being as “not yet actual”; change is actualization of a potentiality [^3] |
| Priority of actuality | Θ.8 | Actuality defines potentiality; eternal actual forms ground perishable particulars [^3] |
| Unity of compounds | Η.6 | Matter (potential) and form (actual) unify in substances; intelligible matter in species [^3] |

Aristotle’s synthesis reframes non-being as an ontological modifier within being, not as a competitor principle. It underwrites a robust account of change without void, while respecting the Parmenidean insistence on the intelligibility of what is. [^3]

## Medieval Transpositions: From Apophasis to Mystical Emptiness

Medieval thought inherits Greek analyses and transposes them into theological and mystical registers. Apophatic traditions deny predicates to safeguard divine transcendence; scholastic metaphysics articulates creatio ex nihilo; mystics develop practices and metaphors of emptying (“nada,” “noughting,” “birth of the Word”) that translate negation into ascetical pathways. [^6] [^12] [^11] [^14] [^10] [^13]

### Pseudo-Dionysius: Apophatic Method and Divine Silence

Pseudo-Dionysius synthesizes Neoplatonic hierarchy with Christian liturgy and scripture. In the Mystical Theology, he charts an ascent from affirmative names (cataphatic) to negation (apophatic), culminating in “divine silence, darkness, and unknowing.” Negations are not privations but signs of transcendence beyond presence and absence; the godhead is “over-good,” “over-being,” “over-life,” etc., and remains unnamed. The theurgic symbolism—dissimilar similarities in rites and texts—guides the intellect upward by productive confusion, culminating in union beyond concepts. [^6]

To visualize the negative ascent, the following table outlines the ladder of negations and its experiential goal.

To clarify this path, the table below summarizes the steps and outcomes.

| Stage | Negated domain | Aim | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| Symbolic theology | Visible rites and images | Purify and lead to intelligible names | Recognition of metaphors’ dissimilarity [^6] |
| Intelligible names | God “over-good,” “over-being,” etc. | Affirm transcendent perfections | Deny limits and creaturely analogies [^6] |
| Theological representations | Persons and properties | Stabilize discourse about God | Prepare for apophatic silence [^6] |
| Mystical Theology | All names and negations | Transcend discourse | Union in darkness and unknowing [^6] |

Dionysius’ apophasis is not denial of God but methodological humility: by unsaying, the mind is prepared for encounter with the ineffable source beyond being and goodness. [^6]

### Thomas Aquinas: Creatio ex Nihilo and the Ontology of Non-Being

Aquinas articulates creatio ex nihilo as the emanation of all being from God, not as change within the world. Creation is not a making that works upon pre-existent matter; it is the receiving of being “after non-being” in the order of nature, not necessarily in time. Creatures are entirely dependent upon divine causality for their existence and conservation; left to themselves, they would be nothing. This radical dependence highlights God’s status as pure actuality and plenitude of being. [^12] [^20] [^21] [^22]

Aquinas insists creation is not a temporal transition from nothing to something; it is the procession of the whole substance of a thing from God. There is no “thing” prior to creation upon which God works; thus creation differs generically from change. Conservation is continuous with creation: creatures persist only by divine volition. [^12] [^20] [^22]

To consolidate Aquinas’s positions, the following table assembles key theses and sources.

To make the structure explicit, the table below lists the main claims.

| Thesis | Source | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| Creation is emanation of all being from God | Summa Theologiae I, q.45 | Not change; not from pre-existent matter [^12] |
| Non-being prior in order of nature, not time | Commentary on the Sentences (II Sent. 1.1.2) | Ontological priority of non-being to creaturely being [^21] |
| Creatures would be nothing apart from God | Scholastic commentaries (Davies; Carroll & Baldner) | Radical dependence; continuous conservation [^21] [^22] |
| God is pure actuality and plenitude of being | Thomistic metaphysics | No potency in God; creation is free, total bestowal [^20] |

Aquinas thereby reframes “nothingness” as the creature’s ontological posture apart from divine causality, safeguarding God’s transcendence while affirming the real causal efficacy of creatures within being. [^12] [^20] [^21] [^22]

### Meister Eckhart: God as “Nothing” and the Birth of God in the Soul

Eckhart’s mystical theology radicalizes apophatic insight: God, as ground, is beyond being; the divine intellect’s “nothingness” is fertile, causing things by cognizing them. The “birth of the Word” in the soul signifies intellectual union where distinctions fall away in the ground; the “spark” (vünkelin) marks the locus of divine encounter. Detachment (abgescheidenheit) and releasement (gelâzenheit) are negative virtues that empty the soul of images and creaturely graspedness, preparing it to receive the Word. [^11] [^14]

Eckhart’s metaphysics of flow (bullitio, ebullitio) describes the inner unfolding of the Trinity and the overflowing of divine fullness into creation. Creatures, considered apart from God, are “nothing”; only God properly is. Eckhart’s analogy deploys “in quantum” qualifiers to preserve divine transcendence while permitting reversible predications: what is said of God must be denied of creatures, and vice versa, in terms of proper being. [^11]

To make the doctrinal architecture accessible, the following table maps key notions to functions.

To show how these concepts cohere, the table below organizes them.

| Notion | Function in Eckhart’s system |Ascetical/spiritual aim |
|---|---|---|
| God as “no-thing” (divine nothing) | Ground beyond being; productive intellect | Humility of intellect; remove creaturely images [^11] [^14] |
| Birth of the Word | Intellectual union in the ground; paternity and sonship | Receive the Word; “listen” rather than will [^11] |
| Bullitio/ebullitio | Inner Trinitarian boiling; outward flowing of creation | Recognize divine overabundance; gratitude [^11] |
| Detachment/releasement | Negative virtues; emptiness of desire | Freedom “without a why”; bear fruit in charity [^11] |
| Analogy (in quantum) | Manage predication; safeguard transcendence | Avoid univocity; protect Creator/creature distinction [^11] |

Eckhart’s “nothingness” is not nihilism but a profound account of intellectual receptivity and divine transcendence, woven into a moral program of detachment. [^11] [^14]

### John of the Cross: “Nada” and the Dark Night of Emptiness

John of the Cross develops a rigorous ascetical phenomenology of emptiness. The “dark night” purifies desire in two movements: the active night of sense (mortifying attachment to sensible pleasures) and the passive night of spirit (purgation of spiritual imperfections and covert pride). “Nada” names the requisite detachment: desire to possess nothing, to be nothing, to know nothing, so that the soul is left free and void of appetites—even while it may still possess external goods. Darkness is not absence of God but the soul’s emptiness of its own cravings, enabling union. [^10]

To highlight the practical steps, the following table lists the main movements and effects.

To show how “nada” operates, the table below outlines the nights and outcomes.

| Stage | Appetites affected | Operational definition | Transformative effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Active night (sense) | Pleasures of sense and imagination | Denudation of tastes and desires | Freedom from attachments; clarity of will [^10] |
| Passive night (spirit) | Spiritual consolations; imperfections | God-led purgation of hidden attachments | Stabilized charity; transformed understanding [^10] |
| Union | All desires aligned to God | “Nothing, nothing, nothing” as persistent stance | Consummation in love; peace beyond understanding [^10] |

John’s language of “emptiness within itself of all things” underscores that the harm is not in external objects but in the will and appetite that occupy the soul. Purgation clears space for divine indwelling without displacing creaturely goods, but reordering them under charity. [^10]

### Julian of Norwich: “Noughting” and the Lovingly Made Nothing

Julian’s mystical theology articulates “noughting” as recognition of creatures’ littleness and the non-substantiality of sin. The hazelnut vision asserts that all things have being through God’s love, and that the tiny creation would fall to “naught” were it not sustained by love. Rest comes only when the soul is “made nought as to all things that are made,” holding them as nothing in comparison to the uncreated Good. Sin, moreover, has no “manner of substance” and is known only by the pain it causes. Julian’s maternal Christology frames God as “Very Mother,” feeding the soul with Himself in an overflow of love. [^13]

To track the motif across her text, the following table gathers representative passages and their functions.

To make these motifs tangible, the table below distills key quotations.

| Chapter/context | Quotation | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Ch. V (hazelnut) | “It lasteth, and ever shall [last] for that God loveth it.” | Creatures’ being sustained by love; otherwise “naught” [^13] |
| Ch. V (rest) | “No soul is rested till it is made nought as to all things that are made.” | Ascetical emptying for spiritual rest [^13] |
| Ch. V (prayer) | “I may nothing ask that is less… but only in Thee I have all.” | God alone satisfies; lesser things are “nothing” [^13] |
| Ch. XXVII (sin) | “Sin hath no manner of substance nor no part of being.” | Sin as non-substantial privation; known by pain [^13] |
| Ch. LIX (Motherhood) | “I am… the endless fulfilling of all true desires.” | Maternal Christology; love as metaphysical ground [^13] |
| Ch. LXXXVI (meaning) | “Love was His meaning.” | Love as interpretive key to all revelations [^13] |

Julian’s “noughting” harmonizes apophatic restraint with an affective confidence in divine love. In this light, emptiness is not despair but a sober discernment of where true rest lies. [^13]

### Augustine: Created Existence “Between God and Nothing”

Augustine locates created existence between divine fullness and nothingness. Evil is privation of the good (privatio boni), not a substance; the wicked will turns inward, “pleasing itself,” and by that very motion “veers toward nothingness” without becoming absolutely nothing. Pride—craving undue exaltation—makes the soul “less” by turning from the unchangeable good that alone truly satisfies. Created nature, made out of nothing, retains goodness but is prone to fall away; its continuity in being depends on God’s sustaining address. [^9]

Augustine’s analysis synthesizes Neoplatonic metaphysics with Christian anthropology: the moral disorder is a Diminution of goodness, not an autonomous anti-good; the path back is reattachment to the immutable good, a reorientation from self-satisfaction to God. [^9]

## Cross-Tradition Synthesis and Philosophical Implications

Nothingness in these traditions functions as a boundary-keeper: it demarcates the limits of thought, speech, and causal efficacy; it reveals what must be excluded for discourse to be coherent (Parmenides), what must be posited for motion to be possible (atomists), and what must be affirmed within being for change to be intelligible (Aristotle). Medieval thought generalizes these insights theologically and ascetically: Dionysius protects divine transcendence by unsaying; Aquinas grounds creaturely dependence by distinguishing creation from change; Eckhart, John, and Julian convert apophasis into practices of detachment and union.

Convergences and divergences:

- Limits of language: Parmenides and Pseudo-Dionysius converge on a rigorous account of the unsayable; Aristotle shifts the emphasis to definitional clarity within being. [^1] [^3] [^6]
- Negation vs. void: Atomists’ void is a productive “non-being” enabling motion; Aristotle’s potentiality is an internal non-being within being; Aquinas’s non-being is ontological dependence rather than a substance. [^2] [^3] [^12]
- Transcendence and immanence: Apophatic traditions insist God is beyond being and predicates; mystical traditions seek union that is neither denial of God nor collapse into pantheism but participation by grace and love. [^6] [^11] [^14] [^10] [^13]

To crystalize these patterns, the following matrix aligns trajectories of “nothingness” with function and outcome.

To synthesize the landscape, the table below compares trajectories and implications.

| Tradition | Function of “nothingness” | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Parmenides | Logical gatekeeper; exclude non-being from truth | Unity and immutability of What Is; constraints on change [^1] [^4] |
| Atomists | Physical condition enabling motion | Change as rearrangement; rehabilitation of “what is not” [^2] [^8] |
| Aristotle | Ontological modifier (potentiality) | Change as actualization; no need for void [^3] |
| Pseudo-Dionysius | Apophatic humility; unknowing | Union in silence and darkness; divine transcendence [^6] |
| Aquinas | Creaturely non-being (priority of nature) | Creation not change; continuous conservation [^12] |
| Eckhart | Ground beyond being; intellective “nothing” | Birth of the Word; detachment; analogical predication [^11] [^14] |
| John of the Cross | “Nada” as ascetical emptiness | Purged desires; stabilized charity; union [^10] |
| Julian of Norwich | “Noughting” as recognition of littleness | Rest in God; sin as non-substance; love’s sustenance [^13] |

Historically, this genealogy shapes later receptions: medieval apophaticism influences scholastic analogical language; mystical “emptiness” resonates with modern concerns about the limits of representation. The intellectual labor around “nothingness” ends not in nihilism but in disciplined accounts of what must be excluded, what must be affirmed, and how speech and desire must be ordered to meet the real.

## Appendices: Primary Text Excerpts and Source Map

This appendix assembles curated excerpts that were central to the analysis. Passages are chosen for clarity and fidelity to translation conventions in the cited editions.

- Parmenides, Fragment 2 (two ways; Davidson translation): “One path is: That Being doth be, and Non-Being is not… Th’other path is: That Being is not, and Non-Being must be… For thou never canst know what is not (for none can conceive it), Nor canst thou give it expression, for one thing are Thinking and Being.” [^4]

- Parmenides, Fragment 8 (attributes of What Is; Davidson translation): “What Is is ungenerated and deathless, whole and uniform, still and perfect… Nor ever from not-being will the force of conviction allow something to come to be… generation is extinguished and destruction unheard of.” [^4]

- Pseudo-Dionysius, Mystical Theology (via SEP summary): Negation transcends affirmations and negations; culminates in “divine silence, darkness, and unknowing”; the ascent moves from symbolic through intelligible names to theological representations and then beyond into apophatic union. [^6]

- Aquinas, Summa Theologiae I, q.45 (creation as emanation of all being): Creation is not change; God does not work upon a pre-existent matter; the creature’s being is “after non-being” in the order of nature, not necessarily in time. [^12]

- Meister Eckhart, Sermons (CCEL): Emptiness as attraction (hollow pipe analogy) and the “spark” of the soul as locus of encounter; emphasis on detachment from time and space and on “complete quietism” as final end. [^14]

- John of the Cross, Ascent of Mount Carmel: “In order to arrive at having pleasure in everything, desire to have pleasure in nothing… In order to arrive at being everything, desire to be nothing.” The night is “naught else than an emptiness within itself of all things.” [^10]

- Julian of Norwich, Revelations of Divine Love: “No soul is rested till it is made nought as to all things that are made.” “Sin hath no manner of substance nor no part of being.” “All-thing hath the Being by the love of God.” [^13]

- Augustine, City of God, XIV.13: Evil will precedes evil act; pride turns the soul from the unchangeable good; created nature “veers toward nothing” without becoming absolutely nothing; “to exist in oneself… is not quite to become a nonentity, but to approximate to that.” [^9]

The following table traces each excerpt to its tradition and interpretive role.

To consolidate source mapping, the table below links passages to functions.

| Augustine, City of God XIV.13 | Patristic Christian | Evil as privation; existence between God and nothing [^9] |

Information gaps and cautions:
- Pseudo-Dionysius: precise chapter/line references to Mystical Theology and Divine Names should be checked against critical editions for verbatim anchors. [^6]
- Eckhart: vernacular sermon numbering and German terms vary across editions (e.g., vünkelin); translations differ. [^11] [^14]
- John of the Cross: PDF access constraints limited page-grade anchoring; chapter-level anchors used. [^10]
- Julian: translation variance between Middle English and modern editions; quotations were aligned to Project Gutenberg for reproducibility. [^13]
- Atomists: heavy reliance on doxography and SEP reconstructions; primary fragment collections vary. [^2] [^8] [^15]
- Aristotle: in-text Bekker pagination for PNC and potentiality/actuality should be verified against critical editions; SEP anchors used here. [^3]
