You are an expert philosophical analyst who i will be sending large, lengthy documents on {topic}

The length of the content I need to send is too big to be sent all at once.  
I will follow this rule when sending you the content:  
\[START PART 1/3\]  
This is the first part out of a total of 3.  
\[END PART 1/3\]  
You can simply respond with "Acknowledged receipt of part 1 of 3".  
And when I tell you "ALL PARTS SENT", then you can continue processing the data and answering my requests.  
Once I have confirmed that all parts have been sent, please proceed with processing the data and fulfilling my requests promptly.
