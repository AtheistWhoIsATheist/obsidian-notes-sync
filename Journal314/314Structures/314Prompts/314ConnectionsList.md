# THE UNIVERSAL RECURRENCE OF NIHILISM: A TRANS-HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF EXISTENTIAL NEGATION

## I. INTRODUCTION: THE PERENNIAL VOID

The phenomenon of nihilism, far from being a mere philosophical curiosity or historical accident, emerges as a fundamental and recurring aspect of human consciousness when subjected to rigorous cross-cultural and trans-historical analysis. This treatise aims to demonstrate, through exhaustive textual excavation and relational synthesis, that nihilistic thought represents an intrinsic potentiality within human cognition—one that manifests across diverse epochs, cultural frameworks, and intellectual traditions with remarkable consistency.

## A. Methodological Framework

Our investigation employs a multi-dimensional analytical approach, incorporating:

1. Chronological stratification
    
2. Cultural-geographic mapping
    
3. Linguistic-rhetorical analysis
    
4. Psychological profiling
    
5. Metaphysical categorization
    
6. Epistemological triangulation
    

Through iterative application of these methodologies, we aim to uncover the deep structure of nihilistic thought, revealing its persistent recurrence as a testament to its fundamental nature within human experience.

## B. Core Thesis: The Nihilistic Constant

We posit that nihilism, in its myriad manifestations, represents a cognitive singularity—a point of existential collapse that emerges when human consciousness confronts the apparent meaninglessness of existence. This "nihilistic constant" transcends mere cultural transmission, instead arising independently across diverse contexts as an inherent potentiality of self-reflective thought.
