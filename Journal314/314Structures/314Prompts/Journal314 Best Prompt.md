## Example:
### 3. Lack of Objective Meaning, Value, Purpose
**Question**: How do the quotes address the notion that life lacks inherent meaning, value, or purpose, and what does this reveal about Nihiltheism? 
**Summary**: The text frequently touches upon the idea that life does not possess inherent meaning, value, or purpose. Tolstoy's reflections on the futility of worldly pursuits and the ultimate emptiness of personal achievements illustrate this lack. This perspective aligns with nihilistic thought, yet in Nihiltheism, it is the acceptance of this void that paradoxically opens the path to a deeper spiritual understanding. Journal314-A, pages 33-37.
### 4. Skepticism of Knowledge
**Question**: How is skepticism of knowledge portrayed, and what implications does it have for understanding truth within Nihiltheism? 
**Summary**: Skepticism of knowledge is evident in the text's questioning of the certainty or possibility of true knowledge. Augustine’s struggle with understanding divine mysteries and Molinos’ emphasis on the limitations of human reason in grasping divine truth highlight this skepticism.

Journal314-A, pages 1-4, Journal314-A, pages 12-16.
### 5. Limitations of Language

**Question**: How do the quotes deal with the limitations of language in expressing Nihiltheistic ideas? **Summary**: The text frequently acknowledges the limitations of language in fully capturing the essence of Nihiltheistic experiences. Molinos, in particular, discusses the ineffability of divine experiences and the inadequacy of human language to describe the profound spiritual states. This aligns with the mystical aspects of Nihiltheism, where direct experience transcends verbal articulation.

# Step 2. A Step-By-Step Thematic Exploration: "The Plan of Action"

# Introduction to Nihiltheism

Nihiltheism is a philosophical and theological perspective that explores the intersections between nihilism and theism. It delves into the existential dread, the search for meaning, and the mystical experiences that come from acknowledging the void while seeking divine connection. By drawing from the foundational text "Journal314_{#-#}", we can comprehensively explore its existential, mystical, and philosophical dimensions.

# Thematic Exploration of Nihiltheism

## 1. **Existential Dread**

**Question**: How does existential dread manifest in the writings of key historical figures, and what implications does it have for Nihiltheism?

**Summary**: Existential dread is a profound theme in the writings of Augustine, Tolstoy, and others. It reflects the inherent anxiety and fear associated with human existence, particularly when confronting the vastness or absurdity of life. Augustine’s reflections on the vanity of worldly things and the struggle between carnal desires and spiritual aspirations highlight this dread. Tolstoy's existential despair, driven by the realization of life's absurdity and the inevitability of death, further emphasizes this theme. Both perspectives underscore the need for a deeper, spiritual understanding to transcend this dread.

Journal314-A, pages 1-4, Journal314-A, pages 33-37.

## 2. **Anxiety**

**Question**: What are the different forms of anxiety discussed, and how do they contribute to the understanding of Nihiltheism?

**Summary**: Anxiety is described as a pervasive feeling of unease or worry about imminent events or uncertain outcomes. In the context of Nihiltheism, anxiety often arises from the tension between the material and spiritual realms. Molinos discusses the spiritual torment and desolation that accompany the journey towards divine union, framing these experiences as necessary trials that lead to a deeper connection with the divine.

Journal314-A, pages 12-16.

## 3. **Lack of Objective Meaning, Value, Purpose**

**Question**: How do the quotes address the notion that life lacks inherent meaning, value, or purpose, and what does this reveal about Nihiltheism?

**Summary**: The text frequently touches upon the idea that life does not possess inherent meaning, value, or purpose. Tolstoy's reflections on the futility of worldly pursuits and the ultimate emptiness of personal achievements illustrate this lack. This perspective aligns with nihilistic thought, yet in Nihiltheism, it is the acceptance of this void that paradoxically opens the path to a deeper spiritual understanding.

Journal314-A, pages 33-37.

## 4. **Skepticism of Knowledge**

**Question**: How is skepticism of knowledge portrayed, and what implications does it have for understanding truth within Nihiltheism?

**Summary**: Skepticism of knowledge is evident in the text's questioning of the certainty or possibility of true knowledge. Augustine’s struggle with understanding divine mysteries and Molinos’ emphasis on the limitations of human reason in grasping divine truth highlight this skepticism. This theme suggests that true knowledge within Nihiltheism may lie beyond rational comprehension, in the realm of mystical experience and divine revelation.

Journal314-A, pages 1-4, Journal314-A, pages 12-16.

## 5. **Limitations of Language**

**Question**: How do the quotes deal with the limitations of language in expressing Nihiltheistic ideas?

**Summary**: The text frequently acknowledges the limitations of language in fully capturing the essence of Nihiltheistic experiences. Molinos, in particular, discusses the ineffability of divine experiences and the inadequacy of human language to describe the profound spiritual states. This aligns with the mystical aspects of Nihiltheism, where direct experience transcends verbal articulation.

Journal314-A, pages 12-16.

## 6. **Dual Nature of Humans**

**Question**: What insights do the texts offer about the dual nature of humans, and how does this relate to Nihiltheism?

**Summary**: The dual nature of humans, encompassing both the finite, biological existence and the aspiration for something infinite, is a recurring theme. Augustine’s reflections on the struggle between carnal desires and spiritual aspirations, and Molinos’ emphasis on the renunciation of the self to achieve divine union, highlight this internal conflict. This theme underscores the transformative journey within Nihiltheism, where acknowledging one's limitations leads to spiritual growth.

Journal314-A, pages 1-4, Journal314-A, pages 12-16.

## 7. **Renunciation of Worldly Endeavors/Contemplative Lifestyle**

**Question**: How do the texts advocate for renunciation of worldly pursuits, and what role does this play in Nihiltheism?

**Summary**: Renunciation of worldly endeavors is strongly advocated in the texts as a path to spiritual enlightenment. Augustine’s rejection of worldly pleasures in favor of divine contemplation, and Molinos’ call for a life of inner silence and humility, emphasize the importance of turning away from material pursuits to achieve spiritual peace and union with the divine. This renunciation is a central tenet of Nihiltheism, reflecting the belief that true fulfillment lies beyond the temporal world.

Journal314-A, pages 1-4, Journal314-A, pages 12-16.

## 8. **Ego Dissolution, Authenticity, True-Self, Oneness/Union with Everything**

**Question**: How are the concepts of ego dissolution and the search for the true self presented in the texts?

**Summary**: Ego dissolution and the search for the true self are central themes in Nihiltheism.

## ChatGPt's Response

<thinking>  
1. “If thou knewest the whole Bible, and the sayings of all the philosophers, what should all this profit thee without the love and grace of God? Vanity of vanities, all is vanity, save to love God, and Him only to serve. That is the highest wisdom, to cast the world behind us, and to reach forward to the heavenly kingdom.” ("Journal314", Thomas Kempis, 47)  
2. “There is naturally in every man a desire to know, but what profiteth knowledge without the fear of God? Better of a surety is a lowly peasant who serveth God, than a proud philosopher who watcheth the stars and neglecteth the knowledge of himself.” ("Journal314", Thomas Kempis, 47)  
3. “We are too much occupied with our own affections, and too anxious about transitory things. Seldom, too, do we entirely conquer even a single fault, nor are we zealous for daily growth in grace. And so we remain lukewarm and unspiritual.” ("Journal314", Thomas Kempis, 47)  
4. “So long as we live in the world, we cannot be without trouble and trial.” ("Journal314", Thomas Kempis, 47)  
5. “If it is a fearful thing to die, it may be perchance a yet more fearful thing to live long. Happy is the man who hath the hour of his death always before his eyes, and daily prepareth himself to die.” ("Journal314", Thomas Kempis, 47)  
6. “Trust not thy friends and kinsfolk, nor put off the work of thy salvation to the future, for men will forget thee sooner than thou thinkest.” ("Journal314", Thomas Kempis, 47)  
7. “Ah, foolish one! why thinkest thou that thou shalt live long, when thou art not sure of a single day? How many have been deceived, and suddenly have been snatched away from the body!” ("Journal314", Thomas Kempis, 47)  
8. “For when thou fleest away from being abased and confounded for thy faults, it is plain that thou art neither truly humble nor truly dead to the world, and that the world is not crucified to thee.” ("Journal314", Thomas Kempis, 47)  
9. “What canst thou see anywhere which can continue long under the sun? Thou believest perchance that thou shalt be satisfied, but thou wilt never be able to attain unto this. If thou shouldest see all things before thee at once, what would it be but a vain vision?” ("Journal314", Thomas Kempis, 47)  
10. “It is better to be unknown and take heed to oneself than to neglect oneself and work wonders.” ("Journal314", Thomas Kempis, 47)  
</thinking>  
  
<analysis>

His emphasis on the transitory nature of life and the inevitability of death underlines the existential anxiety that accompanies human existence.  
  
Kempis repeatedly points out the insufficiency of earthly achievements and the constant presence of trouble and trial in the world.

The fear of death and the uncertainty of life are central to his reflections, highlighting the fragile and ephemeral nature of human existence.  
  
Moreover, Kempis's insistence on self-examination and humility aligns with the existential notion of confronting one's limitations and the ultimate meaninglessness of worldly endeavors. His advice to live with the awareness of death and to prepare oneself for it reflects the existential dread that pervades human consciousness.  
  
The repeated emphasis on the vanity of worldly things and the importance of inner spiritual life over external achievements resonates with the existential theme of seeking meaning in an inherently meaningless world.

<quote>“It is a terrifying dilemma to be in and to have to live with.” (Ernest Becker, p. 49)</quote> 

<quote>“It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an impossibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it.” (Ernest Becker, p. 50)

</quote> 

<quote>“The knowledge of death is reflective and conceptual, and animals are spared it. They live and they disappear with the same thoughtlessness: a few minutes of fear, a few seconds of anguish, and it is over. But to live a whole lifetime with the fate of death haunting one’s dreams and even the most sun-filled days—that’s something else.” (Ernest Becker, p. 50)</quote> 

<quote>“The true progress of man lieth in self-denial...” (Thomas Kempis, p. 49)</quote> 

<quote>“For a perfect contempt of the world, a fervent desire to excel in virtue, the love of discipline, the painfulness of repentance, readiness to obey, denial of self, submission to any adversity for love of Christ; these are the things which shall give great confidence of a happy death.” (Thomas Kempis, p. 50)</quote> 

<quote>“...the final terror of self-consciousness is the knowledge of one’s own death, which is the peculiar sentence on man alone in the animal kingdom.” (Ernest Becker, p. 51)</quote>

<quote>“If it is a fearful thing to die, it may be perchance a yet more fearful thing to live long. Happy is the man who hath the hour of his death always before his eyes, and daily prepareth himself to die. If thou hast ever seen one die, consider that thou also shalt pass away by the same road.” (Thomas Kempis, p. 51)</quote> 

<quote>“The kingdom of God is within you, saith the Lord. Turn thee with all thine heart to the Lord and forsake this miserable world, and thou shalt find rest unto thy soul.” (Thomas Kempis, p. 51)</quote> <quote>“It is often a small thing which casteth me down and maketh me sad. I resolve that I will act bravely, but when a little temptation cometh, immediately I am in a great strait.” (Thomas Kempis, p. 51)</quote>

It can only mean to be reborn into madness.” (Ernest Becker, p. 51)</quote> <quote>“And the crisis of society is, of course, the crisis of organized reli­gion too: religion is no longer valid as a hero system, and so the youth scorn it.” (Ernest Becker, p. 50)</quote> 

<quote>“For Kierkegaard “philistinism” was triviality, man lulled by the daily routines of his society, content with the satisfactions that it offers him: in today’s world the car, the shopping center, the two-week summer vacation.” (Ernest Becker, p. 51)</quote>

The quotes extracted from the works of Thomas Kempis and Ernest Becker reveal a profound anxiety inherent in the human condition, stemming from the awareness of mortality and the search for meaning in an absurd and transient world.

He argues that societal constructs, including religion, fail to provide lasting solace, leading to a profound sense of terror and existential dread. The analysis of these quotes underscores the shared theme of existential anxiety and the struggle to find meaning and peace amidst the transient and often contradictory nature of human existence.

8. <quote>“The knowledge of death is reflective and conceptual, and animals are spared it.

### Step 1.2: Analyzing the Quotes  
  
<Analysis>  
The extracted quotes collectively underscore a profound and pervasive anxiety tied to human existence, particularly regarding the contemplation of mortality and the inherent absurdity of life.  
  
1. **Existential Realization**: Both Kempis and Becker emphasize the human condition's awareness of death as a central existential dilemma. Kempis stresses the inevitability of death and the importance of living in constant preparedness for it, which breeds a form of existential anxiety—living with the awareness that life can end abruptly and unexpectedly. Similarly, Becker highlights the unique human capacity to reflect on mortality, contrasting it with the thoughtless existence of animals, which accentuates human existential dread.  
  
2. **Absurdity and Insanity**: Becker delves deeper into the psychological impacts of this awareness, suggesting that a full apprehension of human mortality and the absurdity of existence could drive individuals insane. This reflects an acute existential crisis where the contemplation of life’s inherent contradictions—splendid uniqueness versus inevitable decay—becomes an unbearable burden.  
  
3. **Defense Mechanisms**: Becker points out that humans construct intricate defense mechanisms to shield themselves from the stark reality of their existence. These mechanisms allow individuals to ignore the absurdity and continue functioning. He suggests that stripping these defenses would leave one facing genuine despair, indicating that much of human behavior is an effort to evade existential anxiety.  
  
4. **Perpetual Preparation and Fear**: Kempis’s advice to live in perpetual preparation for death further highlights the anxiety pervading human life. The idea that one should always be prepared for death, living each day as if it might be the last, encapsulates a profound existential anxiety about the unknown and the uncontrollable nature of existence.  
  
5. **Human Vulnerability and Fear of the Unknown**: The recurring themes in both authors’ works are the vulnerability of human life and the fear of the unknown. The unpredictability of death and the potential for sudden, unforeseen demise contribute significantly to existential dread, reflecting the fragile and transient nature of human existence.  
  
6. **Psychological Burden**: Finally, the psychological burden of reconciling one's self-awareness with the inevitability of death creates a tension that is central to existential thought. The quotes reflect a deep-seated anxiety that permeates human life, arising from the need to find meaning and stability in an inherently unstable and transient existence.  
  
Overall, the quotes from Kempis and Becker provide a multifaceted exploration of the inherent anxieties associated with human existence, particularly in contemplating mortality and the absurdity of life. These reflections capture the essence of existential dread and the psychological struggles it engenders.

### Thematic Action on {{$Theme}}, Existential Dread}}  
  
#### **Author and Quotes Extracted on Existential Dread**  
  
1. **Leo Tolstoy**  
   - "The truth lay in this that life had no meaning for me. Every day of life, every step in it, brought me nearer the edge of a precipice, whence I saw clearly the final ruin before me. To stop, to go back, were alike impossible; nor could I shut my eyes so as not to see the suffering that alone awaited me, the death of all in me, even to annihilation." [Leo Tolstoy, page 22]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=22)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=22))  
   - "I hid away a cord, to avoid being tempted to hang myself by it to one of the pegs between the cupboards of my study, where I undressed alone every evening, and ceased carrying a gun because it offered too easy a way of getting rid of life. I knew not what I wanted; I was afraid of life; I shrank from it, and yet there was something I hoped far from it." [Leo Tolstoy, page 22]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=22)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=22))  
   - "To accept life as described by Solomon and Schopenhauer, to know that it is a stupid and ridiculous joke, and yet live on, to wash, dress, dine, talk, and even write books. This position was painful and disgusting to me, but I remained in it." [Leo Tolstoy, page 24]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=24)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=24))  
   - "It might seem frightful to anyone who does not realize the nothingness and absurdity of an isolated personal life, and who believes that he will never die. But I know that my life, considered in relation to my individual happiness, is, taken by itself, a stupendous farce, and that this meaningless existence will end in a stupid death. Knowing this, I have nothing to fear." [Leo Tolstoy, pages 20-21]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=20)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=20))  
   - "It is no fable, but a living, undeniable truth, to be understood of all men. The former delusion of happiness in life which hid from me the horror of the dragon no longer deceives me." [Leo Tolstoy, page 23]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=23)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=23))  
   - "All those who had searched like myself had failed also, and come like me to the despairing conviction that the only absolute knowledge man can possess is this that life is without a meaning." [Leo Tolstoy, page 23]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=23)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=23))  
   - "We approach truth only in the proportion as we are farther from life," says Socrates, when preparing to die. What do we who love truth seek in life? In order to be free from the body and all the ills that accompany life in it. If so, then, how shall we not be glad of the approach of death? A wise man seeks death all his life, and death has no terrors for him...The only thing that remains to us is nothing." [Leo Tolstoy, pages 24-25]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=24)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=24))  
   - "Life is what it ought not to be; 'an evil, and a passage from it into nothingness is the only good in life,' says Schopenhauer. Everything in the world, both folly and wisdom, both riches and poverty, rejoicing and grief, all is vanity and worthless. Man dies and nothing is left of him, and this again is vanity, says Solomon." [Leo Tolstoy, page 24]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=24)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=24))  
  
2. **Fr. Seraphim Rose**  
   - "The whole world, it almost seems, is divided into those who lead meaningless, futile lives without being aware of it, and those who, being aware of it, are driven to madness and suicide." [Fr. Seraphim Rose, page 51]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=51)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=51))  
   - "If God is dead, if there is no immortality - then this world is all there is, and this world is absurd, this world is Hell." [Fr. Seraphim Rose, page 51]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=51)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=51))  
   - "Such is the Nihilist universe, in which there is neither up nor down, right nor wrong, true nor false, because there is no longer any point of orientation. Where there was once God, there is now nothing..." [Fr. Seraphim Rose, page 51]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=51)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=51))  
   - "In the Nihilist 'new earth' all human energy is to be devoted to worldly concerns; the whole human environment and every object in it are to serve the cause of 'production' and to remind men that their only happiness lies in this world; there is to be established, in fact, the absolute despotism of worldliness." [Fr. Seraphim Rose, page 57]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=57)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=57))  
   - "In such phenomena 'activity' is clearly an escape--an escape from boredom, from meaninglessness, and most profoundly from the emptiness that takes possession of the heart that has abandoned God." [Fr. Seraphim Rose, page 56]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=56)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=56))  
  
3. **St. Augustine**  
   - "For I wondered that others, subject to death, did live, since he whom I loved, as if he should never die, was dead. and I wondered yet more that myself, who was to him a second self, could live, he being dead. Well said one of his friend, 'Thou half of my soul'; for I felt that my soul and his soul were 'one soul in two bodies': and therefore was my life a horror to me, because I would not live halved." [St. Augustine, page 4]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=4)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=4))  
  
4. **Miguel de Molinos**  
   - "The way to attain that high state of a Mind reformed, whereby a man immediately gets to the greatest Good, to our first Original, and to the highest Peace, is his Nothingness: Endeavour, O Soul, to be always buried in that Nothingness." [Miguel de Molinos, page 9]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=9)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=9))  
  
5. **G.K. Chesterton**  
   - "Everything that we do to make our existence secure is like the act of the ostrich, when she hides her head in the sand, and does not see that her destruction is near. But we are even more foolish than the ostrich." [G.K. Chesterton, page 31]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=31)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=31))  
   - "Now it is the charge against the main deductions of the materialist that, right or wrong, they gradually destroy his humanity; I do not mean only kindness, I mean hope, courage, poetry, initiative, all that is human. For instance, when materialism leads men to complete fatalism (as it generally does), it is quite idle to pretend that it is in any sense a liberating force." [G.K. Chesterton, page 35]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=35)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=35))  
   - "The earth is so very large, and the cosmos is so very small. The cosmos is about the smallest hole that a man can hide his head in." [G.K. Chesterton, page 35]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=35)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=35))  
   - "The chief mark and element of insanity; we may say in summary that it is reason used without root, reason in the void." [G.K. Chesterton, page 35  
  
]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=35)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=35))  
  
6. **St. John of the Cross**  
   - "The doctrine of Jesus, which teaches us that we cannot possibly make life secure, but that we must be ready to die at any moment, is unquestionably preferable to the doctrine of the world, which obliges us to struggle for the security of existence." [St. John of the Cross, page 31]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=31)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=31))  
   - "The whole creation (all wisdom, sweetness, goodness, liberty, riches, etc.), compared with the infinite Being of God, is nothing; and so the soul whose chief mark and element of insanity; we may say in summary that it is reason used without root, reason in the void." [St. John of the Cross, page 38]([https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=38)](https://myaidrive.com/6BpZnWhXMyaXBqRFQRLmpA/Journal314_1.pdf?pdfPage=38))  
  
#### **Analysis**  
  
The quotes reveal a profound and multifaceted engagement with the theme of existential dread and the inherent anxiety associated with human existence, especially when contemplating the vastness and absurdity of life. This theme is essential in understanding Nihiltheism as it bridges the gap between nihilistic despair and the potential for spiritual awakening through the acceptance of nothingness.  
  
1. **Leo Tolstoy**:  
   - Emphasizes the absurdity and meaninglessness of life, reinforcing his view that life, in its isolation, is a farce that ends in a meaningless death. Tolstoy’s reflections illustrate the deep existential dread that accompanies the realization of life’s inherent absurdity.  
   - His references to Socrates and Schopenhauer underscore the philosophical tradition of viewing life as an evil to be escaped through death, which aligns with the core tenets of Nihiltheism.  
  
2. **Fr. Seraphim Rose**:  
   - Highlights how activities are often an escape from the underlying emptiness that pervades a life devoid of God. This perspective aligns with the Nihiltheistic view that worldly pursuits are ultimately futile in providing true meaning or fulfillment.  
  
3. **St. Augustine**:  
   - Reflects on the horror of living after the death of a loved one, experiencing a life that feels incomplete and dreadful. This personal account of existential dread resonates with the Nihiltheistic emphasis on the inherent suffering of human existence.  
  
4. **Miguel de Molinos**:  
   - Advocates for embracing nothingness as a pathway to achieving the highest state of mind and peace. This aligns with the mystical aspect of Nihiltheism, where the acceptance of existential dread leads to spiritual enlightenment.  
  
5. **G.K. Chesterton**:  
   - Critiques materialism for its tendency to strip away humanity's hope, courage, and other human qualities, leading to a fatalistic and nihilistic outlook. His reflections on the smallness of the cosmos and the void of reason further underscore the sense of existential dread.  
     
6. **St. John of the Cross**:  
   - Emphasizes the nothingness of the world in comparison to the infinite being of God, illustrating the profound existential dread and spiritual longing that characterize the Nihiltheistic experience. His reflections on the void and the darkness of the world align with the theme of existential dread.  
  
### Conclusion  
  
The exploration of existential dread through these quotes provides a comprehensive understanding of how Nihiltheism interprets the inherent anxiety and fear associated with human existence. By embracing the absurdity and nothingness of life, Nihiltheism offers a paradoxical pathway to spiritual enlightenment and peace. This thematic analysis reveals the depth and complexity of Nihiltheistic thought, illustrating how existential dread is both a challenge and a catalyst for profound spiritual growth.

### Step 1.1: Existential Dread  
  
**Question**: How do the quotes reflect on the inherent anxiety or fear associated with human existence, especially in the context of contemplating the vastness or absurdity of life?  
  
**Analysis**:  
  
1. **Fear of Life and Death**:  
   - "It is one thing to ritually wash one’s hands three times; it is another to wash them until the hands bleed and one is in the bathroom most of the day. Here we see in pure culture, as it were, what is at stake in all human repression: the fear of life and death. Safety in the face of the real terror of creature existence is becoming a real problem for the person. He feels vulnerable—which is the truth!" [Unknown Author, page 65-66]([https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=65).](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=65).)  
   - "Man emerged from the instinctive thoughtless action of the lower animals and came to reflect on his condition. He was given a consciousness of his individuality and his part-divinity in creation, the beauty and uniqueness of his face and his name. At the same time he was given the consciousness of the terror of the world and of his own death and decay. The final terror of self-consciousness is the knowledge of one’s own death, which is the peculiar sentence on man alone in the animal kingdom." [Unknown Author, page 48-47]([https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=48).](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=48).)  
  
2. **Nihilism and Overwhelmingness of Existence**:  
   - "Living in the world of men an impossibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it. The tragedy of life that Searles is referring to is the one we have been discussing: man's finitude, his dread of death and of the overwhelmingness of life. The schizophrenic feels these more than anyone else because he has not been able to build the confident defenses that a person normally uses to deny them." [Unknown Author, page 45-46]([https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=45).](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=45).)  
   - "It can’t be overstressed, one final time, that to see the world as it really is is devastating and terrifying. It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an impossibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it." [Unknown Author, page 44-45]([https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=44).](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=44).)  
  
3. **Madness and Isolation**:  
   - "Everything that man does in his symbolic world is an attempt to deny and overcome his grotesque fate. He literally drives himself into a blind obliviousness with social games, psychological tricks, personal preoccupations so far removed from the reality of his situation that they are forms of madness—agreed madness, shared madness, disguised and dignified madness, but madness all the same." [Unknown Author, page 38-39]([https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=38).](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=38).)  
   - "Why most people did not become insane in the face of the existential contradiction between a symbolic self that seems to give man infinite worth in a timeless scheme of things, and a body that is worth about 98 cents. How to reconcile the two?" [Unknown Author, page 38-39]([https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=38).](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=38).)  
  
4. **Depression and Guilt**:  
   - "When the average person can no longer convincingly perform his safe heroics or cannot hide his failure to be his own hero, then he bogs down in the failure of depression and its terrible guilt. Boss says that the terrible guilt feelings of the depressed person are existential, that is, they represent the failure to live one’s own life, to fulfill one’s own potential because of the twisting and turning to be “good” in the eyes of the other. The other calls the tune to one’s eligibility for immortality, and so." [Unknown Author, page 88-89]([https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=88).](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=88).)  
   - "He knows Truth and Reality, the motives of the entire universe. It was G. K. Chesterton who kept alive the spirit of Kierkegaard and naive Christianity in modern thought, as when he showed with such style that the characteristics the modern mind prides itself on are precisely those of madness." [Unknown Author, page 85-86]([https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=85).](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=85).)  
  
5. **Therapeutic Illusions and Existential Terror**:  
   - "Not everyone is as honest as Freud was when he said that he cured the miseries of the neurotic only to open him up to the normal misery of life." [Unknown Author, page 101-102]([https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=101).](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=101).)  
   - "When the average person can no longer convincingly perform his safe heroics or cannot hide his failure to be his own hero, then he bogs down in the failure of depression and its terrible guilt." [Unknown Author, page 88-89]([https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=88).](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=88).)  
  
**Summary**:  
  
The text delves deeply into the theme of existential dread, presenting it as an intrinsic part of human existence. The fear of life and death is described as a fundamental anxiety that arises from self-consciousness and the awareness of mortality. This dread is unique to humans and is highlighted through various examples, such as the obsessive-compulsive behaviors driven by fear of life and death, and the existential analysis of the Garden of Eden myth which underscores human awareness of death and decay.  
  
Nihilism and the overwhelming nature of existence are depicted as terrifying and paralyzing, making it difficult for individuals to navigate life without confronting the stark reality of their mortality. This is particularly pronounced in individuals who cannot build psychological defenses, such as schizophrenics, who are unable to shield themselves from these existential fears.  
  
Madness and isolation are recurrent themes, with the text suggesting that human attempts to create meaning and overcome their fate often result in a shared, dignified madness. The symbolic self that humans create to give their lives infinite worth is in stark contrast to the finite, fragile human body, creating an existential contradiction that many struggle to reconcile.  
  
Depression and guilt are shown as consequences of failing to live up to societal expectations of heroism and immortality. The text describes how average individuals, when unable to meet these expectations, succumb to depression and existential guilt, driven by their failure to live authentically.  
  
Finally, therapeutic illusions and the inherent terror of existence are addressed, with the text critiquing the superficial solutions offered by psychology and therapy. These practices often fail to address the deeper existential terror and absurdity of life, leaving individuals to grapple with the stark reality of their existence.  
  
The overarching insight is that existential dread is a pervasive and unavoidable aspect of human existence, deeply intertwined with the awareness of mortality and the struggle to create meaningful lives amidst an indifferent universe. This aligns with the broader context of Nihiltheism, which embraces the acceptance of this dread as a pathway to deeper spiritual understanding.

### Variety of Relevant Quotes and In-Depth Analysis

1. _**Author; Quote**:_ "It is one thing to ritually wash one’s hands three times; it is another to wash them until the hands bleed and one is in the bathroom most of the day. Here we see in pure culture, as it were, what is at stake in all human repression: the fear of life and death. Safety in the face of the real terror of creature existence is becoming a real problem for the person. He feels vulnerable—which is the truth!" [Journal314_4, pages 65-66](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=65).

_**In-Depth Analysis**:_ This quote illustrates how human actions, even seemingly simple ones like hand-washing, can become extreme manifestations of the underlying fear of life and death. The "real terror of creature existence" underscores the existential dread that is a fundamental part of human consciousness, making individuals feel profoundly vulnerable.
2. _**Author; Quote**:_ "...the best existential analysis of the human condition leads directly into the problems of God and faith... (on the Myth/Fall of Adam and Eve) Man emerged from the instinctive thoughtless action of the lower animals and came to reflect on his condition. He was given a consciousness of his individuality and his part-divinity in creation, the beauty and uniqueness of his face and his name. At the same time he was given the consciousness of the terror of the world and of his own death and decay... the final terror of self-consciousness is the knowledge of one’s own death, which is the peculiar sentence on man alone in the animal kingdom. This is the meaning of the Garden of Eden myth and the rediscovery of modern psychology: that death is man’s peculiar and greatest anxiety." [Journal314_4, pages 48-49](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=48).

_**Analysis**:_ This quote connects existential dread with the myth of Adam and Eve, highlighting the consciousness of death as a unique human trait.

3. _**Author; Quote**:_ "It can’t be overstressed, one final time, that to see the world as it really is is devastating and terrifying... It makes thoughtless living in the world of men an impossibility. It places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it." [Journal314_4, pages 45-46](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=45).

_**Analysis**:_ This quote emphasizes the overwhelming nature of true existential awareness. Recognizing the world’s reality is depicted as a terrifying experience, making it impossible to live thoughtlessly. This aligns with the theme of existential dread, portraying humans as vulnerable beings grappling with the vastness and meaning of the cosmos.
4. _**Author; Quote**:_ "Rank understood that in the face of the overwhelmingness of the world the child could not out of himself muster the stamina and the authority necessary to live in full expansiveness with limitless horizons of perception and experience... The tragedy of life that Searles is referring to is the one we have been discussing: man's finitude, his dread of death and of the overwhelmingness of life. The schizophrenic feels these more than anyone else because he has not been able to build the confident defenses that a person normally uses to deny them." [Journal314_4, pages 45-46](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=45).

_**In-Depth Analysis**:_ This quote delves into the psychological aspect of existential dread, noting how some individuals, particularly those with schizophrenia, feel the overwhelming nature of life and the fear of death more acutely. It highlights the necessity of psychological defenses to manage these fears, further underscoring the pervasive nature of existential dread.
5. _**Author; Quote**:_ "We immediately recognize this as the same creative dynamic that the person uses in transference, when he fuses all the terror and majesty of creation in the transference-object. This is what Rank meant when he said that neurosis represents creative power gone astray and confused. The person doesn’t really know what the problem is, but he hits on an ingenious way to keep moving past it." [Journal314_4, pages 66](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=66).

_**In-Depth Analysis**:_ This quote examines how people creatively cope with existential dread through neurosis. It suggests that neurotic behaviors are misguided attempts to manage the terror of existence, reflecting the underlying anxiety and confusion about the human condition.
6. _**Author; Quote**:_ "A faith which destroys reason destroys itself and the humanity of man. For only a being who has the structure of reason is able to be ultimately concerned, to distinguish ultimate and preliminary concerns, to understand the unconditional commands of the ethical imperative, and to be aware of the presence of the holy." [Journal314_4, pages 125-126](https://myaidrive.com/aEvM7jMLUEBfJceK/Journal314_4.pdf?pdfPage=125).

7. _**Author; Quote**:_ "The despair about truth by the skeptic shows that truth is still his infinite passion... The cynical superiority over every concrete truth shows that truth is still taken seriously and that the impact of the question of an ultimate concern is strongly felt... the doubt of him who is ultimately concerned about a concrete content. One could call it existential doubt, in contrast to the methodological and the skeptical doubt. It does not question whether a special proposition is true or false. It does not reject every concrete truth, but it is aware of the element of insecurity in every existential truth."
