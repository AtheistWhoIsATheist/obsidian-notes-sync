# Journal314 Universal Prompt

7/7/24 [[314Universal]]

* * *

Please craft a list of key topics that you've derived from the journal314 texts and find the quotes from those entities who are traditionally perceived as being as far away on the spectrum of agreement, whether in philosophical or religious traditions or backgrounds, and focus solely on these figures, using as many different, distinct entities as possible. The more examples given that show disparate figures stating the same sentiments, or sometimes even exact words, improves the strength of the thesis of this endeavor, which is to show not only the reality of the experience of Nihilism, but that it is a fundamental part of human existence.
