# Ontological Abyss — Schopenhauer
## Quotes (REN-tagged)
- The crowd of miserable wretches whose one aim in life is to fill their purses but never to put anything into their heads, offers a singular instance of this torment of boredom. Their wealth becomes a punishment by delivering them up to misery of having nothing to do; for, to escape it, they will rush about in all directions, traveling here, there and everywhere. No sooner do they arrive in a place than they are anxious to know what amusements it affords; just as though they were beggars asking where they could receive a dole! Of a truth, need and boredom are the two poles of human life. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_

Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- This is the realm of finality; and its opposite would be an infinite existence, exposed to no attack from without, and needing nothing to support it; Greek: haei hosautos dn, the realm of eternal peace; Greek: oute giguomenon oute apollumenon, some timeless, changeless state, one and undiversified; the negative knowledge of which forms the dominant note of the Platonic philosophy. It is to some such state as this that the denial of the will to live opens up the way. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- This is direct proof that existence has no real value in itself; for what is boredom but the feeling of the emptiness of life? _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Were it of any value in itself, anything unconditioned and absolute, it could not thus end in mere nothing. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
