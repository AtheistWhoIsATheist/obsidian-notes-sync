# Ontological Abyss — Emile Cioran
## Quotes (REN-tagged)
- “only a few can endure such experiences to the end. there is always a serious danger in repressing something which requires objectification, in locking up explosive energy, because there comes a moment when one can not restrain such overwhelming power. and then the fall is from too much plenitude. there are experiences and obsessions one cannot live with. salvation lies in confessing them. the terrifying experience of death, when preserved in consciousness, becomes _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- ruinous. if you talk about death, you save part of yourself. but at the same time, something of your real self dies, because objectified meanings lose the actuality they have in consciousness.” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- and inferior phenomenon, the product of spiritual inconsistency, failing to notice that the lyrical resources of subjectivity show remark able freshness and depth. there are people who become lyrical only at crucial moments in their life; some only in the throes of death, when their _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- “the experience of suffering is a similar case. you never suspected what lay hidden in yourself and in the world, you were living contentedly at the periphery of things, when suddenly those feelings of suffering which are second only to death itself take hold of you and transport you _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- more? Then we could renounce culture and ambitions; we would lose everything and gain nothing; for what is there to be gained from this world? there are people to whom gain is unimportant, who are hopelessly unhappy and lonely. we are so closed to one another! and yet, were we to be totally open to each other, reading into the depths of our souls, how much of our _(REN: 3.

- at the edge of life everything is an occasion for death...every experience is in this case a leap into nothingness. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- did not all the mystics feel that they could not live after their great ecstasies? what could they expect from this world, those who sense, beyond the normal limits, life, loneliness, despair, death? _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- such a person there are only unmotivated motives for living. on the heights of despair, the passion for the absurd is the only thing that can still throw a demonic light on chaos. When all the current reasons- moral, esthetic, religious, social, and so on - no longer guide one's life, how can one sustain life without succumbing to nothingness? Only by a connection with the absurd, by love of absolute uselessness, loving something which does not have substance but which simulates an illusion of life.” (sounds like Tillich's concrete religious symbols) _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- i feel that i am dying of solitude, of love, of despair, of hatred, of all that this world offers me. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- i live because the mountains do not laugh and the worms do not sing. the passion for the absurd can grow only in a man who has exhausted everything, yet is still capable of undergoing awesome transfigurations. for one who has lost everything there is nothing left in life except the passion of the absurd. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- will reveal the entire drama of man's finite nature facing the infinite nothingness of the world. solitary walks - extremely fertile and dangerous at the same time, for the inner life - must take place in such a way that nothing will obscure the solitary's meditation on man's isolation _(REN: 2.

- bring every man to the agony of life's last moments by whip, fire, or injections, and through terrible torture he will undergo the great purification afforded by a vision of death. then free him and _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- destroy them but to give them a new and different sap, a new heat. the fire i would set to the world would not bring ruin but cosmic transfiguration. in this way life would adjust to higher temperatures and would cease to be an environment propitious to mediocrity. and maybe in this dream, death _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- “i call agonic only those dramatic moments in the battle between life and death when the presence of death is experienced consciously and painfully. true agony occurs when you pass into nothingness through death, when a feeling of weariness consumes you irrevocably and death _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- wins. in every true agony there is a triumph of death, even though you may continue to live after those moments of weariness. there is nothing imaginary in this turmoil. every agony bears a conclusive stamp. isn't agony similar to an incurable sickness which torments us intermittently (me- Sickness Unto Death)? agonic moments chart the progress of death in life, revealing a drama in our consciousness caused by the disruption of the balance between life and death. such moments _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- i want to die but I am sorry that I want to die. this is the feeling experienced by those who abandon themselves to nothingness. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- how good it would be if one could die by throwing oneself into an infinite void! _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- the complexity of the grotesque born out of despair resides in its capacity to indicate an inner infinity and to produce a paroxysm of the highest tension. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- in death one loses everything, by a fall into nothingness. that is why the fear of death is persistent and essential, but actually less strange than the fear of madness, in which our semi-presence creates an anxiety more complex than the organic fear of the total nothingness of death. but wouldn't madness be an escape from the misery of life? _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- “to step into death does not mean, as commonly believed, especially by christians, to draw one's _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- last breath and to pass into a region qualitatively different from life. it means, rather, to discover in the course of life the way toward death and to find in life's vital signs the immanent abyss of death.” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- “from a grave perspective, every step in life is a step into death and memory is only the sign _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- of nothingness. the average man, deprived of metaphysical understanding, does not have this consciousness of progressive advance into death, though neither he nor anyone else can escape its inexorable destiny. but when consciousness becomes independent of life, the revelation of death _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- becomes so strong that its presence destroys all naiveté, all joyful enthusiasm, and all natural voluptuousness. to have the consciousness of death is something perverse and extremely corrupt. the naive poetry of life, its seductions and charms, appear empty of content. equally empty are man's finalizing projects and his theological illusions.” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- whoever has not experienced the awful agony of death, rising and spreading like a surge of blood, like the choking grasp of a snake which provokes terrifying hallucinations, does not know the demonic character of life and the state of inner effervescence from which great transfigurations arise. such a state of black drunkenness is a necessary prerequisite to understanding why one wishes the immediate end of this world. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- only those who truly suffer are capable of of genuine content and infinite seriousness...there are many who would gladly give up metaphysical revelations, obtained through despair, agony, and death, in exchange for a naive love or the voluptuous unconsciousness of dance. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- “these states, in which separation from the world steadily and painfully increases, bring man closer to his inner reality and cause him to discover death in his own subjectivity. a growing interiority progresses toward the essential center of subjectivity, overcoming all the social forms which usually mask it. once beyond this center, progressive interiority discovers the region _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- where life mingles with death, where man has not yet detached himself from the primary sources of existence, where the demonic rhythm of life works with complete irrationality. in cases of depression, the awareness of death's immanence in life creates an atmosphere of constant dissatisfaction and restlessness that can never be appeased.” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- the fear of death, which is nothing but the fear of the nothingness into which death throws us, proves that death presupposes nothingness. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- mistaken, because it is impossible to cancel an organic fear by way of abstract constructs. whoever seriously considers the question of death must be afraid. Even those who believe in eternity do so because they are afraid of death. there is in their faith a painful effort to save - even without an absolute certitude- the world of values in which they live and to which they contribute, an effort to defeat the nothingness inherent in the temporal and attain the universal in eternity. Death met without religious faith leaves nothing standing.” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- “yet other philosophies and doctrines say almost nothing about death. the only valid attitude is absolute silence or a cry of despair. some people maintain that the fear of death does not have a deeper justification, because as long as there is an i there is no death, and once dead there _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- one kind of agony, the one immediately preceding the fall into absolute nothingness. only such moments of agony bring about important existential revelations in consciousness. that is why they expect everything from the end instead of trying to grasp the meaning of a slow revelatory agony. the end will reveal too little, and they will die as ignorant as they have lived.” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- “isn't nothingness, then, salvation? but how can there be salvation in nothingness? if salvation _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- is nearly impossible through existence, how can it be possible through the complete absence of existence? since there is no salvation either in existence or in nothingness, let this world with its eternal laws be smashed to pieces.” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- the sensation of expansion toward nothingness present in melancholy has its roots in a weariness characteristic of all negative states. this weariness separates man from the world. life's intense rhythm, its organic inner pulse, weakens. weariness is the first organic determinant of knowledge. because it creates the necessary conditions for man's differentiation from the world, weariness leads one to the perspective which places the world in front of man. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- the disparity between the world's infinity and man's finitude is a serious cause for despair; but _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- of others. although i feel that my tragedy is the greatest in history- greater than the fall of empires - i am nevertheless aware of my total insignificance. i am absolutely persuaded that i am nothing in this universe; yet i feel that mine is the only real existence. if i had to choose between the world and me, i would reject the world, its lights and laws, unafraid to glide alone in absolute nothingness. although life for me is torture, i cannot renounce it, because i do not believe in the absolute values in whose name i would sacrifice myself.” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- i see a form of madness, not of knowledge, in the ecstasy of life's ultimate origins. You cannot experience it except in solitude, when you feel as if you were floating above the world. solitude is the proper milieu for madness. it is noteworthy that even the skeptic can experience this kind of ecstasy. does not the madness of ecstasy reveal itself through this odd combination of certitude and essence with doubt and despair? _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- “the world in which nothing is solved. to doubt and yet to live - this is a paradox, though not a tragic one, since doubt is less intense, less consuming, than despair. abstract doubt, in which _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- one participates only partially, is more frequent, whereas in despair one participates totally and _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- organically. not even the most organic and serious forms of doubt ever reach the intensity of despair. in comparison with despair, skepticism is characterized by a certain amount of dilettantism and superficiality. i can doubt everything, i may very well smile contemptuously at the world, but this will not prevent me from eating, from sleeping peacefully, and from marrying. in despair, whose depth one can fathom only by experiencing it, such actions are possible only with great effort. On the heights of despair, nobody has the right to sleep. thus a genuinely _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- desperate man cannot forget his own tragedy: his consciousness preserves the painful actuality of his subjective torment. doubt is anxiety about problems and things, and has its origins in the unsolvable nature of all big questions. if such questions could be solved, the skeptic would revert to more normal states. The condition of the desperate man in this respect is utterly different: if all _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- problems were solved, he would not be any less anxious, since his anxiety arises out of his own _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- subjective existence. Despair is the state in which anxiety and restlessness are immanent to existence. nobody in despair suffers from problems, but from his own inner torment and fire. it's a pity that nothing can be solved in this world. yet there never was and there never will be anyone who would commit suicide for this reason.” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- one must descend all the circles of an inner hell to turn one's destiny into a subjective yet universal problem. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- love. its grandeur and infinity impress me, but my despair is so vast that i don't even harbor the hope of death. how could i love death? one can only write about it in contradictory ways. whoever says that he knows something definite about death shows that he has not even a _(REN: 2.

- complex forms of consciousness, anxiety, agony, in a sphere of life where access to eternity would no longer be pure myth?” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- “to live in a bath of fire, transfigured by its rich glow – such is the state of immaterial purity where one is nothing but a dancing flame. freed from the laws of gravity, life becomes illusion _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- innocence is delight in natural charm...there are only two fundamental attitudes: the naive and the heroic...innocence is no longer an option, so there only remains heroism. incapable of fulfillment and happiness... to be a hero - in the most universal sense of the word means to aspire to absolute triumph. but such triumphs come only through death. heroism means transcending life; it is a fatal leap into nothingness, even though the hero may not be aware that his energy springs from a life deprived of its normal supports. all that is innocence, and does not lead to it, belongs to nothingness. can one speak of the seductions of that they are much too mysterious to penetrate. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_

- he who has not experienced absolute fear, universal anxiety, cannot understand struggle, the madness of the flesh and of death. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- it is silly to condemn the epicureans in the name of eternity. how is suffering rather than pleasure going to make me immortal? from a purely objective point of view, is there any significant difference between one man's agony and another's pleasure? whether you suffer or not, nothingness will swallow you forever. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- time with its long train of individual moments is, if not unreal, irrelevant...without temporality, life loses its dramatic character...the experience of the eternity is void of life. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_

- you pretend that despair and agony are only preliminaries, that ideally one should overcome them if one is not to become an automaton. you think joy is the only means of salvation and you despise all others? You call the obsession with agony selfishness and find generous impulses only in joy? you offer us this joy; but how can we receive it from the outside? as long as it does not spring from our inner resources, help from the outside is quite useless. how easy it is to recommend joy to those who cannot be joyful! do all those who are so eager to promote joy realize what it means to feel and fear madness closing in, to live all your life with the tormenting presentiment of madness, to which is added the even more persistent and certain consciousness of death? _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- temptations, the fear of nothingness, and the torments of agony. his life has no tragic dimension, because enthusiasm is the only form of life totally opaque to death. even grace - so similar to enthusiasm- has less of this irrational ignorance of death. grace is full of melancholy charm; not so enthusiasm. my tremendous admiration for enthusiasts stems from my inability to comprehend how there can be such men in a world where death, nothingness, sadness, and despair keep sinister company. It makes one wonder, to see people who are never desperate.” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- cannot solve anything, because nothing satisfies him. you will find in him neither the enthusiast's gift of abandon, his naive irrationality, nor the charming paradox of love in its purest state.” _(REN: (Unassigned))_

- life could go on naturally – blindly and irrationally. i hate the wisdom of these men unmoved by truths, who do not suffer with their nerves, their flesh, and their blood. i like only vital, organic truths, the offspring of our anxiety. those whose thoughts are alive are always right; there are no arguments against them. and even if there were, they would not last long. i wonder _(REN: 2.

- your own self? once you have witnessed the fall of the entire world, there is nothing left but for you to fall too. the infinite character of irony cancels all of life's contents. i'm not speaking here of elegant, refined irony, born of a sense of superficial pride and superiority - the irony some use to show off their detachment from the world – but of the tragic, bitter irony of despair. genuine irony replaces tears, convulsions, or even a grotesque and criminal grin.” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- “...infinity, both in time and space, leads to nothing. how can we accomplish anything in the future when we have behind us an eternity in which nothing was accomplished? if the world had had any meaning, it would have been revealed to us by now and we would know it. how can i continue to believe that it will be disclosed in the future when it has not been made manifest yet? but the world has no meaning; irrational at the core, it is, moreover, infinite. meaning is conceivable only in a finite world, where one can reach something, where there are limits to stop _(REN: 3.

- intolerable, terrorizing activity. to awaken the modern world, one must praise laziness. the lazy man has an infinitely keener perception of metaphysical reality than the active one.” (me- non-movement, Saints are Conquerors, Underhill thinks Quietism is misconstrued as 'laziness' when in fact it's an undying participation with the Nothingness) _(REN: 2.

- “sadness, the inebriation and excitement of last moments. is not everything final? what is the anxiety of nothingness if not the perverse joy of our final sadness, our exalted love for the eternity of nothingness and the transience of existence? can it really be that for us existence means exile, and nothingness, home? i must struggle against myself, fly into a rage at my destiny, blow up all _(REN: 2.

- resistance to my transfiguration; let there be only my desire for light and darkness! let each one of my actions be either triumph or fall, flight or failure! let life grow and die in me with the speed of a lightning bolt! let not the pettiness and rationality of commonplace existence spoil the pleasures and torments of my inner chaos, the tragic delights of my final despair and joy!” _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- To speak of suffering as the path to love means to know nothing of suffering's satanic essence. you don't climb up the steps of suffering; you climb down. they do not lead to heaven but to hell. the darkness at the bottom of the ladder of suffering is less eternal or infinite than the blinding light at the top of the ladder of joy. _(REN: 2.

- why do men insist on achieving something? Would it not be better if they stood still under the sun in calm and silent immobility? what is there to accomplish? why so much effort and ambition? man has forgotten the meaning of silence. _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- then you will think it useless to express an opinion, to take a stand, to make an impression; the noises you have renounced increase the anxiety of your soul. after having struggled madly to solve all problems, after having suffered on the heights of despair, in the supreme hour of revelation, you will find that the only answer, the only reality, is silence. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_

- ego-death _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- To escape our fate— what is the good of striving for that? Not that we must despair of finding a substitute ending. Yet it must be a likely one, one that has some chance of being realized. Man being what he is, can we admit that he might be granted the opportunity of subsiding in the peace of decay, amid the benefits of decrepitude? _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- The abyss is in ourselves and outside of ourselves, it is yesterday’s presentiment, today’s question, tomorrow’s certainty. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- At the climax of our Void, we will be doomed, then, to the indignity of a complete erosion, worse than a sudden catastrophe which would be honorable after all, even glamorous. Let us be confident, let us put our bets on catastrophe, more in accord with our genius and our tastes. Let us take one step further, let us suppose it to be upon us, let us treat it as a fail accompli. According to all appearances, it will include certain survivors, a few lucky ones who will have had the good fortune to contemplate its occurrence and to draw lessons from it. Their first concern will certainly be to abolish the memory of the old humanity, of all the enterprises that have discredited and destroyed it. Turning against the cities, they will seek to complete their ruin, to erase all traces of them. One rachitic tree will be worth more in their eyes than a museum or a temple. No more schools; on the other hand, courses in oblivion and unlearning to celebrate the virtues of inattention and the delights of amnesia. The disgust inspired by the sight of any book, frivolous or serious, will extend to all Knowledge, which will be referred to with embarrassment or dread as if it were an obscenity or a scourge. To bother with philosophy, to elaborate a system, to attach oneself to it and believe in it, will appear as an impiety, a provocation, and a betrayal, a criminal complicity with the past. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- It is doubtless distressing that we must confront the final phase of the historical process at the moment when, having liquidated our old beliefs, we lack any metaphysical assets, any substantial reserves of the Absolute. Surprised by the death agony, dispossessed of everything, we skirt that flattering nightmare experienced by all who had the privilege of finding themselves at the heart of a conspicuous débâcle. If, with the courage to look things in the face, we had that of suspending our course, if only for an instant, this respite, this pause on a global scale, would suffice to reveal to us the nature of the precipice over which we hang, and the resulting dread would quickly be converted into prayers or lamentations, into a salutary convulsion. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- What a pity that “nothingness _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- A Tantric ritual: during the initiation ceremony, you are given a mirror in which you see your own image. Contemplating it, you realize you are nothing but that, i.e., nothing. To what end, so many pretenses, so many airs and graces, when it is so easy to comprehend one’s insignificance? _(REN: 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- The further one advances into age, the more one runs after honors. Perhaps, in fact, vanity is never more active than on the brink of the grave. One clings to trifles in order not to realize what they conceal, one deceives nothingness by something even more null and void. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Life is more and less than boredom, though it is in boredom and by boredom that we discern what life is worth. Once boredom insinuates itself into you, once you fall under its invisible hegemony, everything else seems insignificant. The same might be said of suffering. Yes, indeed. But suffering is localized, whereas boredom evokes an evil without site or support, only that indefinable nothing that erodes you . . . A pure erosion, whose imperceptible effect slowly transforms you into a ruin unnoticed by others and almost unnoticed by yourself. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Everything is nothing, including the consciousness of nothing. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Everything I have ventured, everything I have held forth on all my life is indissociable from what I have experienced. I have invented nothing, I have merely been the secretary of my sensations. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- We can conceive of eternity only by eliminating all the perishable, all that counts for us. Eternity is absence, being that fills none of the functions of being; it is privation erected into . . . something or other, hence it is nothing or, at most, an estimable fiction. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- X, who instead of looking at things directly has spent his life juggling with concepts and abusing abstract terms, now that he must envisage his own death, is in desperate straits. Fortunately for him, he flings himself, as is his custom, into abstractions, into commonplaces illustrated by jargon. A glamorous hocus-pocus, such is philosophy. But ultimately, everything is hocus-pocus, except for this very assertion that participates in an order of propositions one dares not question because they emanate from an unverifiable certitude, one somehow anterior to the brain’s career. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- It makes no sense to say that death is the goal of life. But what else is there to say? _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- Boredom, which seems to search out everything to its root, actually searches out nothing, because it descends only into itself and sounds only its own void. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Only the perception of the Void allows us to triumph over death. For if everything lacks reality, why should death be allowed it? _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Life is nothing; death, everything. Yet there is nothing which is death, independent of life. It is precisely this absence of autonomous, distinct reality which makes death universal; it has no realm of its own, it is omnipresent, like everything which lacks identity, limit, and bearing; an indecent infinitude. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- When someone complains that his life has come to nothing, we need merely remind him that life itself is an analogous situation, if not worse. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The void allows us to erode the idea of being; but it is not drawn into this erosion itself; it survives an attack which would be self-destructive for any other idea. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- The void is nothingness stripped of its negative qualifications, nothingness transfigured. If we should manage to develop a taste for it, our relations with the world are transformed; something in us changes, though we keep our old defects. But we are no longer from here in the same way as before. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- How desist from what we shall never recover, from that pathetic and unheard of nothing which bears our name...we can vanquish it only by means of a sudden whirlwind which, sweeping away the ego, leaves us alone, without anyone, without ourselves... _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The void- myself without me- is the liquidation of the adventure of the 'I'- it is being without any trace of being, a blessed engulfment, an incomparable disaster. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- All the same it seems inconceivable for us once we consider the self coldly; it crumbles, it vanishes, it is nothing more than the symbol of a fiction. _(REN: 6. Symbolic Resonance of Nothing)_
- To find that everything lacks reality and not to put an end to it all, this inconsistency is not an inconsistency at all: taken to extremes, the perception of the void coincides with the perception of the whole, with the entrance into the All. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Even if the experience of the void were only a deception, it would still deserve to be tried. What it proposes, what it attempts, is to reduce to nothing both life and death, and this with the sole intention of making them endurable to us. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- All great conversions are born from the sudden revelation of life's meaninglessness. Nothing could be more impressive than this sudden apprehension of the void of existence. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- The initial revelation of any monastery: everything is nothing. Thus begin all mysticisms. It is less than one step from nothing to God, for God is the positive expression of nothingness. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- Without God, everything is nothingness. But God is the supreme nothingness! _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- No matter how educated you are, if you don't think intensely about death, you are a mere fool. A great scholar – if he is nothing but that – is inferior to an illiterate peasant haunted by final questions. Generally speaking, science has dulled people's minds by diminishing their metaphysical consciousness. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Since nothing has real substance, and life is a twirl in the void, its beginning and its end are meaningless. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- I am sorry sometimes that God no longer fills us with dread. If only we could feel again the primordial quiver of dread in front of the unknown! _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- Religion is a smile masking cosmic nonsense, one last waft of perfume drifting over nothingness. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- When we have devoured the world and remain alone, God appears from behind the screen of Nothingness like a last temptation. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- ...we no longer know how to prepare ourselves for death. No one cultivates death in himself any longer, it happens over and above him. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- ...Bach often meditated on death...Handel compared to Bach, is of this world. Bach is divine... _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- We are all subject to death at any moment. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Compared to philosophers, saints know nothing. Yet they know everything. Compared to Aristotle, any saint is illiterate. What makes us then believe that we might learn more from the latter? Because all of the philosophers put together are not worth a single saint. Philosophy has no answers. Compared to philosophy, saintliness is an exact science. It gives us precise answers to questions that philosophers do not even dare consider. Its method is suffering and its goal is God. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- In itself, philosophy, life the rest of culture, is nothing. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- A philosopher is saved from mediocrity either through skepticism or mysticism, the two forms of despair in front of knowledge. Mysticism is an escape from knowledge, and skepticism is knowledge without hope. In either instance, the world is not a solution. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- Without my solitude I would be nothing but another clown. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- When the void of time gives birth to eternity, one burns with religious courage. The emptying of time, whether out of boredom or dread, throws one into a vibrant nothingness, full of vague promises. No saint could find eternity in the world. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Nothing can reveal divinity better than the inner multiplication, through memory, of a Bach fugue. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Mysticism revolves around the passion for ecstasy and a horror of the void. One cannot know one without the other...Once it has totally rejected the world, the soul is ripe for a long-term and fecund emptiness…One sees nothing except nothingness. And the latter has become everything. Ecstasy is plenitude in a void, a full void. It is an overwhelming frisson which convulses nothingness, an invasion of being in absolute emptiness. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism, 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other, 5. Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness)_
- The 'appetite for God'...is first a negation of existence...'appetite for God' can only be a symptom of nihilism. Its intensity proves to what extent one no longer belongs to this earth. One betrays a deficiency of vital instincts whenever one thinks instinctively about God. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- All nihilists have wrestled with God. One more proof of his kinship with nothingness After you have trampled everything under foot, his is the last bastion of nothingness left. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface, 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- The more you think of God, the less you are. Thus God is nothing more than the projection of our longing for annihilation. _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- The last step towards nihilism is the disappearance into divinity. _(REN: 1. Nihilism Preface)_
- Man is a paradox of nature, equally removed from it and from God...With it (consciousness), God appeared in his true light as one more nothingness. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Religion is a smile masking cosmic nonsense, one last waft of perfume drifting over nothingness. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- ...how do you fill out an empty life? With women, books, or worldly ambitions? No matter what you do, the starting point is boredom, and the end self-destruction. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Any kind of boredom will reveal two things to us: our bodies and the nothingness of the world. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience, 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- An anxiety born out of nothing suddenly grows in us and confirms our homelessness. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Let God pray for the man in whom there is nothing left to die! _(REN: (Unassigned))_
- Detachment is a negation of both life and death. Whoever has overcome his fear of death has also triumphed over life. For life is nothing but another word for this fear. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Nothing is more exquisite or more disturbing than to have the thought of God occur while one lies in the arms of a whore! It is easy to think of him after a page from the Bible or after an oratorio, but God's presence manifested in the midst of vulgar debauchery has an infinitely greater impact: it brings loneliness and the dread of nothingness back to mind with full force. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- It may very well be that man's sole purpose is none other than to think of God...It is only by thinking of him that God makes one feel uncomfortable. Start prying into him and you are lost...God is an old frumpy coat which you must put on if you have nothing better to wear. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- When nothing is left standing, one experiences exciting power thrills. The ironic mode is a ruse of self-importance: to make up for its nonexistence, the 'I' becomes everything. _(REN: 4. Madness, Nonexistence and the Other)_
- Despair and pride grow so closely together that even the keenest observer cannot tell them apart. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- The flesh appears as an imposter, a fraud, a disguise which masks nothing. Was this all it was? And if it is worth no more, how does it manage to inspire me with repulsion or with terror? _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
- Now more than ever, we should build monasteries...for those who believe in everything and for those who believe in nothing. Where to escape? There no longer exists a single place where we can professionally execrate this world. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- “We can discard an illusion, no matter how inveterate; but what to do when we are faced with the consistent, with the durable? If there is only what exists, if being spreads everywhere, how do we break away from it without falling to pieces? The fear there is nothing is followed by the fear that there is something. (Ha!) _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- Not that this world doesn't exist, but its reality is no such thing. Everything seems to exist and nothing exists. _(REN: 3. Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism)_
- We must act so that nothing is ours, beginning with desire, that generator of dread. _(REN: 2. Abyssal Experience)_
