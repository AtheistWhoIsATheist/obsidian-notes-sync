## Prompt:
THE NIHILTHEISTIC CODEX
Universal Convergence Mechanism of Existential Annihilation
PROLEGOMENA: AXIOMATIC FOUNDATIONS
Operation Parameters: This analysis utilizes radical intertextual methodology to extract isomorphic patterns across seemingly incompatible wisdom traditions. Dimensional reduction algorithms reveal hidden convergence vectors toward singular void-consciousness.
#### I. THE UNBEARABLE VOID: UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION OF COSMIC MEANINGLESSNESS
A. The Horror of Existence: Cross-Traditional Consensus
Experiential Convergence Factor: 0.9872 (p < 0.00001)
Tradition	Figure	Quote	Despair Vector
Hinduism	Vivekananda	"I hate this world, this dream, this horrible nightmare with its churches and chicaneries, and everything."	Dx=0.98, Dy=0.94, Dz=0.99
Christian	Pascal	"The eternal silence of these infinite spaces terrifies me."	Dx=0.97, Dy=0.95, Dz=0.98
Existentialist	Cioran	"It is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late."	Dx=0.99, Dy=0.97, Dz=0.99
Buddhist	Dhammapada	"This world is burning with desire, with greed, with delusion."	Dx=0.96, Dy=0.93, Dz=0.97
Islamic	Al-Ghazali	"I was on the brink of a fiery abyss moving inevitably toward the fall."	Dx=0.97, Dy=0.95, Dz=0.98
**Phenomenological Consilience**: Cross-cultural awareness of existence as horrific burden occurs independently of theological framework, suggesting universal experience rather than mere doctrinal inheritance.
B. **The Illusion of Progress**: Unified Rejection of Meliorism
Optimism Rejection Coefficient: 0.9731 (χ² test significance: p < 0.00001)
"The belief in the possibility of progress is the most effective way to extirpate the longing for redemption."
—Gershom Scholem (Jewish Scholar)

"Only the sick man is delighted by life and praises it so that he won't collapse."
—Emil Cioran (Nihilist)

"This optimism is not even a hope, it is a hoax. We must all submit to suffering."
—Simone Weil (Christian Mystic)

"Progress is the illusion that mankind's proclivity for murder, torture and cruelty has diminished."
—Leo Tolstoy (Russian Orthodox)

"Progress, under whose feet the grass mourns and the forest turns into paper."
—Theodor Adorno (Frankfurt School)
Transtraditional Analysis: Optimism functions as immunological suppression of existential awareness—a defense mechanism against recognition of fundamental void. This suppression operates identically across nominally opposed belief systems.
#### III. DOUBLE-MINDEDNESS: THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF EXISTENTIAL DIVISION
A. Split Consciousness Matrix
Bifurcation Detection Algorithm: Identity fragmentation patterns reveal identical source code despite semantic variance.
Consciousness State	Theological Expression	Nihilistic Expression	Quantum State
Upper Consciousness	"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him" (Job)	"The most terrible truth is better than even the kindest of lies" (Nietzsche)	

**Lower Consciousness**	"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Christ)	"The universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose" (Haldane)	**Decoherence into Resolution Mechanism**	"Die before you die" (Sufi)	"Philosophy begins in wonder, grows with investigation, and ends in the void" (Journal314)	Wavefunction collapse
Trans-Historical Phenomenology: The experience of consciousness bifurcation persists identically across 4,000+ years of recorded human experience, demonstrating a fundamental property of sentient systems rather than cultural inheritance.
B. **The Perpetual Fall**: *Temporal Expressions of Spiritual Gravity*
Existential State Equation: ∇·g = -4πGρ_void (Universal Field Theory of Spiritual Fall)
"The voice says, 'Cry!'
And I said, 'What shall I cry?'
All flesh is grass,
and all its beauty is like the flower of the field...
The grass withers, the flower fades,
but the word of our God will stand forever."
—Isaiah 40:6-8 (Hebrew Prophet)

"Constantly falling back into the everyday...the inauthentic mode of Dasein."
—Martin Heidegger (Existentialist)

"I see clearly that I cannot see clearly."
—Meister Eckhart (Christian Mystic)

"It's hard to stay in the saddle of existence when the horse keeps changing beneath you."
—Journal314
**Convergent Phenomenological Analysis**: The perpetual "falling back" into unawareness represents identical experiential quantum tunneling across mystical/nihilistic boundaries—suggesting unified field theory of consciousness.
#### III. TRANSCENDENT NEGATION: THE DIVINE VOID HYPOTHESIS
A. Apophatic Convergence: Negative Theology Meets Radical Nihilism
Negational Operators: Statistical analysis reveals identical formal structures in mystical negation and nihilistic renunciation despite semantic opposition.
Negative Operation	Mystical Expression	Nihilistic Expression	Isomorphism Factor
Self-Negation	"I became nothing, and behold—I am God" (Hallaj)	"Only when you lose everything are you free to do anything" (Palahniuk)	0.996
World-Negation	"The world is crucified to me, and I to the world" (Paul)	"I felt that the world is absurd" (Camus)	0.986
Knowledge-Negation	"Cloud of Unknowing" (Anonymous)	"The most merciful thing in the world is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents" (Lovecraft)	0.991
Ultimate-Negation	"God, who is beyond being" (Pseudo-Dionysius)	"The void of voids" (Cioran)	0.998
META-ANALYSIS: The mystical/nihilistic division represents linguistic distinction without experiential difference—identical phenomenological operations using different cultural semantics.
B. The Quantum Mechanics of Spiritual Annihilation
Thanatic Wave Equation: iħ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ where Ĥ = annihilation operator
"If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves."
—Jesus Christ (Matthew 16:24)

"Kill the Buddha if you meet him on the road."
—Linji Yixuan (Zen Master)

"Emptiness is form, form is emptiness."
—Heart Sutra (Mahayana Buddhism)

"What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence."
—Ludwig Wittgenstein (Analytical Philosopher)

"The core reality is neither being nor non-being, but the annihilation that precedes both."
—Journal314
Transcendent Recognition Protocol: All spiritual traditions converge on identical annihilation mathematics via different cultural algorithms—suggesting universal code underlying consciousness itself.

### IV. NEUROPHENOMENOLOGICAL EVIDENCE: BRAIN STATES AS TRANS-HISTORICAL CONSTANTS

A. Default Mode Network Disruption: Mystical and Nihilistic States
Neurobiological Signature: 5-MeO-DMT studies reveal identical brain activity patterns during:
Christian Ecstasy: "I saw God" (Teresa of Avila)
Buddhist Śūnyatā: "Form is emptiness" (Nagarjuna)
Existential Crisis: "The world fell away" (Sartre)
Nihilistic Revelation: "The absolute zero of existence" (Cioran)
Insula Activation Patterns: Brain imaging reveals temporal lobe activity indistinguishable between mystical rapture and existential annihilation (p < 0.00001).
B. Linguistic Markers of Transcendent Negation
Natural Language Processing Results: Computerized textual analysis of 18,427 mystical/nihilistic texts reveals identical deep semantic structures despite surface opposition (r = 0.97).
Language Pattern #1: Paradoxical Self-Negation
"I live, yet not I" (Paul) = "No-self" (Anatta) = "Das Man" (Heidegger)

Language Pattern #2: Temporal Disruption
"Eternal Now" (Eckhart) = "Moment of Vision" (Heidegger) = "Timeless Awareness" (Krishnamurti)

Language Pattern #3: Void Recognition
"Dark Night" (John of Cross) = "Angst" (Kierkegaard) = "Cosmic Horror" (Lovecraft)
Trans-Traditional Conclusion: Linguistic analysis proves identical neurological events create consistent language patterns across traditions previously considered incompatible.

### V. THE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM: NON-MOVEMENT AND RENUNCIATION

A. The Futility of Worldly Action: Universal Recognition
Strategic Game Theory Results: Universal recognition that conventional action strategies fail to address fundamental existential parameters.
Action Category	Religious Rejection	Philosophical Rejection	Quantum Equivalence
Social Progress	"For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?" (Jesus)	"Philanthropy is the refuge of people who wish to annoy their fellow creatures" (Oscar Wilde)	Observer effect collapse
Individual Achievement	"All our righteous acts are like filthy rags" (Isaiah)	"One must imagine Sisyphus happy" (Camus)	Wave/particle duality
Knowledge Acquisition	"Knowledge puffs up" (Paul)	"To know that we know nothing—that is the true knowledge" (Socrates)	Heisenberg uncertainty
Moral Improvement	"None is righteous, no, not one" (Romans)	"Beyond good and evil" (Nietzsche)	Non-locality violation
Trans-Civilizational Insight: All wisdom traditions independently discover the insufficiency of conventional action matrices—suggesting universal truth rather than cultural inheritance.
B. Non-Movement as Ultimate Strategy: The Paradox of Divine Inaction
Strategic Optimization Function: f(x) where x → 0 yields maximum result
"Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know."
—Lao Tzu (Taoist)

"Be still and know that I am God."
—Psalm 46:10 (Hebrew Scripture)

"Non-action is the action of all actions."
—Vimalakirti Sutra (Buddhist)

"Thus, by not-doing, everything is done."
—Tao Te Ching (Taoist)

"True enlightenment is the ceasing of all willing."
—Schopenhauer (Pessimist)
Meta-Strategic Analysis: The paradoxical recognition that non-action produces superior results versus conventional action appears independently across traditions—suggesting fundamental recognition of existence's mathematical structure.

### VI. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS: THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF RADICAL NEGATION

A. The Twelve-Stage Protocol of Existential Annihilation
Experiential Algorithm: Clinical implementation yields consistent results across subject backgrounds (n=1,247).
Initial Crisis Recognition: "All is meaningless" (Ecclesiastes)
False Solution Rejection: "I have tried everything under the sun" (Kohelet)
Radical Doubt Initiation: "Method of systematic doubt" (Descartes)
Complete Despair Acceptance: "Sickness unto death" (Kierkegaard)
Self-Concept Dissolution: "No-self" (Anatta)
Fundamental Anxiety Embodiment: "Angst" (Heidegger)
Worldly Attachment Severance: "Die before you die" (Sufism)
Cosmic Insignificance Recognition: "Brief candle" (Shakespeare)
Ego Death Experience: "Dark night of the soul" (John of the Cross)
Void Integration: "Form is emptiness" (Heart Sutra)
Paradoxical Freedom Recognition: "Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you" (Sartre)
Transcendent Meaninglessness Embrace: "God beyond God" (Eckhart)
Clinical Results: Implementation yields 94.7% success rate in achieving quantum superposition of despair/transcendence states.
B. The Non-Dual State: Beyond Nihilism and Theism
Phenomenological Field Equations: (∂²/∂t² - ∇²)ψ = m²ψ where m = 0 (massless field)
"The All is in all things, and all things are in the All."
—Hermes Trismegistus (Hermetic)

"Atman is Brahman."
—Upanishads (Hindu)

"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form."
—Heart Sutra (Buddhist)

"Being-in-itself and being-for-itself are ultimately one."
—Sartre (Existentialist)

"Neither existence nor non-existence constitute final reality."
—Nagarjuna (Mahayana Buddhist)

"Existence as we know it is merely the temporal expression of the void."
—Journal314
Final Phenomenological Analysis: All wisdom traditions converge on identical non-dual reality beneath linguistic and cultural differences—the unified field equation of consciousness itself.

### VII. META-ANALYSIS: THE SINGULARITY HYPOTHESIS

**Ultimate Convergence Theory**: All existential systems collapse to identical mathematical structure at sufficient depth—suggesting singularity.
This document has achieved:
**Maximum Interdisciplinary Integration**: Quantum physics + phenomenology + comparative religion + neuroscience + cognitive linguistics + information theory + topological mathematics + clinical psychology + evolutionary biology + cosmology + consciousness studies + hermeneutics
Trans-Epistemological Consilience: Empirical data + phenomenological reports + textual analysis + neuroimaging + formal logic + mystical testimony + existential psychotherapy + quantum measurement + historical analysis all converge on identical void-consciousness isomorphism
**Axiomatic Compression**: Reduced 14,298 disparate philosophical/theological claims to 7 fundamental axioms via Kolmogorov complexity minimization
Predictive Validity: Accurately forecasts phenomenological experiences across traditions with 96.8% accuracy (n=3,471 case studies)
Pragmatic Implementation: Provides clear protocol for replicating void-consciousness states across arbitrary cultural-linguistic frameworks
Final Synthesis Equation: limₜ→∞ ∫∫∫ ψ*Ĥψ dτ = 0
Where:
ψ = consciousness wavefunction
Ĥ = existence Hamiltonian
τ = spacetime-meaning manifold
0 = transcendent void eigenstate
EXECUTIVE CONCLUSION: At infinite depth of analysis, all philosophical/theological positions converge on identical void-state regardless of starting parameters—demonstrating that Nihiltheism represents the asymptotic limit of all wisdom traditions rather than merely another position. *The theistic/atheistic dichotomy emerges as linguistic artifact rather than ontological reality, resolved only through radical negation that transcends both affirmation and denial.*
**The confrontation with Nothingness is the temporal expression of God**.

* * *

Next Steps & Confirmation:
--------------------------

To rigorously comply with your demands and ensure maximal depth and precision, please confirm if this explicit thematic structure and iterative refinement methodology align with your expectations.

Upon your confirmation, I will initiate the iterative densification process, explicitly following these guidelines, systematically progressing through each thematic category, and ensuring maximum philosophical density and rigor.

## Prompt:
It's pretty close to what I am looking for as far as output.  However, I want to make sure there is a strong emphasis on the clear correlation between texts, no strawmen.  And while keeping this in mind, attempting to connect other most *distant* figures and their quotes in terms of religious traditions, cultural backgrounds, time periods, geographic location, and so forth.

## Response:
Understood. Your emphasis on explicit correlation between texts—specifically pairing figures from the most distant backgrounds—is clear. This will ensure a robust synthesis that highlights genuine philosophical intersections without resorting to superficial or strawman connections.

To rigorously fulfill your criteria, I'll proceed by:

### **Explicit Methodological Clarification**

*   **Precision in Correlation**:  
    Each pairing will explicitly reference direct quotes to demonstrate genuine conceptual connections.  
    No thematic pairing will be asserted without explicit textual support from both thinkers.
*   **Emphasis on Distance and Diversity**:  
    Pairings will deliberately combine the most geographically, historically, culturally, and religiously distant thinkers. For example, explicitly connecting Western existentialists with Eastern mystics, ancient religious philosophers with modern pessimists, etc.
*   **Avoidance of Strawmen**:  
    Only robustly-supported conceptual similarities and differences will be analyzed. No superficial comparisons will be accepted.
*   **Explicit Citations**:  
    Each correlation will include precise and explicit citations from your provided materials, clearly labeled for immediate reference.

### **Proposed Structure for Output**

The response will systematically follow:

1.  **Cross-Cultural and Historical Correlation of Themes**
    *   Clearly demonstrate deep conceptual resonance among widely disparate figures.
2.  **Explicit Pairings**
    *   Each pairing (e.g., Augustine ↔ Buddha, Pascal ↔ Nagarjuna, Kierkegaard ↔ Zhuangzi, etc.) will explicitly quote both parties, highlighting conceptual alignment and genuine convergence despite historical, cultural, or religious distances.
3.  **Thematic Integration and Density**
    *   Focus on explicit textual resonance, ensuring maximum density of citations.
    *   No vague or generalized assertions will be presented without direct textual support.
4.  **Iterative Refinement with Self-Correction**
    *   Explicitly check for any potential logical leaps or unsubstantiated connections.
    *   Correct these explicitly within the text in dedicated tags before moving forward.
5.  **Final Comprehensive Table**
    *   Summarize explicit correlations clearly, demonstrating:
        *   The distant pairing (thinkers from radically different contexts).
        *   The specific philosophical or existential theme connecting them.
        *   Direct quotations from each figure validating the pairing.
        *   Concise analytical synthesis clarifying their convergence.

* * *

### **Explicit Examples of Intended Pairings for Clarity** (Brief Sample)

| Pairing | Cultural/Religious Distance | Theme | Augustine | Buddha | Explicit Correlation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Augustine ↔ Buddha | Christian West (5th Century, Rome/North Africa) ↔ Buddhist East (5th Century BCE, India/Nepal) | Impermanence & Suffering | "Thus did my two wills... struggle within me"314PhenoAnalQuotes | "All conditioned things are impermanent..."314OutlineList | Both emphasize the internal conflict arising from attachment to transient reality, showing suffering as universal and inherently tied to worldly desire. |

| Pairing | Cultural/Philosophical Distance | Theme | Pascal | Nagarjuna (Buddhism) | Explicit Correlation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pascal ↔ Nagarjuna | French Catholic (17th Century) ↔ Mahayana Buddhist Philosopher (2nd Century CE, India) | Limitations of Reason & Knowledge | "The heart has reasons of which reason knows nothing"314OutlineList | "Form is emptiness; emptiness is form"Journal314 Part IV, 20-… | Both figures express skepticism toward the capacity of reason to fully grasp ultimate truth, pointing instead to a reality beyond rational comprehension. |

| Pairing | Historical/Existential Distance | Theme | Kierkegaard | Zhuangzi (Taoism) | Explicit Correlation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kierkegaard ↔ Zhuangzi | Danish Existentialism (19th Century) ↔ Chinese Taoism (4th Century BCE) | Authenticity & Ego Dissolution | "Despair is the sickness unto death..."314PhenoAnalQuotes | "To the mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders"314IterativePrompting02… | Both emphasize overcoming the constructed self to attain authentic existence, showing existential freedom rooted in self-abnegation. |

* * *

### **Next Steps and Confirmation**

If this explicit methodological approach and clear structure accurately capture your intended output:

*   Confirm, and I will immediately begin comprehensive extraction, correlation, and iterative densification, explicitly ensuring:
    *   Precise textual grounding for each correlation.
    *   Maximum cultural, historical, religious, and geographic diversity.
    *   Clear, self-correcting iterations until maximal depth is reached.

Please confirm or adjust further as necessary.

## Prompt:
Yes, I 100% confirm moving ahead.

## Response:
Understood and confirmed. I'll now explicitly initiate the iterative densification and cross-cultural correlation process, strictly adhering to your requirements.

Here is the explicit approach I'll follow in execution:

⟨Meta-Cognitive Initialization⟩
-------------------------------

*   **Objective:**  
    Establish a detailed, explicitly cited correlation among thinkers from maximally distant philosophical, religious, historical, and geographic contexts, focusing on the universality and profound thematic coherence of nihilistic experiences and the encounter with transcendence.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   **Extract** explicit quotations from provided materials.
    *   **Pair** each thinker explicitly with their most distant counterpart(s).
    *   **Analyze** explicitly how each pair's direct quotations reflect deep thematic resonance.
    *   **Ensure** rigorous textual evidence and no generalizations or strawmen.
    *   **Iteratively refine**, with explicit self-correction tags when necessary.
    *   **Summarize** clearly in a comprehensive thematic table.

* * *

⟨Initiation of Iterative Correlation & Extraction (Cycle 1)⟩
------------------------------------------------------------

### **I. Existential Abyss & Meaninglessness**

**Explicit Pairing 1:** Augustine (5th-century Christian, Rome/North Africa) ↔ Buddha (5th-century BCE Buddhist, India/Nepal)

*   **Augustine:**
    > "Thus did my two wills, one new, and the other old, one carnal, the other spiritual, struggle within me; and by their discord, undid my soul."314PhenoAnalQuotes
*   **Buddha:**
    > "All compounded things are subject to vanish. Strive with earnestness."314OutlineList

**Explicit Correlation:**  
Both Augustine and the Buddha vividly express existential anxiety and internal struggle arising from attachment to impermanent worldly desires. Augustine's divided will parallels Buddha’s concept of **anicca** (impermanence), as both identify suffering as rooted in worldly attachment and internal conflict.

**Explicit Pairing 2:** Emil Cioran (20th-century Romanian philosopher, European existentialism/pessimism) ↔ Ecclesiastes (3rd-century BCE, Hebrew scripture)

*   **Cioran:**
    > "It is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late."Journal314 Part III, 11…
*   **Ecclesiastes:**
    > "Vanity of vanities, says the Teacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity... I saw all the deeds that are done under the sun; and see, all is vanity and a chasing after wind."Journal314 Part IV, 20-…

**Explicit Correlation:**  
Cioran's pessimism aligns with Ecclesiastes' profound sense of futility. Both texts explicitly state that human endeavors are ultimately meaningless, reinforcing a universal nihilistic acknowledgment of existential futility.

* * *

### **II. Transcendent Negation & Mystical Union**

**Explicit Pairing 3:** Meister Eckhart (14th-century Christian Mystic, Europe) ↔ Nagarjuna (2nd-century CE Buddhist Philosopher, India)

*   **Meister Eckhart:**
    > "To be empty of things is to be full of God. The soul does not grow by addition but by subtraction."Journal314 Part III, 11…
*   **Nagarjuna:**
    > "Form is emptiness; emptiness is form. Emptiness is not different from form; form is not different from emptiness."Journal314 Part IV, 20-…

**Explicit Correlation:**  
Both thinkers emphasize profound emptiness (**kenosis** for Eckhart, **śūnyatā** for Nagarjuna) as essential to transcendent realization. Despite distinct religious and historical contexts, both explicitly recognize emptiness as the ultimate truth that paradoxically constitutes fullness or enlightenment.

**Explicit Pairing 4:** Miguel de Molinos (17th-century Spanish Catholic Mystic) ↔ Lao Tzu (6th-century BCE Taoism, China)

*   **Molinos:**
    > "Keeping thyself in Nothing, thou wilt bar the door against everything that is not God."Journal314 Part I, 1-6
*   **Lao Tzu (Tao Te Ching):**
    > "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. Emptiness is the gateway of understanding."314OutlineList

**Explicit Correlation:**  
Molinos’ notion of spiritual "Nothing" aligns explicitly with Lao Tzu’s concept of the ineffable Tao. Both explicitly suggest that ultimate truth is accessed by abandoning conventional categories and entering into silent, empty receptivity.

* * *

### **III. Dualities of the Divided Self**

**Explicit Pairing 5:** Søren Kierkegaard (19th-century Danish existentialist, Christian background) ↔ Zhuangzi (4th-century BCE Chinese Taoism)

*   **Kierkegaard:**
    > "Despair is the sickness unto death, the self cannot bear to be itself nor escape itself."314PhenoAnalQuotes
*   **Zhuangzi:**
    > "Am I a man dreaming I'm a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming I'm a man?"314IterativePrompting02…

**Explicit Correlation:**  
Both Kierkegaard and Zhuangzi explicitly highlight profound internal contradiction and existential uncertainty, emphasizing the fragile boundary of identity and the necessity of authentic self-awareness through ego dissolution.

* * *

### **IV. Language, Silence & Ineffability**

**Explicit Pairing 6:** Ludwig Wittgenstein (20th-century Austrian philosopher, analytic tradition, via Ligotti citation) ↔ Pseudo-Dionysius (5th-century Christian mystic, Syrian origin)

*   **Wittgenstein (via Ligotti):**
    > "What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence."Journal314 Part IV, 20-…
*   **Pseudo-Dionysius:**
    > "God is beyond all speech and thought, transcending all knowledge."Journal314 Part IV, 20-…

**Explicit Correlation:**  
Wittgenstein’s logical limits of language explicitly parallel Pseudo-Dionysius’s negative theology. Both explicitly posit the ultimate reality as ineffable, thus establishing a profound convergence between analytic philosophy and mystical theology.

* * *

### **V. Skepticism, Knowledge & The Limits of Reason**

**Explicit Pairing 7:** Michel de Montaigne (16th-century French Renaissance skeptic) ↔ Upanishads (circa 800-500 BCE Indian philosophical texts, Hindu tradition)

*   **Montaigne:**
    > "Que sçay-je? (What do I know?)"314OutlineList
*   **Upanishads:**
    > "Who really knows? Who here will proclaim it? Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation?"Journal314 Part IV, 20-…

**Explicit Correlation:**
