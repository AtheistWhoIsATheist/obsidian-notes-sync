## Luther on Faith, Works, and Free Will
- The section from the document 'Journal314_11-19' discusses the ideas of [[Martin Luther]], a key figure in [[Christianity | Christian]] theology, who emphasizes the importance of faith in [[God]] and the devaluation of earthly works.
- According to Luther, the more Christian a man is, the more evils and sufferings he must endure, and the moment one begins to have faith, they learn that all things in them are blameworthy, sinful, and damnable, which is why rituals and ceremonies should not be prioritized over faith.
- Luther's work 'Bondage of the Will' diminishes the concept of free will, as anything related to free will is considered earthly, and God is the ground of all value, leading to a rejection of self for unity between the self and God.
- Luther stresses the importance of knowing whether the will plays a role in salvation, and understanding the relationship between free will and God's grace, as this is the core of Christian matters, and not knowing this would make one uncertain and ignorant of God's role.
- Luther also emphasizes that God foreknows nothing by contingency, but rather foresees, purposes, and does all things according to His immutable, eternal, and infallible will, which throws the concept of free will into question, and those who assert free will must either deny or ignore this concept.
- The section also touches on the idea that one can call upon God and believe in His presence anywhere, not just in a church, as Luther mentions that even in prison or a difficult situation, one can still have faith and believe in God's presence.
- The author of the text is responding to criticism and offense taken by others regarding their stance on God's presence and the defense of their cause, which they have sustained with fortitude and firmness despite facing many dangers and hatred.

## Defense of the Author's Stance on God's Presence
- The author emphasizes that they have not defended their cause for personal gain, such as money or vain-glory, but rather for the sake of [[Bible | God's word]], which they believe must be maintained with an incorrupt and invincible mind, even in the face of temporal tumult.
- The author criticizes the instructions of others, which would have them compromise on the word of [[God]] for the sake of the Popes, the heads, and the peace of the community, and instead argues that one should rather despise the whole world, as instructed by [[Jesus | Christ]], and trust in God's grace and promise to the humbled.
- The author highlights the importance of recognizing one's own powerlessness and dependence on God's will, counsel, and work for salvation, and notes that God's methods of saving and justifying individuals often involve paradoxical actions, such as killing and making alive, or bringing down to hell and exalting to Heaven.
- The author references the Scripture, specifically I Samuel 2:6, which states that "The Lord killeth and maketh alive, He bringeth down to the grave and raiseth up," and notes that this is a theme that is well-explored in their writings, which their readers will be familiar with.
- The author also references Epicurus, implying that their critics may be influenced by his philosophical ideas, which consider the Word of God and a future life to be mere fables, and argues that this perspective is in stark contrast to the instruction of Christ and the truth of the Gospel.

## God's Nature, Free Will, and Human Blindness
- The concept of God's eternal mercy and loving-kindness is often concealed behind His eternal wrath and righteousness, which can be perceived as iniquity, making it challenging for individuals to comprehend His true nature and requiring a high degree of faith to believe in His mercy and justice.
- The idea of "Free-will" is discussed, with the acknowledgment that without the grace of [[God]], human free will is utterly ineffective and can do nothing good, highlighting the limitations of human power and the necessity of divine intervention.
- The distinction is made between human free will in earthly matters, such as the use of goods and possessions, and the lack of free will in spiritual matters, such as salvation or damnation, where humans are subject to the will of God or [[Satan]].
- The human heart is described as being bound by the power of Satan, requiring the quickening of the Spirit of God to enable individuals to see or hear spiritual truths, emphasizing the misery and blindness of the human race.
- The example of the Jews not being won over by Christ's works and words is cited, illustrating the idea that humans, left to themselves, are unable to comprehend spiritual truths, and that even the most evident and undeniable signs can be ignored or misunderstood.
- The notion that humans are blind to divine things without the Spirit is reinforced, making it no wonder that many talented individuals have remained blind to spiritual truths throughout history, and that the whole human race, without the Spirit, is essentially the kingdom of the devil and a realm of darkness.
- The concept of free will is further critiqued, with the argument that even inanimate objects, like stones or logs, can be said to have a form of free will, but only in a limited and conditional sense, highlighting the complexities and nuances of the idea of free will.
- The nature of ungodly individuals is described, describing them as being wholly turned to self and their own interests, much like Satan, emphasizing the idea that humans are either servants of [[God]] or servants of Satan.

## Worldly Desires vs. Spiritual Growth
- The section from the document 'Journal314_11-19' discusses the importance of prioritizing one's relationship with God over worldly desires, as stated by [[Thomas Merton]], emphasizing that seeking riches, glory, and power can lead to condemnation, and instead, one should focus on spiritual growth and union with God.
- The text highlights the idea that the things of the world, such as wealth, power, and wisdom, are temporary and can be a hindrance to one's spiritual journey, and that it is better to lose the world than to lose God, who is the creator of the world and can create innumerable worlds again.
- The author criticizes those who apply elegant similitudes and sentiments in a childish or perverted manner when discussing sacred topics, stating that the things God works are divine and exceed human capacity, and that the Word of God and the traditions of men are opposed to each other with implacable discord.
- Thomas Merton's perspective on the sacred attitude toward life is also discussed, emphasizing that it involves penetrating into the darkness and nothingness that one may feel, and realizing that God's mercy has transformed this nothingness into a temple, and that His light is hidden in the darkness.
- The section also touches on the concept of spiritual direction and meditation, stating that a contemplative is one who takes [[God]] seriously, seeks to live in generous simplicity, and is famished for truth, and that meditation is a means to enter into intimate contact with truth and God, and to experience the deepest realities of life by living them.
- The author notes that meditation is not just a matter of thinking things out, but rather a way to satisfy the soul's need for spiritual growth, and that it is especially important in a materialistic society that has robbed man's nature of its spiritual energy and tone, and that discipline is necessary, but it does not imply the obligation to follow one identical and rigid system.
- The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of maintaining a clear vision of God and the way to God, even when one's mental vision may become unclear, and that the principle of seeking union with God should always be the guiding principle.

## Mental Prayer and Union with God
- The members of the Mystical [[Body of Christ]] have the divine life of [[Jesus | Christ]] within them and are mystically identified with Him, and the goal of mental prayer is to consciously realize this union, as noted by [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]].
- According to the text, not everyone has the particular attraction to mental prayer, but it is essential for all to realize that the function of mental prayer is to bring them into conscious communion with [[God]], who is the source of their natural and supernatural life.
- In order to meditate, one must withdraw their mind from distractions and recollect their senses, which requires preserving moderate recollection throughout the day by living in an atmosphere of faith and with occasional moments of prayer and attention to God.
- The world today presents a challenge to those who want to acquire habits of recollection, with its numerous appeals to emotion and sense appetite, and the price of true recollection is a firm resolve to take no wilful interest in anything that is not useful or necessary to one's interior life.
- The author emphasizes the need to develop a strong resistance to the futile appeals of modern society and to mortify one's desires, not through extraordinary ascetic practices, but through self-denial required to live by the standards of reason and the Gospels.
- The author also notes that God is infinitely above us, although He is within us and is the principle of our being, and that we must enter into meditation with a realization of our spiritual poverty and our complete lack of the things we seek.
- The Fathers of the Church saw humanity as being like the Prodigal, starving in a distant land, far from God and Paradise, due to an inordinate preoccupation with perishing things and a constant inclination to self-gratification and sin.
- The saints are more keenly aware of the gulf between themselves and [[God]] than those who live in sin, and habitual self-complacency is often a sign of spiritual stagnation, leading to meditations that are comfortable but inconclusive and lacking in real indigence or urgent need for God.

## Prayer, Meditation, and the Contemplative Life
- The text from 'Journal314_11-19' discusses the importance of prayer and meditation in one's life, highlighting that trials and temptations can be a blessing as they force individuals to pray and seek God.
- It is emphasized that there is no one specific way or place to meditate, and that silence, tranquillity, recollection, and peace are the most important factors, as noted by the author, who also mentions the idea of meditating while walking in a garden.
- The text criticizes those who condemn all desire for leisure as a sin, stating that business is not the supreme virtue and that sanctity is not measured by the amount of work accomplished, but rather by the purity of one's love for God, as St. Therese of Lisieux reminds us that "God has no need of our works: He has need of our love".
- The ideal of the contemplative life is not the exclusion of all work, but rather finding a balance between work and leisure, and working with a spirit of detachment and recollection, so that even work can be a form of prayer.
- The concept of compunction is introduced, which is an awareness of one's indigence and need for [[God]], implying faith, sorrow, humility, and hope in God's mercy, and is essential for a living and personal relationship with God in prayer.
- The text also discusses the difference between meditation and contemplation, with meditation making use of definite theological and philosophical ideas of God, and contemplation being a concentration of the interior life on union with God, often involving a "dark" and confused knowledge of Him.
- Ultimately, the function of meditation is to enable individuals to realize and actualize the fundamental truths of their faith in their own experience, and can involve reflecting on one's own life, experiences, duties, and difficulties, rather than just ignoring them during prayer.
- The importance of meditation on one's vocation and response to God's will is emphasized, as it allows individuals to understand their charity towards others, fidelity to grace, and the presence of [[Jesus | Christ]] in their lives, which is essential for making spiritual decisions.
- To make meaningful decisions, it is necessary to create a religious perspective that acknowledges the inevitability of death and judgment, as this realization helps individuals to prioritize their actions and make choices that have lasting value, rather than being short-sighted opportunists.

## Meister Eckhart on Detachment and Sanctification
- The use of parables and imaginative figures, as seen in [[Bible | the Bible]] and the teachings of ancient philosophers, is an effective way to convey deep truths and make them accessible to people of all backgrounds, as noted by [[Meister Eckhart]] and referenced by Tillich.
- Meister Eckhart's teachings emphasize the importance of recognizing the nothingness of all creatures and the need to empty oneself of worldly attachments in order to be filled with [[God]], as he states that "to be full of things is to be empty of God" and that one must be "dead to himself and all created things" to abide in God's love.
- According to Meister Eckhart, deadly sin is a breach of nature that leads to a range of negative consequences, including a disquiet of the heart, a weakening of power, and a blindness of the sense, and can only be overcome by renouncing oneself and the world, and seeking sanctification through the power of grace.
- Sanctification is described as a state of being that allows individuals to remain immovable and unaffected by the impact of love, hate, joy, sorrow, and other earthly experiences, and is characterized by a deep sense of inner peace and detachment from worldly desires, which is made possible by the action of grace that draws men away from the transitory and purifies them from the earthly.
- The ultimate goal of sanctification is to attain a likeness to God, who remains in immovable sanctity, unaffected by the creation of the world and all its creatures, and to achieve this state, one must be empty of all creaturely love and full of God, as Meister Eckhart teaches that "to be empty of all creature's love is to be full of God, and to be full of creature-love is to be empty of God".
- The sanctity of God is not affected by the good works and prayers of men, and He is not more favourably inclined towards them as a result of these actions, as stated in the text from 'Journal314_11-19'.

## The Inner and Outer Man, Sanctification, and Divine Will
- Every person has an outer and inner man, and those who love God use their outer senses only as necessary, while concentrating their inner forces on the inner man, as they strive to love [[God | the Lord]] with all their heart, according to the teachings of spiritual men.
- The object of God's immovable sanctity is nothing, and He works in all hearts differently, depending on their preparation and susceptibility, much like the heat of an oven affects different types of bread in varying ways.
- For a heart to be ready for God's highest will, it must be vacant of all other things, and if God is to write on one's heart, everything else must be removed, just as a white tablet must be wiped clean before writing on it, as illustrated in the text.
- A truly sanctified heart prays for nothing, as it desires nothing and contains nothing it wishes to be freed from, except for the desire to be like God, as noted by St Dionysius, who comments on the text "Know ye not that all run, but one receiveth the prize?".
- The strong attraction of the soul to the Divine reduces everything to nothingness, and when this process reaches its culminating point, knowledge becomes ignorance, desire becomes indifference, and light becomes darkness, as stated by St [[Augustine of Hippo | Augustine]].
- No bodily or fleshly delight can occur without spiritual loss, as the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and the quickest means to bring us to perfection is suffering, which is a key aspect of the spiritual journey, as noted in the text.
- Ultimately, those who share in Christ's bitterest pangs and suffer with Him will enjoy everlasting blessedness, and nothing is sharper than suffering, yet nothing is sweeter than to have suffered, as emphasized in the text from 'Journal314_11-19'.

## Humility, Suffering, and the Spiritual Journey
- The foundation for achieving perfection is humility, as stated, and it is through humility that the Spirit can lift individuals to great heights, with love and suffering being closely intertwined, and this concept is echoed in the idea that the aim of man is not outward holiness by works, but life in [[God]], which expresses itself in works of love.
- The moral task of man is a process of spiritualization, where individuals must grow liker and nearer to God through diligence in spiritual business, and this aim is beyond the temporal, residing in the serene region of the everlasting Present, as emphasized by the notion that the merely temporal life is a negation of real being because it depends on itself and not on the deepest foundation of life.
- The love of the Cross is essential, as it must swallow up personal grief, and sorrow is considered the root of all virtue, with the right fear being the fear of losing God, and God brings forth His Son in individuals, whether they are aware of it or not, as noted by [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]].
- The end of all creation is concealed in the darkness of the everlasting Godhead, and God Himself remains unknown, with the light of the everlasting Father shining in darkness, and the darkness comprehending it not, and three things hinder individuals from hearing the everlasting Word: fleshliness, distraction, and the illusion of time.
- To hear the everlasting Word, individuals must renounce themselves, and God is equally near in all creatures, with the best way to serve God being with both fear and love, and to know God, individuals must know Him everywhere and outside time and place, since God is neither in this or that, but One and above them.

## Hearing the Everlasting Word and Plato's Allegory of the Cave
- The soul must look at nothing in time to recognize [[God]], and God is always ready, but individuals are often unready, and this idea is reflected in [[Allegory of the cave | the Allegory of the Cave]] by [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]], which explores the concept of individuals being disabused of their error and achieving a deeper understanding of reality.
- The text describes a scenario where a prisoner is liberated from a state of darkness and suddenly forced to confront the light, which causes him sharp pains and distress, and he is unable to see the realities that he had previously seen as shadows.
- The prisoner is then instructed to name the objects that are being shown to him, but he becomes perplexed and fancies that the shadows he formerly saw are truer than the objects that are now being revealed to him.
- If the prisoner were to compete with the other prisoners who had never moved out of the den in measuring the shadows, he would be at a disadvantage due to his weak sight, and men would ridicule him, saying that it was better not to attempt to ascend to the light.
- The allegory is then interpreted by the speaker, who says that the prison-house represents the world of sight, the light of the fire represents the sun, and the journey upwards represents the ascent of the soul into the intellectual world, according to the speaker's belief, which he expresses to [[Glaucon]].
- The speaker acknowledges that his interpretation may be correct or incorrect, and only God knows, but he has expressed his belief at Glaucon's desire, and now appends this allegory to the previous argument.
- The idea of good is considered to be the last concept to appear in the world of knowledge, and it can only be seen with effort, but once seen, it is inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right, and the source of reason and truth in the intellectual, as discussed in the context of "Simple Salvation, participation is needed".
- Those who attain a deep understanding of this concept, often referred to as a "beatific vision", are unwilling to descend to human affairs because their souls are drawn to the upper world, which is a natural desire if the allegory is to be trusted.
- The power of the idea of good is the foundation for rational action in both public and private life, and it is the responsibility of individuals to fix their eyes on this power in order to act rationally.
- When individuals transition from divine contemplations to the imperfect world of human affairs, they may struggle to adapt and behave in a ridiculous manner, much like someone who is compelled to fight in courts of law or other places about the images or shadows of justice without having seen absolute justice.
- The process of transitioning from a state of enlightenment to one of darkness, or vice versa, can cause bewilderment and weakness of vision, and it is important to consider the cause of this bewilderment before laughing or judging others, as noted by the concept that "anyone who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes".
- The capacity for learning and understanding exists within the soul already, as argued in the text, which also references notable figures such as Luther, Tolstoy, and Jesus' concept of the "holy spirit".
- If individuals were to be freed from the impediments of sensual pleasures and worldly desires from a young age, they would be able to see the truth as clearly as they see the things that they are currently focused on, and this is supported by the idea that "the very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as they see what their eyes are turned to now".
- Ultimately, the only life that looks down upon the life of political ambition is that of true philosophy, which is a key takeaway from the discussion.

## Socrates' Search for Wisdom and the True Philosopher
- The speaker, [[Socrates]], recounts his experiences of conversing with various individuals in Athens, including those who were thought to be wise, in order to understand the nature of true philosophy and wisdom.
- Socrates explains that he went to many people, including politicians, poets, and artisans, and found that those who were most renowned for their wisdom were often the most foolish, while others who were less esteemed were actually wiser and better.
- He notes that poets and artisans, although skilled in their crafts, often claimed to have knowledge of higher matters, but in reality, they did not understand the meaning of the things they said, and this lack of self-awareness overshadowed their wisdom.
- Socrates' inquisition and questioning of others led to him having many enemies, who accused him of being a troublemaker and a philosopher who teaches false ideas, such as having no gods and making the worse appear the better cause.
- The accusations against Socrates are largely based on misconceptions and a lack of understanding of his true intentions, which is to show that human wisdom is worth little or nothing, and that only [[God]] is truly wise.
- Socrates is aware that his actions and words may lead to an untimely end, but he is driven by a sense of necessity and a desire to follow the word of God, which he believes is more important than avoiding enmity or danger.
- Throughout his conversations and experiences, [[Socrates]] comes to realize that he has a slight advantage over others in that he is aware of his own ignorance, and he does not claim to have knowledge that he does not possess, whereas others often think they know more than they actually do.
- Ultimately, Socrates' goal is to understand the truth and to live a life of true philosophy, even if it means facing opposition and criticism from others, and he is willing to accept the consequences of his actions in order to follow his convictions.
- The speaker argues that a person who is good for anything should not calculate the chance of living or dying, but rather consider whether their actions are right or wrong, and that the fear of death is a pretence of wisdom, not real wisdom.
- The speaker believes that their mission as a philosopher is to search into themselves and others, and that deserting this post through fear of death would be strange and unjustified, as it would mean disobeying the oracle and fancying oneself wise when one is not.
- The speaker criticizes those who prioritize accumulating wealth, honor, and reputation over wisdom, truth, and the improvement of the soul, and claims that they reproach those who undervalue the greater and overvalue the less.
- The speaker's teaching is that virtue is not given by money, but rather that virtue comes first and is the source of all other goods, and that they persuade people to care about the improvement of their souls above all else.
- The speaker reflects on the idea that death may be a good, either as a state of nothingness and unconsciousness or as a migration of the soul to another world, and suggests that conversing with those in the afterlife would be a great delight.
- The speaker asks the judges to be of good cheer about death and to know that no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death, and requests that when their sons are grown up, they should be punished if they prioritize riches or anything else over virtue.
- The speaker's overall message is that one should prioritize virtue, wisdom, and the improvement of the soul above all else, and that death should not be feared, as it may be a transition to a better state, and that the unexamined life is not worth living.
- The speaker's philosophy is centered around the idea that one should strive to be a good person, and that this is the greatest good of man, and that one should not be afraid to question and examine oneself and others in pursuit of wisdom and virtue.

## Phaedo on the Pursuit of Knowledge and the Soul's Liberation
- The philosopher Phaedo discusses the concept that a true philosopher has reason to be of good cheer when facing death, as they have spent their life pursuing death and dying in a metaphorical sense, by constantly seeking to understand and attain the greatest good in the afterlife.
- According to Phaedo, the true votary of philosophy is likely to be misunderstood by other men, who do not perceive that the philosopher is always pursuing death and dying, and that the philosopher should not care about the pleasures of eating, drinking, or other bodily indulgences, but rather despise anything that exceeds nature's needs.
- The philosopher's primary concern is with the soul, not the body, and they strive to separate the soul from the body's influences, which are seen as distracting elements that hinder the acquisition of truth and knowledge, as noted in a conversation between Phaedo and Simmias.
- Phaedo argues that the purest knowledge can only be attained by using the mind alone, without the influence of sight or other senses, and that the body and its lusts are the source of wars, fightings, and factions, which distract from the pursuit of philosophy.
- The repetition of the question "Whence come wars, and fightings, and factions?" emphasizes the idea that these conflicts arise from the body and its desires, and that the love of money and the service of the body are the root causes of these impediments to philosophical inquiry.
- Ultimately, Phaedo concludes that pure knowledge can only be attained when the soul is separated from the body, and that this can only be achieved after death, at which point the soul will exist in itself alone and be able to behold things in themselves, allowing the attainment of the wisdom that philosophers desire.
- The pursuit of knowledge is most effectively achieved when one has minimal interaction with the body and its desires, and instead maintains a state of purity, as stated in the given text, which is a reflection of the ideas presented in the document 'Journal314_11-19'.
- According to the text, a person who fears death is likely not a lover of wisdom, but rather a lover of the body, and possibly also a lover of money or power, as they are reluctant to let go of the physical world.
- The founders of the mysteries are referenced as having a deeper meaning when they suggested that those who pass into the afterlife without purification will suffer, while those who arrive purified will dwell with the gods.
- The concept of absolute equality is discussed, with the idea that our understanding of equality is derived from a prior knowledge of its absolute form, which is a notion also explored by philosophers such as Descartes and Aquinas in their works, including Aquinas' 'fourth way'.
- A soul that is polluted by its association with the body and its desires will not be able to depart in a pure state, but will instead be held back by its corporeal nature, which is heavy and earthy, and will be depressed and dragged down into the visible world.
- Only those who have studied philosophy and are entirely pure at the time of their departure are allowed to enter the company of the gods, as they are the true lovers of knowledge.
- The true votaries of philosophy are characterized as abstaining from fleshly lusts and holding out against them, and they recognize that the soul was previously trapped and ignorant, but was freed by the pursuit of philosophy, which allowed it to view real existence in and through itself, rather than through the limitations of the physical body.
- The original state of the soul is one of confinement, caused by its own doing, and philosophy gently comforts and seeks to release it by pointing out the deceptiveness of the senses and encouraging the soul to trust in its own pure apprehension of pure existence.
- The soul of the true philosopher abstains from pleasures and desires, as well as pains and fears, in order to achieve deliverance, and this is because intense feelings of pleasure or pain can nail the soul to the body, making it believe in the truth of bodily affirmations and leading to a loss of purity.
- The philosopher [[Phaedrus (dialogue) | Phaedrus]] notes that he is still unable to know himself, as the Delphic inscription orders, and therefore does not concern himself with other things, instead looking into his own self and accepting what is generally believed.
- Those who have achieved holiness of life and have purified themselves with philosophy are released from the earthly prison and go to their pure home, where they dwell in a purer earth and live without the body in fairer mansions.
- The pursuit of knowledge and the adornment of the soul with virtues such as temperance, justice, courage, nobility, and truth are considered a glorious venture, and individuals who have sought after these pleasures should be of good cheer about their soul and its journey to the world below.

## Beauty, Truth, and the Human Experience
- The philosopher who stands outside human concerns and draws close to the divine may be thought to be mad by ordinary people, but is actually possessed by [[God | god]] and is like a bird fluttering and looking upward, careless of the world below.
- Few people retain an adequate remembrance of the other world, and when they behold an image of it, they are rapt in amazement, but are ignorant of what this rapture means because they do not clearly perceive, and everything can be beautiful only insofar as it partakes of absolute beauty.
- The provided text appears to be a collection of quotes and passages, likely from the works of [[Plato]], with added commentary and reflections from the author of the document 'Journal314_11-19', highlighting the importance of beauty, truth, and the human experience.
- The text describes the human perception of beauty and justice, noting that they are often seen imperfectly, and that only a few individuals can behold the true reality of these concepts, with the author drawing parallels between psychedelic experiences and philosophical introspection.
- The passage also explores the concept of love and the soul's response to beauty, describing the intense emotions and desires that arise when one encounters something beautiful, and how this experience can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself and the world.
- The author reflects on the importance of humility and modesty, citing Plato's mention of pride and the need for humility, and also touches on the value of discourse and the pursuit of knowledge, emphasizing that true understanding and wisdom can only be achieved through genuine effort and dedication.
- The text also critiques the written word and the concept of knowledge, suggesting that reliance on written characters can lead to forgetfulness and a lack of true understanding, with the author referencing Socrates' humility and the idea that true wisdom comes from within, and drawing connections to the ideas of other philosophers, such as [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]].
- The final passage mentions an ancient tradition from the temple of Dodona, where oaks were believed to have given prophetic utterances, adding a sense of historical and cultural context to the discussion, and highlighting the author's interest in exploring the intersections of philosophy, culture, and human experience.

## Truth, Morality, and the Human Perception of Reality
- The text from 'Journal314_11-19' discusses the concept of truth, morality, and the human perception of reality, highlighting that people often prioritize the speaker and their background over the actual truth being spoken.
- It critiques those who propose laws and write about justice and morality without truly understanding the nature of these concepts, considering such actions to be disgraceful, regardless of the applause they may receive from others.
- The text also touches on the idea that written words, whether in poetry or prose, hold little value if they are not meant to be critically evaluated or instructive, and that true principles of justice and goodness are best taught and communicated orally.
- The importance of inner beauty and the alignment of one's outward and inward self is emphasized, referencing the concept of the divided self discussed by philosophers like Tolstoy, [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], and [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]].
- The text quotes [[Bertrand Russell]], who describes the human condition as one of struggle and worship in a seemingly meaningless world, where people seek to find purpose and reverence something, even if it is not worthy.
- Russell's perspective is further explored, discussing how morality evolves and the demand for an ideal world begins to be felt, leading some to reject the idea of worshiping power and instead adopting a more religious stance, believing in a harmonious relationship between the world of fact and the world of ideals.
- The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of preserving respect for truth, beauty, and the ideal of perfection, even if these are not realized in the material world, and encouraging individuals to worship only the [[God]] created by their own love of the good, as expressed by Bertrand Russell.
- Additionally, the text mentions William Lane Craig and his work on the absurdity of life without God, providing a contrast to Russell's philosophical views.
- Overall, the text presents a philosophical discussion on the human search for meaning, morality, and truth, referencing various thinkers and ideas to explore these complex concepts.

## Freedom Through Thought and Aspiration
- The text from 'Journal314_11-19' discusses the concept of freedom and how it can be achieved through the power of thought and aspiration, allowing individuals to rise above the limitations and challenges of the physical world and the forces of fate that govern it.
- According to the text, true freedom comes only to those who no longer seek personal goods that are subject to the mutations of time, and instead learn to live with a vision of the good that guides their actions in the world of fact.
- The journey to this freedom is not an easy one, as it requires individuals to traverse a cavern of darkness, where they must confront and overcome their own desires and hopes, and ultimately undergo a process of self-renunciation, symbolized by the gate of despair, in order to emerge into the daylight of wisdom.
- The text also highlights the importance of contemplating fate and the forces of death, illness, poverty, and duty, which can help individuals to develop a sense of awe and reverence for the mystery of existence, and to transcend their petty desires and struggles.
- Through this contemplation, individuals can achieve a state of emancipation, where they are no longer bound by their desires and fears, and can instead burn with passion for eternal things, achieving a state of liberation that is characterized as the free man's worship.
- Ultimately, the text presents a bleak view of the human condition, where human life is brief and powerless, and subject to the relentless forces of fate and the universe, but suggests that it is precisely in the face of this reality that individuals must find a way to cultivate their ideals and find meaning in a seemingly purposeless world.

## The Absurdity of Human Existence and the Search for Meaning
- The concept of human existence is rooted in the idea that Man is the product of causes that had no prevision of the end they were achieving, and that his origin, growth, hopes, and fears are the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms, leading to the inevitable extinction of all human achievements in the vast death of the solar system.
- The pursuit of logic by great philosophers who were mystics, such as those discussed in the context of [[NT Research/Notes on Mystical/Mysticism]] and Logic, has been driven by a desire to understand the world, but often with a focus on convicting it of unreality in favor of a super-sensible "real" world, as seen in the works of philosophers like [[Plato]].
- The mystic emotion has led many philosophers to present their logical doctrines with a certain dryness, taking for granted the supposed insight of the mystic emotion, and believing their conclusions to be independent of the sudden illumination from which they sprang, as noted in the discussion of Symbolism.
- The concept of good and evil is subjective, and what is good or evil is merely a matter of the kind of feeling one has towards something, making it necessary to have a distinction of good and evil in active life, but this distinction belongs to the world of illusion, as mysticism regards it, and is essentially concerned with time.
- A philosophy that does not seek to impose its own conceptions of good and evil on the world is more likely to achieve truth and is the outcome of a higher ethical standpoint, as it involves an element of submission and a realization of the limits of human power, which is somewhat lacking in the modern world, as discussed in the context of religion and the views of philosophers like Plato.
- The submission inculcated by religion in action is essentially the same in spirit as that which science teaches in thought, and the ethical neutrality by which scientific victories have been achieved is the outcome of that submission, highlighting the importance of renunciation and the limits of human power in achieving a deeper understanding of the world.
- The concept of a higher reality and knowledge is discussed, referencing the idea that the greatest philosophers have sought to harmonize science and mysticism, as noted in the context of [[Socrates]] and Parmenides, with the latter advising not to despise even the meanest things, showcasing a genuine scientific temper that is more commonly associated with the temperament of a saint.
- The nature of reality is described as uncreated, indestructible, unchanging, and indivisible, with the idea that true belief has cast away coming into being and passing away, highlighting the negative side of the mystic's initiation, which involves doubting common knowledge to make way for higher wisdom.
- The elimination of ethical considerations from philosophy is argued to be both scientifically necessary and an ethical advance, as a scientific philosophy cannot demonstrate that the world has desirable ethical characteristics, and a truly scientific philosophy will be more humble and accepting of the world without imposing human demands.
- The philosopher [[Albert Camus]] is quoted, discussing the concept of the absurd, where a person who becomes conscious of the absurd is forever bound to it, and how this consciousness can arise from the weariness and monotony of daily life, leading to a definitive awakening and potentially consequences such as suicide or recovery.
- Camus also notes that recognizing one's place in time and acknowledging the inevitability of mortality can evoke a sense of horror and revolt, highlighting the absurdity of human existence, and how people can secretly harbor inhuman tendencies, which can become apparent in moments of lucidity, making their actions and surroundings seem meaningless.
- The concept of absurdity is explored in relation to human existence, where individuals must confront the fact that they cannot fully understand the world around them, and this realization can lead to a sense of despair, as noted in the passage "you wonder why he is alive" in the context of a man's incomprehensible actions.
- The idea of reconstructing a sense of peace and familiarity is deemed impossible, as stated in the phrase "we must despair of ever reconstructing the familiar, calm surface which would give us peace of heart," and instead, individuals must adapt to the absurdity of life and find a way to live with it, which is referred to as "decency" in the pursuit of a science.
- The absurd can be seen as a transcendent force that explains the world, but it is not something that can be logically understood, and instead, it requires a "leap" of faith, as described in the phrase "that existence which, suddenly and through a blind act of human confidence, explains everything."
- The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]] is referenced, who believed that antinomy and paradox are criteria of the religious, and that despair is not a fact, but a state of sin that alienates individuals from [[God]], as stated in the passage "despair is not a fact but a state: the very state of sin."
- The concept of the "absurd man" is introduced, who seeks truth and accepts the absurdity of life, even if it means embracing despair, as Kierkegaard warns, "if man had no eternal consciousness, if, at the bottom of everything, there were merely a wild, seething force producing everything, both large and trifling, in the storm of dark passions, if the bottomless void that nothing can fill underlay all things, what would life be but despair."
- The absurd man is willing to accept the universe as it is, without hope or consolation, and finds strength in this acceptance, as described in the phrase "he can then decide to accept such a universe and draw from it his strength, his refusal to hope, and the unyielding evidence of a life without consolation."
- The idea of suicide is also explored, as a form of acceptance of the absurd, and the concept of the "workman" is introduced, who is trapped in a life of repetitive tasks, and whose fate is absurd, but only becomes tragic when they become conscious of it, as stated in the passage "the workman of today works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is no less absurd."
- The philosophers Chestov and [[Franz Kafka | Kafka]] are also referenced, who believed that acceptance of the absurd is contemporaneous with the absurd itself, and that this acceptance can lead to a sense of hope and supernatural reality, as described in the phrase "it is through humility that hope enters in."
- Ultimately, the absurd man must find a way to live with the absurdity of life, and to find meaning and purpose in a seemingly meaningless world, which is a central theme in the works of philosophers like Kierkegaard, Chestov, and Kafka, as noted in the passage "like those of Kafka, Kierkegaard, or Chestov...They embrace the God that consumes them."

## Hope, Despair, and the Absurd Man
- The text discusses the idea that the course of life can lead to a higher power, specifically [[God]], and that this prospect offers a sense of hope and outcome beyond the human condition.
- Existential thought is noted to be rooted in a profound sense of hope, contrary to popular opinion, which allows individuals to transcend the limitations of their human existence.
- The work of author [[Franz Kafka | Kafka]] is cited as an example of universal and emotionally moving literature, as it portrays a character who, despite fleeing humanity and experiencing contradictions and despairs, finds reasons to believe and hope, with his work being described as having a religious inspiration.
- Emile Cioran's work "[[On the Heights of Despair]]" explores the idea that individuals should surrender to their inner fluidity and turmoil, rather than trying to objectify and express it, in order to experience a richer intensity of spiritual growth and inner development.
- Cioran suggests that attempting to organize and express one's inner experiences can be a rebellious and chaotic process, and that it would be more creative to simply immerse oneself in the inner struggle, allowing for a more authentic and intense experience of spiritual growth, as also noted by Molinos.
- He warns that repressing experiences that require objectification can be dangerous, as it can lead to an overwhelming power that cannot be restrained, and that salvation lies in confessing and expressing these experiences, even if it means that part of one's real self dies in the process.
- Cioran believes that the deepest subjective experiences are also the most universal, as they allow individuals to reach the original source of life, and that true interiorization leads to a universality that is inaccessible to those who remain on the periphery.
- He argues that the vulgar interpretation of universality is flawed, as it sees universality as a quantitative expansion rather than a qualitatively rich containment, and that lyricism is a peripheral and inferior phenomenon, whereas in reality, it shows remarkable freshness and depth, as seen in the ideas of Religious Symbolism by Tillich.
- Cioran notes that people often become lyrical in times of crisis, such as when they are in love or experiencing suffering, as these experiences actualize their personal resources and allow for a deeper expression of their inner infinity, and that there is no authentic lyricism without a grain of interior madness.
- He concludes that the lyrical state is a state beyond forms and systems, and that it is characterized by an inner drunkenness and a sense of infinite complexity, and ultimately, Cioran expresses a desire to retreat from the world and its complications, and to immerse oneself in the inner self, where one can experience a sense of actuality and spiritual content.

## Loneliness, Death, and the Meaning of Life
- The text from 'Journal314_11-19' discusses the human existence, loneliness, and the meaning of life, suggesting that renouncing culture and ambitions would result in losing everything and gaining nothing, as there is nothing to be gained from this world.
- The author expresses that people are closed off to one another, and even if they were totally open, they would see the depths of their souls and the destiny that awaits them, highlighting the loneliness that pervades human existence.
- The willingness to live and die in society is seen as a mark of great deficiency, and the author prefers the idea of dying alone and abandoned, without the melodramatic posturing that often accompanies death, unlike those who ask to be surrounded by friends due to fear and an inability to face death alone.
- The author criticizes those who adopt a pose on their deathbed to impress others, stating that tears do not burn except in solitude, and that those who want to be surrounded by friends when they die lack infinite heroism and want to forget death at the moment of death.
- The text also touches on the idea that everything is inaccessible to humans, and that the deepest and most organic death is death in solitude, where one is severed from life, love, smiles, friends, and even from death itself, leaving only the nothingness of the world and one's own nothingness.
- The author references the idea that some experiences are impossible to survive, and that once one has reached the limits of life, everyday gestures and usual aspirations lose their meaning, and that the most terrifying intensification bursts into nothingness, throwing one into an abyss of emptiness.
- The text mentions that mystics often feel that they cannot live after their great ecstasies, and that those who sense life, loneliness, despair, and death beyond normal limits cannot expect anything from this world, highlighting the passion for the absurd as the only thing that can throw a demonic light on chaos when all other reasons for living have been exhausted.
- The author questions whether philosophers like Tillich would agree with these ideas, and mentions the need for [[Johann Sebastian Bach | Bach]], referencing the composer's music as a potential solace in times of despair, and also references Heisman, although the context of this reference is unclear.

## Embracing the Absurd and Finding Meaning in the Useless
- The text discusses the concept of embracing the absurd and finding meaning in life through a connection with the useless and the illusion of life, which is reminiscent of Tillich's concrete religious symbols, and this idea is explored through various quotes and reflections.
- The author expresses a sense of being overwhelmed by the experiences and emotions that life offers, feeling like they are dying from solitude, love, despair, and hatred, and that each experience causes them to expand like a balloon blown up beyond its capacity, ultimately leading to a terrifying intensification that bursts into nothingness.
- The passion for the absurd is said to grow in individuals who have exhausted everything and are still capable of undergoing transfigurations, and for those who have lost everything, the only thing left is the passion for the absurd, which is what drives them to keep living, as they find solace in the fact that the mountains do not laugh and the worms do not sing.
- The author questions what could still move a person who has lost everything, suggesting that self-sacrifice, the public good, and the cult of the beautiful are not sufficient, and instead, they admire those who have done away with these things, even if only for a short time, because they have lived in an absolute manner and have the right to speak about life.
- The text also touches on the idea that only those who are sick or struggling are truly delighted by life and praise it, perhaps as a way to cope with their circumstances, and that true solitude is the feeling of being absolutely isolated between the earth and the sky, which can lead to a fearfully lucid intuition about the human condition and the infinite nothingness of the world.
- The author reflects on the importance of solitary walks and meditation, which can be both fertile and dangerous for the inner life, as they allow individuals to confront their own isolation and the drama of human existence, and it is through these solitary moments that one can gain a deeper understanding of the human condition, as referenced by the likes of Tillich and his concepts of concrete religious symbols.

## Solitary Walks, Interiorization, and the Agony Method
- The text discusses the concept of interiorization and spirituality, suggesting that solitary walks, especially in the evening, can lead to intense revelations about the world and oneself, as one detaches from life and confronts the "wound of life".
- The author quotes various phrases, including "I am: therefore the world is meaningless," and notes that life is a privilege of mediocre people, while those who are not mediocre are consumed by inner turmoil and live at temperatures that are barely sustainable.
- The author proposes the "agony method" as a means of achieving spiritual purification, involving the infliction of intense pain and suffering, such as through whip, fire, or injections, in order to induce a vision of death and bring about a radical transformation of life.
- The author references the idea of applying this method to every generation, citing the potential for cosmic transfiguration, and notes that this concept is similar to the idea of taking psychedelics, as suggested by McKenna.
- The text also explores the concept of agony, describing it as a precise and painful sensation, and notes that true agony occurs when one passes into nothingness through death, and that every agony bears a conclusive stamp, charting the progress of death in life.
- The author references the ideas of [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]] and Tillich, citing the concept of the "courage to be" and the feeling of wanting to die while being sorry for wanting to die, and notes that the complexity of the grotesque resides in its capacity to indicate an inner infinity and produce a paroxysm of the highest tension.
- The text concludes by discussing the fear of death and the fear of madness, suggesting that the latter is more complex and anxiety-provoking, as it involves a semi-presence and a loss of life while still living, and notes that the author would prefer a shower of warm light to fall from them, transfiguring the world, rather than experiencing ecstasy or madness.

## Transcendence, Light, and the Immanence of Death
- The text describes a state of being where the world is filled with light and delight, and obstacles, matter, and limits no longer exist, allowing one to transcend the mundane and experience a sense of freedom and euphoria.
- The quotes mentioned in the text touch on the idea that certain questions or pursuits can be so profound and dangerous that they can either isolate or destroy an individual, leaving them with nothing to lose and a newfound sense of seriousness and purpose.
- According to the text, only an organic and existential thinker, such as [[God | the one]] described, is capable of achieving this level of seriousness, as they are driven by a vital imbalance and a desire to uncover the truth, rather than simply engaging in abstract speculation or intellectual pursuits for their own sake, as noted by Huxley in relation to art, but also applicable to philosophy.
- The text also explores the concept of death, suggesting that it is not just a physical event, but rather a discovery that can be made in the course of life, where one can find the immanent abyss of death in life's vital signs, and that this understanding can be a transformative experience.
- The text concludes by questioning why the experience of agony, which is often a catalyst for profound transformation and growth, is so rare, implying that it is a crucial aspect of the human experience that is often overlooked or avoided.

## The Metaphysics of Death and the Black Drunkenness
- The hypothesis that a metaphysics of death can be sketched is challenged by the idea that death has a transcendental nature that must be accepted in order to truly understand it, and this understanding can only be achieved by acknowledging the presence of death in every step of life.
- The average person is unaware of the progressive advance into death that occurs with every step in life, but when consciousness becomes independent of life, the revelation of death becomes overwhelming and destroys any sense of naiveté, joyful enthusiasm, and natural voluptuousness.
- The experience of death's presence is described as a state of "black drunkenness" that is necessary for great transfigurations to arise, and it is characterized by an awareness of the demonic character of life and the state of inner effervescence that it provokes.
- The revelation of death's immanence in life can occur during illnesses and long depressive states, which bring individuals closer to their inner reality and cause them to discover death in their own subjectivity, leading to a growing interiority that progresses toward the essential center of subjectivity.
- Those who truly suffer are capable of genuine content and infinite seriousness, and they often obtain metaphysical revelations through despair, agony, and death, which can be preferable to a naive love or the voluptuous unconsciousness of dance.
- The fear of death is a fundamental aspect of human existence, and it is impossible to eliminate it through artificial reasoning, as it is an organic fear that is deeply rooted in the human experience, and even those who believe in eternity do so because they are afraid of death and seek to save the world of values in which they live.
- The belief in eternity is seen as a necessary consolation for historical man, but it is ultimately an illusion that will be demonstrated by the catastrophic ending of the tragedy of life and of man in particular, and the effort to defeat the nothingness inherent in the temporal and attain the universal in eternity is a painful and uncertain one.

## The Fear of Death and the Illusion of Eternity
- The concept of death without religious faith is believed to leave nothing standing, and various philosophies and doctrines often fail to address death or offer only silence or despair in response.
- Some individuals argue that the fear of death is unjustified, as the self ceases to exist upon death, but this perspective neglects the phenomenon of gradual agony and offers little comfort to those who are deeply aware of their own mortality.
- Philosophers are often criticized for their hypocritical serenity in the face of death, as they may be more fearful of death than others, and their attempts to address existential questions through logic are ultimately null and void.
- The process of dying is considered an individual and intensely personal experience, and there is no technique or set of rules that can be learned to prepare for it, with most people only becoming aware of their own mortality in the moments immediately preceding death.
- The idea of nothingness as a form of salvation is also explored, but it is argued that salvation is unlikely to be found in either existence or non-existence, leading to a desire to reject the world and its laws.
- Melancholy is discussed as a state that can lead to a sense of expansion towards nothingness, characterized by weariness and a separation from the world, which can ultimately lead to a deeper understanding of the self and the world.
- The experience of melancholy is also associated with a sense of loneliness and detachment from the world, but this can be accompanied by a sense of voluptuousness and a appreciation for the strange beauty of the world, despite the disparity between human finitude and the world's infinity.
- Ultimately, the text concludes that nothing is truly important, and the suffering and thoughts of the individual are insignificant in the grand scheme of things.

## Individual Insignificance and the Rejection of the World
- The author of the text believes that their presence in the world will have a disturbing effect on others, and they are aware of the significant impact their tragedy will have, despite feeling totally insignificant in the grand scheme of the universe.
- The author is convinced that they are nothing in the universe, yet they feel that their existence is the only real one, and they would choose to reject the world and its laws in order to maintain their individuality and glide alone in absolute nothingness.
- The author discusses the concept of metaphysical existentialism, which is born out of ecstasy in front of the world's primordial origins, and is the ultimate intoxication, ecstatic bliss in the contemplation of essence, and they wonder whether a truly metaphysical feeling is even possible without the disappearance of superficial forms.
- The author also explores the idea that solitude is the proper milieu for madness, and that even skeptics can experience ecstasy, which reveals itself through a combination of certitude and essence with doubt and despair, and they note that abstract doubt is more frequent, but less intense than despair.
- The author distinguishes between doubt and despair, stating that doubt is anxiety about problems and things, and has its origins in the unsolvable nature of all big questions, whereas despair is a more profound and intense state that arises from one's own subjective existence, and they argue that a genuinely desperate person cannot forget their own tragedy and is always aware of their painful actuality.
- The state of despair is characterized by anxiety and restlessness, where individuals suffer from their own inner torment, and it is noted that nobody commits suicide solely because problems in the world cannot be solved, as stated in the context of the 'Journal314_11-19' document.

## Inner Hell, Spiritual Richness, and Superconsciousness
- According to [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], one must experience the depths of inner hell to turn their destiny into a subjective yet universal problem, highlighting the importance of introspection and self-awareness in understanding one's existence.
- The concept of a rich spiritual life is discussed, where great and dangerous contradictions are seen as a sign of a vibrant inner life, and it is argued that only those who experience chaos and the turmoil of illness can truly be considered creators, as they are able to tap into the abundant inner flow of life.
- The author expresses a fascination with death, acknowledging its grandeur and infinity, but also confessing that their despair is so vast that they do not even harbor the hope of death, and instead can only write about it in contradictory ways, echoing the sentiments of Kierkegaard.
- The idea that only those who do not think or only think about life's bare necessities are happy is presented, suggesting that true thinking is a demon that muddies the spring of life, and that constant questioning and doubting can lead to exhaustion and weariness, as noted in the 'Journal314_11-19' document.
- The author ponders the possibility of becoming an animal who knows the history of philosophy, or even a superman, but ultimately concludes that the only solution may be to live beyond the complexities of consciousness and anxiety in a sphere of superconsciousness, where access to eternity is no longer a myth, and where one can experience a state of immaterial purity.
- The author expresses a sense of renunciation and non-movement, feeling that working towards social and political systems, or fighting for moral and aesthetic ideals, is ultimately too little, and instead yearns for a state of superconsciousness where the intoxication of eternity would do away with the qualms of this world, as discussed in the context of the 'Journal314_11-19' document.

## Innocence, Renunciation, and Cosmic Loneliness
- The concept of innocence is explored, where it is suggested that not everybody loses their innocence, and that disintegration implies a total loss of innocence, which is destroyed by knowledge and life's enemy, and that the only remaining option is heroism, which means aspiring to absolute triumph, but ultimately leads to transcending life and a fatal leap into nothingness.
- The author discusses the idea that spirit in life is an anomaly, and that renunciation is an illness of the spirit, and that they have renounced so much, including the idea of a theory of knowledge, which they feel is irrelevant in a world that does not deserve to be known, as noted in the 'Journal314_11-19' document.
- The feeling of cosmic loneliness is described, which stems from an awareness of the world's isolation and objective nothingness, and the author expresses a desire for people to relinquish their duties and responsibilities and gather in the streets to refuse to do anything anymore, in a gesture of rebellion against the mediocrity of a sterile and insignificant life, echoing the sentiments of [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]] and the concept of Karma Yoga and Maya.
- The author concludes by declaring that ideals, beliefs, art, and philosophy are all void, and that the only remaining feeling is one of utter confusion, where one is unable to differentiate, clarify, understand, or appreciate, and that this feeling would make any philosopher a poet, as discussed in the context of the 'Journal314_11-19' document.

## From Philosopher to Poet: The Transformation through Absolute Confusion
- The transformation of a philosopher into a poet is a dramatic process, where one falls from a world of abstractions into a whirlwind of feelings and emotions, making it impossible to continue philosophizing in a systematic way, as seen in the experiences of those who have started with abstract forms and ended in absolute confusion, and can only philosophize poetically.
- The state of absolute confusion is characterized by the delights and torments of madness, where only the most intense feelings matter, and this is reflected in the idea that "only sickness gives birth to serious and deep feelings," as well as the notion that "he who has not experienced absolute fear, universal anxiety, cannot understand struggle, the madness of the flesh and of death."
- The concept of grace is described as an illusory state where life transcends its contradictions and negativity, but it does not lead to metaphysical revelations or a vision of truth, and instead, it is the experience of eternity that depends on the intensity of subjective feeling, as noted in the phrase "the experience of eternity therefore depends on intensity of subjective feeling, and the way to eternity is to transcend the temporal."
- The idea of morality is also discussed, with the argument that it cannot be saved and that reality is essentially irrational, making it pointless to distinguish between right and wrong, as stated in the text "even today nobody can tell what is right or what is wrong...since reality is essentially irrational, why set rules, why distinguish the right from the wrong?"
- The author also touches on the idea that eternity does not lead to the triumph of either good or evil, but rather ravages all, and that suffering and pleasure are both insignificant in the face of nothingness, as seen in the quote "whether you suffer or not, nothingness will swallow you forever," which is reminiscent of the concept of maya discussed by [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]].
- The text also references the ideas of various philosophers and thinkers, including Vivekananda, Tillich, [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], and St. Therese, who have all grappled with the concepts of doubt, faith, and the infinite, and how these ideas relate to the human experience of eternity and the search for meaning.
- Ultimately, the author concludes that the experience of eternity is void of life, and that time and history are irrelevant, as stated in the phrase "time with its long train of individual moments is, if not unreal, irrelevant...without temporality, life loses its dramatic character," and that one should strive to outstrip history and live in a state of indifference to the past, present, and future, as noted in the text "why should i live in history, or worry about the social and cultural problems of the age? i am weary of culture and history; i can no longer bring myself to embrace its torments and its aspirations."

## Eternity, History, and Disillusionment with Humanity
- The author finds comfort in contemplating eternity, believing that the only valid relation is between man and eternity, rather than between man and history, as outstripping history allows one to acquire superconsciousness and enter a realm where contradictions and doubts lose their meaning.
- The author expresses a sense of disillusionment with humanity, stating that they are not proud to be a man because they are aware of the suffering and tragedy that exists in the world, and that only those who have not experienced this state intensely are proud of being human.
- The author discusses the limitations of magic in dealing with metaphysical reality, suggesting that it is useful for small and inessential things but powerless when confronted with the reality of fatality and the impotence of human existence.
- The author critiques the idea that joy is the only means of salvation, arguing that it is easy to recommend joy to those who are suffering, but that true joy must come from within, and that external help is useless if it does not spring from inner resources.
- The author advocates for fully living one's inner tragedy and agony, rather than trying to overcome them, and suggests that intense subjectivity is the way to attain universality and enter eternity through the instant.
- The author values solitude and intense subjectivity, believing that they are essential for attaining universality and entering eternity, and expresses admiration for enthusiasts who are able to be constantly reborn and live a life that is opaque to death.
- The author notes that the pursuit of immortality through great achievements is ultimately futile, as everything will eventually crumble into dust, and that even the greatest accomplishments, such as those of [[Johann Sebastian Bach | Bach]], will be lost to time.
- The author concludes that true understanding and connection to eternity can only be achieved through individual, subjective experience, and that external values and achievements are ultimately meaningless in the face of death and nothingness.

## The Enthusiast, the Problematic Man, and the Nature of Ecstasy
- The text explores the concept of the enthusiast, who is described as an unproblematic person, understanding many things without experiencing agonizing doubts or chaotic sensitivity, and is characterized by their gift of abandon and naive irrationality.
- In contrast, the problematic man is unable to solve anything due to his dissatisfaction with everything, and true knowledge is seen as a tenebrous darkness that brings tragedy, with the biblical myth of knowledge as sin being the most profound myth ever invented.
- The text also discusses the concept of ecstasy, which is described as a sensation in which one feels they are dying due to the intensity of light and darkness, and is often associated with oriental religions and [[NT Research/Notes on Mystical/Mysticism| mysticism]], revealing inner shadows and glimmers of light that give an impression of metaphysical hallucination.
- The author reflects on the idea of renunciation, citing the example of ascetics who renounce life and flee into the desert, believing they have overcome human weaknesses, but ultimately betraying their inability to free themselves from their own contempt for humanity and pleasure.
- The author argues that suffering and the consciousness of its inescapability can lead to renunciation, but emphasizes the importance of not condemning others' joy, as there is much envy in every act of condemnation, and instead suggests that one should not spoil another's enjoyment with their own knowledge of pain, old age, and death.
- Ultimately, the text presents a nuanced exploration of the human experience, highlighting the complexities of knowledge, ecstasy, and renunciation, and encouraging a more compassionate and understanding approach to others, rather than one of condemnation or contempt.

## Renunciation, Infinity, and the Human Experience of Suffering
- The text from 'Journal314_11-19' explores various philosophical and existential themes, including the concepts of renunciation, infinity, and the human experience of suffering, with references to Buddhism and [[Christianity]] as examples of how people cope with suffering.
- The author discusses the idea that a world full of philosophers would be terrifying, and that they should be wiped out to allow life to proceed naturally, highlighting the preference for vital, organic truths over abstract wisdom, as seen in the works of Taoism and the discussions of Sean Carroll on the multi-verse.
- The text touches on the essence of social life being injustice, and the idea that infinity, both in time and space, leads to nothing, making it difficult to accomplish anything in the future, with the author referencing their own earthly reflections on poverty.
- The author also explores the concept of absolute becoming and the destructive power of infinity, which dissolves all forms into a fluidity, much like music, and wonders why great composers have not all gone mad, given the intense concentration required for their creative work.
- The importance of overcoming banality and embracing transfiguration is emphasized, with the author suggesting that work is the negation of eternity, and that a feeling for eternity is destroyed by frenetic activity and trepidation, citing the thoughts of Tillich and Tolstoy on inward reflection.
- The text contrasts the limited perspective of active and energetic people with the keener perception of metaphysical reality held by the lazy, preferring an intelligent and observant laziness to intolerable activity, and referencing the idea that Saints are Conquerors and the concept of Quietism as an undying participation with Nothingness, as discussed by Underhill.
- The author reflects on the themes of sadness, anxiety, and the joy of nothingness, suggesting that existence may be exile, and nothingness, home, and that life should be lived with the speed and intensity of a lightning bolt, with each action being either triumph or fall.
- The text also explores the idea that when men can no longer bear the monotony of ordinary existence, they may find in experiences of the absolute an opportunity to commit suicide, and that suffering is not a path to love, but rather a descent into hell, with the author referencing the satanic essence of suffering.
- The concept of disjunction from the world through suffering is discussed, leading to excessive interiorization and a high level of consciousness, making the world seem exterior and transcendent, and the author notes that despite the pain of agony and isolation, the distance from the world renders it more accessible, highlighting the pantheistic paradox.
- Finally, the text emphasizes the importance of the immediate, citing Jesus' teachings on anxiety about tomorrow, and suggesting that man has lost touch with the immediate, and that there's no salvation without it, with the author referencing their own thoughts on the matter.

## The Present Moment, Subjectivity, and the Absurdity of Life
- The text from 'Journal314_11-19' discusses various philosophical ideas, including the concept of the present moment, as mentioned by [[The Buddha | Buddha]], and the idea that all salvation comes from embracing the notion that there is no truth.
- The author suggests that an excess of subjectivity can lead to megalomania or self-denigration, and that individuals should stop being rational animals and instead become lunatics, risking everything for their fantasies and being capable of exaltations.
- The idea that "nothing matters" is a recurring theme, with the author arguing that everything is possible and yet nothing is, and that all is permitted and yet nothing, highlighting the absurdity and meaninglessness of life.
- The author also critiques the concept of morality, suggesting that it is incompatible with generosity and that true morality begins when we have done with morality, and that vice is a tragedy of the flesh that bursts out of its own fatality.
- The text also touches on the idea that efforts to attain happiness are futile, and that unhappiness is a path of no return, with the author questioning the point of achieving something and suggesting that it would be better for individuals to stand still in calm and silent immobility.
- Ultimately, the author concludes that the only answer and reality is silence, and that expressing opinions, taking stands, and making impressions are useless, highlighting the absurdity and nonsensical nature of human actions and endeavors.

## Knowledge, Ego-Death, and the Nihilistic Experience
- The text discusses various philosophical and psychological concepts, including the idea that having too much knowledge can be overwhelming and lead to a sense of disgust, as stated by Cioran, who notes that "a little knowledge is delightful; a lot, disgusting" and that the more one knows, the less they want to know.
- Cioran also describes the concept of "ego-death" and the Nihilistic experience, which is compared to a religious experience, but is also referred to as "madness" in a pejorative sense, drawing parallels with the ideas of Eckhart, [[John of the Cross]], [[Augustine of Hippo | Augustine]], and Luther.
- The text quotes Cioran as saying that "fine psychological understanding is the product of a life of self-contemplation, a life which sees itself in other lives as if in so many mirrors," and that this understanding can lead to a sense of boredom and disconnection from others.
- The concept of time is also discussed, with Cioran describing it as "an ever-growing nothingness, a dilating void, a threat from beyond," and the text notes that this perspective is shared by other philosophers, including Tillich, who believed that the meaning of life is to despair over the meaninglessness of life.
- The text also explores the idea of escaping one's fate and the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world, with Cioran suggesting that "to escape our fate— what is the good of striving for that?" and that instead, one should focus on finding a way to subsist in the peace of decay, amid the benefits of decrepitude.
- Additionally, the text touches on the idea of the abyss, which is described as being both within and outside of oneself, and is seen as a presentiment of yesterday, a question of today, and a certainty of tomorrow, echoing the ideas of [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], who believed in the importance of turning inward and renouncing selflessness.
- The text also quotes Cioran as saying that "since in us has awakened the evil that slumbered in the remainder of the living, it remains for us to destroy ourselves so that they might be saved," highlighting the theme of selflessness and self-abnegation, and rejecting the idea of a personal [[God]], which is a key tenant of the Nihilistic Mystical experience.
- Finally, the text describes a post-apocalyptic scenario in which the survivors of a catastrophic event seek to abolish the memory of the old humanity and erase all traces of the past, instead embracing a new way of living that values oblivion and unlearning, with Cioran noting that "one rachitic tree will be worth more in their eyes than a museum or a temple," and that the focus will be on "courses in oblivion and unlearning to celebrate the virtues of inattention and the delights of amnesia."

## The Decline of Knowledge, Literalism, and the Search for Spiritual Unity
- The text from 'Journal314_11-19' discusses various philosophical and spiritual concepts, including the potential decline of interest in knowledge and the rejection of literalism, as hinted at by Vivekananda's quote "good to be born in church, but not die in a church", which suggests a need for spiritual progression and unity among different sects.
- The author reflects on the idea that humanity is facing a crisis, having lost its old beliefs and lacking any metaphysical assets, which is described as a "death agony" and a "débâcle", and that this realization could lead to a moment of pause and introspection, potentially revealing the true nature of the crisis and inspiring prayers or lamentations.
- The text also explores the relationship between faith and understanding, with the author suggesting that having faith is not necessary to understand spiritual concepts, as evidenced by the quote "What advantage would having faith be to me, since I understand [[Meister Eckhart]] just as well without it?"
- The author touches on the idea that true dialogue and understanding can only be achieved through a "mute dialogue with our enemies", implying that friendship and truth are incompatible, and that this dialogue can be a fruitful and meaningful way to engage with others.

- The text includes quotes and references to various philosophers and spiritual leaders, including Meister Eckhart, Plotinus, and Ramana Maharshi, and discusses the idea that true understanding and spiritual experience are rare and difficult to put into words, as illustrated by the story of the Tantric ritual, where the initiate is given a mirror to contemplate their own insignificance.
- The author also reflects on the human condition, noting that "to be is to be cornered" and that people are often driven by a desire to change others, rather than accepting them for who they are, as seen in the example of the friend who urges the author to change their ways, and that this desire to change others can be a form of rejection.
- The text concludes with the idea that true understanding and freedom can only be achieved by letting go of hope and desire, as the author states "One is and remains a slave as long as one is not cured of hoping", and that this realization can be a difficult and painful process, but ultimately necessary for true liberation.

## Rejection of Resignation, Weariness, and the Blurring of Good and Evil
- The rejection of resignation is seen as a sign of "life" rather than a sign of perspicacity or reflection, and it is noted that the sane man never lowers himself to protest or indignation, as taking human affairs seriously may attest to some secret flaw.
- The author reflects on their own struggles, stating that they do not struggle against the world, but against their own weariness of the world, and that they have less and less discernment between good and evil, wondering what it would mean to reach a point where they make no distinction between the two.
- The author also touches on the idea that as one advances in age, they become more concerned with honors and vanity, which can be a way of clinging to trifles in order to avoid realizing the nothingness that they conceal.
- The text also explores the idea that trying to cure someone of a "vice" is to attack their very being, and that the only profound thinkers are those who do not suffer from a sense of the ridiculous, while humorists are the ones who have discerned the inanity of all that is serious and frivolous.
- The author shares a childhood memory of being shocked by their father's story of a young mother who burst out laughing at her baby daughter's funeral, and notes that this reaction is not entirely uncommon, as people may feel a craving to react with hilarity in the face of absolute deception.

- The text also discusses the idea that life is more and less than boredom, and that boredom is a way of discerning what life is worth, while suffering is localized, whereas boredom is an evil without site or support that erodes a person slowly.
- The author notes that habituation to life is the greatest vice of all, which is why it is so difficult to rid oneself of it, and that even when they are satisfied with everything, they immediately react with anxiety about the impermanence of things, such as the sun exploding in a few billion years.
- Finally, the author concludes that of two enemies at odds, it is unlikely that only one is in the right, and that the only ones entitled to grumble are individual beings, who are pitiable victims of a passing fancy, with the author referencing the ideas of Tillich in their discussion of boredom and suffering.

- Additionally, the quotes critique the idea of a meaningful and purposeful life, with statements such as "When someone complains that his life has come to nothing, we need merely remind him that life itself is an analogous situation, if not worse," and "Beatitude is not compatible with this world," highlighting the tension between the desire for happiness and fulfillment and the inherent suffering and impermanence of life.
- The author also touches on the limitations of language and the need for symbolism and myth, as well as the idea of religious pluralism and anti-literalism, suggesting that all beliefs are superficial and govern only appearances, and that true understanding requires a deeper level of perception and awareness, as expressed in the phrase "And to understand signifies to discern the degree of awakening to which a being has achieved, in his capacity to perceive the sum of unreality which enters into each phenomenon."
- Overall, the section presents a complex and nuanced exploration of the human condition, encouraging readers to question their assumptions and perceptions, and to consider the possibility of a more profound and meaningful existence through the cultivation of a taste for the void and the adoption of a more renunciative and selfless approach to life.

## Liberation, the Void, and the Nature of Mysticism
- The concept of liberation is discussed, where it is noted that initial freedom can lead to a paralysis of impulses and a clinging to fascination, as stated by the author, highlighting the idea that we cling to anything to avoid tearing ourselves away from the primal dazzle that keeps us from discerning the nonreality in everything.
- The void is described as the liquidation of the adventure of the 'I', being without any trace of being, and a blessed engulfment, with references to psychedelics and psylocibin, and the idea that even the Buddha after illumination was only [[The Buddha | Siddhartha Gautama]] with additional knowledge, as mentioned by Mckenna, who also stated that 'no one knows what's going on here'.
- The perception of the void is said to coincide with the perception of the whole, and the entrance into [[God | the All]], with the author noting that even if the experience of the void were only a deception, it would still deserve to be tried, as it attempts to reduce to nothing both life and death, making them endurable to us.
- The concept of [[NT Research/Notes on Mystical/Mysticism| mysticism]] is explored, with the author stating that it is a mistake to suppose that mysticism derives from a softening of the instincts, and instead, mystics are conquerors, as seen in the example of Hernando Cortez, and that participation in mysticism is hard work, requiring intense thinking about death and the meaninglessness of life.
- The idea that all great conversions are born from the sudden revelation of life's meaninglessness is discussed, with the author noting that everything is nothing, and God is the positive expression of nothingness, and that without God, everything is nothingness, but God is the supreme nothingness, as seen in the writings of [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]] and the concept of Maya.
- The importance of thinking intensely about death and the metaphysical consciousness is emphasized, with the author stating that science has dulled people's minds by diminishing their metaphysical consciousness, and that a great scholar who is nothing but that is inferior to an illiterate peasant haunted by final questions.
- The concept of God is explored, with the author noting that God benefits from the peripheries of logic, and that one can say or think anything about him, and that he who does not think of God will forever remain a stranger to himself, as stated by Tillich, and that God is self-knowledge, and universal history is a description of his various forms.
- The idea that theology is the negation of divinity, and that looking for proofs of God is a crazy idea, is discussed, with the author stating that theology is the atheist's mode of believing, and that only by thinking about God constantly and mercilessly can we win rich spoils in our battle with him, as seen in the examples of Tolstoy and the need for a change in one's life.

## Theology, Divinity, and the Obscurity of Mystical Concepts

- The author references the idea that God's nature is such that one can say or think anything about him, and that the less one tries to connect their thoughts and the more one abandons them to contradictions, the closer one may come to the truth, highlighting the importance of symbolism and the peripheries of logic in understanding the divine.
- The text ultimately presents a vision of spirituality and faith that is deeply personal, intuitive, and rooted in the human experience, and suggests that true wisdom and understanding can be achieved through a combination of meditation, suffering, and a willingness to confront the unknown and the absurd.

- The text also explores the relationship between [[God]] and human existence, with quotes like "God...is he anything but the fateful moment when our life totters on the brink of destruction?" and "Let God pray for the man in whom there is nothing left to die!", suggesting that the concept of God is closely tied to the human experience of mortality and the search for meaning.
- The idea that "life is an uninterrupted religious crisis, superficial for believers and shattering for doubters" is also presented, along with the notion that "the ultimate goal of all religions: life as a diminution of the soul," which is contrasted with the idea that "All that if Life in me urges me to give up God," reflecting the complex and often contradictory nature of human spirituality.
- Additionally, the text touches on the themes of detachment, renunciation, and the search for transcendence, with statements like "Detachment is a negation of both life and death" and "Spirit means renunciation...when people, not having experienced spiritual torture, satisfy their thirst for renunciation through a derivative: heroism," highlighting the tension between the desire for spiritual enlightenment and the temptation of worldly distractions.

## The Unattainable Nature of Satisfaction and the Hope of an Afterlife
- The passage from 'Journal314_11-19' discusses the human condition, emphasizing that true and lasting satisfaction is unattainable in life, and that our existence is marked by infinite evils and the inevitability of death, which can lead to either annihilation or unhappiness.
- According to [[Blaise Pascal | Pascal]], the only source of happiness in life is the hope of an afterlife, and those who have no insight into eternity are devoid of happiness, making it a great evil to be in doubt about one's existence, but an indispensable duty to seek answers when in doubt.
- The passage criticizes individuals who are content with their ignorance and boast about it, arguing that it is unreasonable to find joy in the expectation of nothing but hopeless misery, and that a reasonable person would seek to understand the mysteries of existence, including the nature of the universe, the self, and the meaning of life.
- Pascal also quotes himself, stating that physical science cannot console him for the ignorance of morality in times of affliction, highlighting the limitations of scientific knowledge in addressing fundamental human questions and the importance of considering one's place in the universe.
- The passage references other philosophers, including [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], Tolstoy, Kempis, Huxley, and [[The Buddha | Buddha]], noting that most people are not philosophers and do not ask fundamental questions about existence, and that individuals who do not seek to understand the mysteries of life are ultimately unhappy and unfulfilled.
- Ultimately, the passage encourages individuals to reflect on their existence, consider their place in the universe, and seek to understand the true value of earthly things, including the earth, kingdoms, cities, and themselves, in order to find meaning and purpose in life.

## Man in the Infinite and the Limits of Human Comprehension
- The concept of a man in the Infinite is described as being part of an infinity of universes, each with its own firmament, planets, and earth, filled with animals and tiny creatures, showcasing the vastness and complexity of the universe.
- According to the text, man is a mean between nothing and everything, infinitely removed from comprehending the extremes, and is therefore incapable of seeing the Nothing from which he was made and the Infinite in which he is swallowed up, as noted by the author.
- The author criticizes men for rashly rushing into the examination of nature without contemplating the Infinites, and instead suggests that we should acknowledge our limitations, recognizing that we are something, but not everything, and that our existence hides from us the knowledge of first beginnings and the sight of the Infinite.
- The text also quotes [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], who describes the human condition as being incapable of certain knowledge and of absolute ignorance, sailing in a vast sphere of uncertainty, driven from end to end, and seeking solid ground and an ultimate sure foundation, but finding that our whole groundwork cracks and the earth opens to abysses.
- The author further notes that even the duration of our life is equally removed from eternity, and that our attempts to find certainty and stability are often in vain, as illustrated by the example of magistrates and physicians who use imaginary knowledge and disguises to inspire respect.
- The text also mentions that soldiers and kings, on the other hand, establish themselves by force and might, rather than by show or disguises, and that it takes a refined reason to regard a powerful leader, such as the Grand Turk, as an ordinary man, despite being surrounded by guards, halberdiers, and other symbols of power.

## Distraction and Diversion as a Means of Avoiding Inner Emptiness
- The text from 'Journal314_11-19' discusses the human condition, highlighting that people often seek distractions and diversions to avoid feeling their own nothingness, forlornness, and insufficiency, as noted by [[Blaise Pascal | Pascal]], who suggests that this emptiness is observed through non-movement and a turning inward.
- According to the text, the consciousness of the falsity of present pleasures and the ignorance of the vanity of absent pleasures cause inconstancy in humans, leading them to constantly seek new experiences and distractions, such as play, the society of women, war, and high posts, in an attempt to find happiness.
- The text also quotes Pascal, stating that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact, that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber, and that a man who has enough to live on, if he knew how to stay with pleasure at home, would not leave it to go to sea or to besiege a town, implying that true happiness can be found in rest and quiet contemplation.
- Furthermore, the text notes that people have a secret instinct that impels them to seek amusement and occupation abroad, which arises from the sense of their constant unhappiness, and another instinct that teaches them that happiness in reality consists only in rest, and not in stir, resulting in a confused idea that hides itself from their view, inciting them to aim at rest through excitement.
- The text also touches on the idea that people often seek excitement and distractions as a means to escape their troubles and difficulties, such as the example of a man who has lost his son or is troubled by lawsuits and quarrels, but is able to forget his troubles by focusing on a distraction, like a hunt, highlighting the human tendency to seek diversion and avoidance of introspection.

## The Pursuit of Happiness Through Amusement and Diversion
- The text from 'Journal314_11-19' discusses the human tendency to seek happiness and fulfillment through amusement and diversion, noting that even the happiest person can become discontented without some form of occupation or passion to prevent weariness from overcoming them.

- The author reflects on their own experience of studying abstract sciences and feeling disheartened by the lack of fellow students, illustrating the sense of alienation that can come from pursuing intellectual pursuits.
- The text also explores the human desire to live an imaginary life in the mind of others, seeking to shine and be esteemed by others, even if it means neglecting one's true self and values, as seen in the tendency to prioritize reputation over actual virtues.
- The author critiques the vanity of human nature, noting that people are often more concerned with being known and admired by others, even after they are gone, and that this desire for esteem can be fleeting and superficial, as evidenced by the fact that people are often satisfied with the esteem of just a few neighbors.
- The text references various philosophers, including Audi, [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], Cioran, and Otto, who have written about the rarity of the nihilistic belief and the tendency for people to be absorbed in fame, diversion, and the thought of the future, rather than recognizing the vanity of the world.
- Ultimately, the author suggests that recognizing the vanity of the world is a rare and surprising insight, and that those who do not see it are often themselves vain and caught up in the pursuit of greatness and esteem.

## Diversion, Self-Reflection, and the Christian Faith
- The human condition is marked by a tendency to seek diversion from the realities of life, such as death, misery, and ignorance, in order to avoid feelings of unhappiness and weariness, as noted by philosophers like Kierkegaard and Maya.
- According to these philosophers, diversion is a double-edged sword, as it provides temporary consolation for our miseries, but also hinders us from reflecting on ourselves and ultimately leads to our downfall, making it a significant obstacle to true self-awareness and understanding.
- The [[Christianity | Christian faith]], in a symbolic sense, emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the corruption of human nature and the need for redemption, highlighting the significance of considering one's own state and the eternal consequences of their actions.
- Humans have a peculiar relationship with their own mortality, often being indifferent to the loss of their existence and the perils of everlasting suffering, while being deeply concerned with trivial matters, demonstrating a strange confusion in human nature.
- The philosopher argues that it is essential to acknowledge and confront the reality of one's own state, rather than disguising or ignoring it, and that the search for truth and understanding is crucial in navigating the complexities of human existence.
- The text also critiques those who live in indifference to the search for truth, particularly in matters of eternal significance, and emphasizes the importance of regulating one's actions and thoughts according to the truth of one's ultimate end, in order to live a life of sense and judgment.
- Ultimately, the philosopher urges readers to take seriously the importance of considering their own state and the eternal consequences of their actions, and to be horrified by conduct that is extravagant and ignorant of these realities, as expressed by the philosopher's statement that nothing reveals more an extreme weakness of mind than not to know the misery of a godless man.

## The Human Condition, Morality, and the Existence of God
- The text from 'Journal314_11-19' discusses the human condition, morality, and the existence of [[God]], highlighting the contradictions and uncertainties that arise when considering these topics, as expressed through various quotes and philosophical reflections.
- The author describes the human tendency to be sensitive to trivial matters while being indifferent to significant issues, and notes that this inversion is a characteristic of the human condition, using the metaphor of men in chains waiting for their death to illustrate this point.
- The text also explores the idea that the short duration of human life, surrounded by the infinite and eternal, can evoke feelings of fear and astonishment, with the author questioning the reason for their existence and the allocation of their place and time in the world.
- The author critiques philosophers, including [[Plato]], for constructing ethics independently of the question of the mortality or immortality of the soul, and expresses their own doubts and concerns about the existence of a Divinity, feeling trapped in a state of uncertainty.
- The text touches on the idea that the finite is annihilated in the presence of the infinite, and that human justice and spirit are insignificant compared to divine justice, leading to a sense of nihilism and the incomprehensibility of God's existence or non-existence.
- The author references the concept of the "numinous" as described by Otto, characterized as "terrifying" and "incomprehensible", and notes that reason is incapable of deciding whether God exists or not, leaving humans to make a wager in the face of infinite uncertainty.
- Throughout the text, the author, who appears to be influenced by the thoughts of [[Blaise Pascal | Pascal]], grapples with the limitations of human knowledge and the inevitability of forgetting, striving to acknowledge and accept their own nothingness and weakness.

## Scepticism, Weakness, and the Nature of Justice
- The author discusses the concept of scepticism, noting that they will write their thoughts without order, as this disorder is a true reflection of the subject matter, which is incapable of being structured or boxed in, a idea also expressed by Cioran.
- The author is astonished that people are not more aware of their own weaknesses, and instead, they follow their own modes of life as if they knew where reason and justice truly lie, with this ignorance being a natural state of humanity, as also noted in the concept of Maya.
- The author reflects on their own life, realizing that they once believed in the existence of justice, but came to distrust their own judgment and that of others, recognizing that human nature is in a state of continual change, and that this understanding has not changed over time.
- The author references Ecclesiastes, which states that without [[God]], humanity is in a state of total ignorance and misery, and notes that scepticism can actually help religion, a idea also discussed by thinkers such as Tillich, [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], and [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]].
- The author argues that the principles of sceptics, stoics, and atheists are true, but their conclusions are false because the opposite principles are also true, which is in line with Pascal's mistrust of contradictions as a criterion for truth.
- The author highlights the greatness of humanity, which lies in its ability to recognize its own misery, and notes that this awareness of misery is a unique aspect of human experience, as opposed to the experience of other living beings, such as trees.
- The author observes that people are not miserable without feeling it, and that this feeling of misery is a fundamental aspect of the human experience, which is also acknowledged by the fact that people often hide or glory in their miseries.
- The author points out the contradictions in human nature, where people who despise humanity still wish to be admired and believed by others, and notes that this nature is stronger than reason, convincing people of their own greatness despite their baseness.
- The author concludes that humanity is necessarily mad, and that not being mad would be another form of madness, a idea also discussed by thinkers such as Becker, Tillich, and Cioran, and that it is advantageous to show people both their equality with animals and their greatness, rather than leaving them in ignorance of either.

## The Dual Nature of Humanity and the Search for Truth
- The section from the document 'Journal314_11-19' emphasizes the importance of recognizing the dual nature of humanity, acknowledging that man must not consider himself equal to either animals or angels, but rather be aware of both aspects of his nature.
- It criticizes those who either praise or blame humanity, and instead approves of those who seek the truth with a sense of lamentation, as expressed in the quote "I blame equally those who choose to praise man, those who choose to blame him, and those who choose to amuse themselves; and I can only approve of those who seek with lamentation."
- The text highlights the value of experiencing exhaustion and weariness in the search for the true good, which can ultimately lead to seeking redemption, as stated in the phrase "It is good to be tired and wearied by the vain search after the true good, that we may stretch out our arms to the Redeemer."
- The section also explores the relationship between piety and goodness, noting that experience reveals a significant difference between the two, and that true justice and mercy involve humbling pride and combating sloth, as mentioned in the quote "The property of justice is to humble pride, however holy may be our work...and the property of mercy is to combat sloth by exhorting to good works."
- Additionally, the text warns against the dangers of self-satisfaction and the pursuit of earthly pleasures, citing the quote "There is nothing so perilous as what pleases [[God]] and man," and advises that it is better to avoid self-righteousness, as expressed in the phrase "It is better not to fast, and thereby humbled, than to fast and be self-satisfied therewith," which is attributed to [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]] and Francis de Sales.
- The section further discusses the importance of balancing the knowledge of God with the awareness of human misery, as stated in the quote "The knowledge of God without that of man's misery causes pride, and the knowledge of man's misery without that of God causes despair," a concept also noted by Huxley.
- The text also touches on the idea that [[Christianity]] requires a balance between recognizing human vileness and desiring to be like God, in order to avoid vanity or abjectness, as mentioned in the quote "Christianity is strange, it bids man recognize that he is vile, even abominable, and bids him desire to be like God."
- Finally, the section notes that atheism demonstrates a certain level of mental strength, but only up to a point, and that it can lead to naturalism or nihilism if taken to its logical conclusion, as mentioned in the phrase "Atheism shows strength of mind, but only to a certain degree."
