- The text also emphasizes the importance of pure, perfect, and essential love, which consists of self-denial, resignation, humility, poverty of spirit, and a low opinion of oneself, as stated, and many people dedicated to prayer may not truly experience God's presence because they are not mortified or attentive to God after their prayers.

- The exercise of annihilating oneself utterly and giving oneself up to suffer for Christ's sake is the sum and root of all virtue, and without it, all other efforts, including meditations and communications, will be profitless, and Christ teaches that one must detach oneself from all things, desiring nothing, to ascend the narrow path and find great refreshment and sweetness in carrying the cross.

- The text also highlights the difference between the natural man and the Christian, where the natural man shudders at things that are not truly dreadful, while the Christian has a deeper understanding of what is truly dreadful, and that Christianity has discovered an evil that man as such does not know of, which is the sickness unto death.
- Kierkegaard notes that the possibility of this sickness is man's advantage over the beast, and that to be sharply observant of this sickness constitutes the Christian's advantage over the natural man, and that to be healed of this sickness is the Christian's bliss, and that the concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a peculiar sense, where death itself is a transition unto life.
- The text quotes Kierkegaard as saying that "the despair which is the passageway to faith is also by the aid of the eternal: by the aid of the eternal the self has courage to lose itself in order to gain itself", and that "man's life is wasted who lived on, so deceived by the joys of life or by its sorrows that he never became eternally and decisively conscious of himself as spirit, as self, or (what is the same thing) never became aware and in the deepest sense received an impression of the fact that there is a God, and that he, he himself, his self, exists before this God".

- The text touches on the idea that true spirituality requires a sense of solitude and introspection, which is essential for individuals to connect with their true selves and understand their place in the world.
- The author critiques the superficiality of worldly distractions and diversions, suggesting that they can be a form of escapism that prevents individuals from truly confronting their own spirituality and the nature of existence.

- The true sufferer can still work for the Good outwardly by the power of example, and their life contains a great challenge to others, as well as a severe judgment upon those who use their gifts in an inexcusable way, and even if isolated, the sufferer is still sharing in mankind's great common concern and defending a difficult pass by saving their own soul.
