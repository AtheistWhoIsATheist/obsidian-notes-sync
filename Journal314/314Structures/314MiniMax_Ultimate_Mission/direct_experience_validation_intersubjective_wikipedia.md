The provided Wikipedia article on "Intersubjective verifiability" directly addresses the user's query. Here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information:

**Definition and Significance of Intersubjective Verifiability:**

*   **Definition:** Intersubjective verifiability is "the capacity of a concept to be readily and accurately communicated between different individuals ("intersubjectively"), and to be reproduced under varying circumstances for the purposes of verification."
*   **Significance:** It is a "core principle of empirical, scientific investigation." It is a near-universal way of arbitrating truth claims, even in colloquial expressions like "Show me!" or "Seeing is believing". The scientific principle of replication is a more structured form of intersubjective verifiability.

**Application to and Challenges for Mystical or Subjective Experiences:**

*   **Challenge:** The article points out a key challenge: "While specific internal experiences are not intersubjectively verifiable." This means that the core of mystical or subjective experiences, which are inherently internal and personal, do not easily lend themselves to intersubjective verification.
*   **Possible Application (or Bridge):** The article suggests a point of connection, stating "the existence of thematic patterns of internal experience can be intersubjectively verified."
    *   For example, the shared experience of discomfort (hunger) when lacking food can be verified.

**Key Concepts and Related Points:**

*   **Subjective vs. Intersubjective:** The article highlights that each individual has a subjective experience, but by sharing those experiences, individuals can create intersubjective understandings.
*   **Congruence and Incongruence:** The article explains that intersubjective verification involves comparing experiences. If experiences "fit" the descriptions, a sense of congruence occurs. If not, incongruence occurs, leading to the need to clarify language, improve descriptions, or correct inaccurate information.
*   **Science and Religion:** The article explicitly mentions the conflict between intersubjective verification (used in science) and belief based on faith (often found in religion). It notes that attempts have been made to bridge the gap, especially as cutting-edge science (particularly in physics) seems to align with certain mystical experiences.
*   **Examples of attempts to bridge the gap:** The article references philosophical and religious movements that attempt to base belief systems on intersubjective verifiability, citing Anthroposophy and Yoism.
*   **Citations:**

In summary, the Wikipedia article effectively defines intersubjective verifiability and explains its role in science, while also acknowledging the challenges it presents for validating subjective experiences, particularly in the context of mystical experiences. It suggests some ways to address the challenge and discusses attempts to reconcile scientific and religious perspectives.
