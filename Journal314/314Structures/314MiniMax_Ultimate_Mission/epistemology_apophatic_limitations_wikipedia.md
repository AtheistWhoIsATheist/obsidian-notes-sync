**Extraction of Relevant Information:**

The article itself doesn't explicitly list "limitations, criticisms, or problems" as a direct section. However, the nature of apophatic theology inherently lends itself to certain challenges, which are implied throughout the text and can be inferred:

*   **Unknowability and Potential for Misinterpretation:** A central tenet of apophatic theology is the unknowability of God's essence. This focus on negation can lead to misunderstandings or difficulties in conveying the nature of the Divine. It requires careful interpretation to avoid the impression that God is entirely absent or irrelevant to human experience.
*   **Risk of Agnosticism or Atheism:** The emphasis on what God *is not* can be misconstrued, leading to skepticism about God's existence or nature. The article touches on this in the section "Apophatic theology and atheism," discussing the potential for it to be seen as a form of atheism or agnosticism.
*   **Difficulty in Practical Application:** While the article doesn't explicitly mention this, a purely apophatic approach may present challenges for religious practice. If God is beyond all comprehension, how can one meaningfully engage in prayer, worship, or ethical behavior? The article acknowledges that mysticism often accompanies apophatic theology, hinting at the necessity of a different way of knowing.
*   **Reliance on Cataphatic Theology (Via Eminentiae):** The article highlights that many proponents of apophatic theology (e.g., Aquinas) often employ *via eminentiae*, i.e., using positive attributes found in creatures to describe the Divine. The limitations of *via eminentiae* are indirectly relevant; the analogies used may be inadequate or fail to capture the essence of God.
*   **Difficulty in Articulating a Coherent Religious System:** A purely negative approach can make it challenging to develop a complete and consistent theological system. It may lead to a focus on what is *not* rather than what *is*, making it difficult to formulate positive doctrines or provide guidance on religious life.
*   **Potential for Elitism or Obscurantism:** The emphasis on special knowledge can lead to an elitist view of religious understanding, suggesting that only a select few can truly grasp the Divine. This may create a gap between the learned and the common believer.
*   **Challenges in Cross-Cultural Dialogue:** The reliance on negative language can make it difficult to understand and compare religious ideas across different cultures and traditions, especially when attempting to explain an apophatic theology to people with different religious assumptions and practices.

**Note:** The article provides significant historical and philosophical context for apophatic theology, which allows for a deep exploration of the topic.
