Here's a detailed analysis of the provided web content, focusing on the user's query:

**1. Relevance Determination:**

The web content is **highly relevant** to the query. The article is titled "Seeing the Void: Experiencing Emptiness and Awareness with the Headless Way Technique," directly addressing the user's need for information on exercises and phenomenological characteristics related to experiencing emptiness/void from the "Headless Way" perspective. The article is a research paper published in the journal *Mindfulness*.

**2. Detailed Extraction of Relevant Information:**

The article provides several key pieces of information related to the query:

*   **Headless Way Exercises:** The study uses Headless Way exercises developed by Douglas Harding. The article provides descriptions of the exercises, which involve directing attention inwards to the location from which one sees, specifically to the place where the head is not seen. The following exercises are described:
    1.  Looking Down at Body
    2.  Looking at Nose
    3.  Hands Exercise
    4.  Visual Field Exercise
    5.  Pointing Exercise
    6.  Card Exercise
    7.  Closed Eyes Exercise
    8.  Pointing Exercise 2
    9.  The Tube Exercise
*   **Objective:** To assess the reliability of the Headless Way methods in eliciting the recognition of awareness and void-like experiences, to investigate the prevalence of these experiences, and to differentiate these experiences from closely related and potential precursor experiences.
*   **Method:** The study involved 20 adults participating in in-depth individual interviews guided through the Headless Way exercises. A thematic analysis was conducted on the interview transcripts.
*   **Results:**
    *   **Prevalence of Experiences:** Twelve of the participants reported a void-like experience, and five participants reported an experience of awareness itself.
    *   **Categorization of Experiences:** These experiences were categorized as subsets of more general categories: perceptual absences and the sense of not being person-like.
    *   **Real-time Reports:** The article highlights real-time reports of awareness and void-like experiences during the exercises.
*   **Phenomenological Characteristics of Experiences:**
    *   **Perceptual Absences:** Participants reported the inability to see their face, which was coded as a visual absence.
    *   **General Absence/Void-like Experiences:** Participants described experiences of void or emptiness, often during the Pointing Exercises and the Tube Exercise. The descriptions included terms like "emptiness," "nothing," and "not anything." The article notes that the most interesting reports were when emptiness coincided with the location of the observer.
    *   **Awareness Itself/Featureless Observer Experiences:** Some participants described an experience of awareness itself, or being a featureless observer, particularly during the Eyes Closed and Tube Exercises.
    *   **Not-Person-Like Experiences:** Participants reported not experiencing anything that distinguished themselves as human or person-like.
    *   **Depersonalization:** Eight participants described a sense of depersonalization, where the face in the mirror did not seem their own.
*   **Comparisons:** The research paper compares void-like experiences and awareness-itself experiences with those found in contemplative traditions. It differentiates between objectless pure awareness experiences and object-directed pure awareness experiences. The study differentiates between the experience of emptiness in Zen and the one in the study.
*   **Statistical Information:**
    *   **Number of Participants:** Twenty adults participated in the study.
    *   **Meditation Experience:** The participants' self-reported years of regular meditation practice ranged from 0 to 66 years.
    *   **Quantitative Results:** Tables 1 and 2 present the number of participants giving a response (code) by exercise type and the number of text segments for each code by exercise type, respectively.
    *   **Figure 4:** This figure shows the instances of void-like experiences described by participants by their number of years of regular meditation.
*   **Temporal Information:** The article was published on April 17, 2024.
*   **References:** The article cites numerous references related to consciousness, phenomenology, mindfulness, and contemplative practices, including works by Douglas Harding, Robert Forman, and others.
*   **Limitations:** The interviewer's questions could have led to participants' responses. The article also indicates the need for further research.
