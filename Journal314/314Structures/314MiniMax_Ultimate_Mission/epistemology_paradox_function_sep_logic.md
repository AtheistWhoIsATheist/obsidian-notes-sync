The web content is from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and discusses paradoxes in contemporary logic. It is highly relevant to the user's query. Here's a detailed extraction of the information:

**1. Introduction**

*   **Relevance of Paradoxes:** The content emphasizes that paradoxes have gained a new role in contemporary logic. They've led to theorems (often negative results like unprovability), and they are not just confined to theoretical discussions.
*   **Role in Logic's Development:** Several fundamental logical notions have taken their current shape due to attempts to resolve paradoxes.
*   **Examples of Affected Notions:** The text mentions how the notions of *set*, *collection*, *syntactical and semantical concepts of standard classical logic* (logical languages of a given order, the notion of satisfiability, definability) have been shaped by paradoxes.
*   **By-products of Paradoxes:** The study of paradoxes has yielded set theory axiomatizations, a systematic development of type theory, the foundations of semantics, and a theory of formal systems (at least *in nuce*). The *predicative/impredicative* dichotomy also arose from these investigations.

**2. Paradoxes: early developments (1897–1917)**

*   **Focus:** The entry concentrates on the emergence of non-trivial logical themes and notions from the discussion on paradoxes from the beginning of the 20th century until 1945.
*   **Terminological Warning:** The terms "antinomy" and "contradiction" are used interchangeably with "paradox" in this context.
*   **Areas of Early Importance:** The section highlights the importance of paradoxes in the following areas:
    1.  Ordinal and cardinal numbers
    2.  Property, set, class
    3.  Proposition and truth
    4.  Definability and the arithmetical (or atomistic) continuum
*   **Specific Paradoxes and Their Impact:** Several specific paradoxes are examined.
    *   **Burali-Forti Paradox:** This concerns ordinal numbers and showed the problematic nature of the collection of all ordinals.
    *   **Cantor's Paradox:** Deals with cardinal numbers, specifically the notion of "the set of all conceivable sets," which leads to a contradiction because of Cantor's theorem.
    *   **Russell's Contradiction:** (Also see the entry on Russell's paradox) This is a foundational paradox that involves self-reference. The key idea is that a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself leads to a contradiction when applied to itself. It is about classes that do not belong to themselves. This has implications for abstraction operations and the foundations of set theory.
    *   **Russell's Paradox Involving Propositions and Truth:** This paradox highlights issues with propositional functions and leads to the emergence of type theory. The entry details how Russell's paradox applies to predicates, classes, and propositional functions and leads to the development of the doctrine of types. It also discusses the implications of propositions forming a type and the resulting challenges.
    *   **Zermelo's Paradox:** Zermelo independently discovered Russell's paradox, which is stated that a set MM that comprises as elements all of its subsets is inconsistent.
    *   **Hilbert's Contradictions:** Hilbert discovered additional contradictions, which included a functional version of Russell's paradox based on *functional self-application* and *direct self-reference.*
    *   **Difficulties Arising from Definability and the Continuum:** Around 1905, paradoxes highlighted the relationship between *definability* and the structure of the mathematical continuum, and in particular whether the continuum can be well-ordered and whether Cantor’s Continuum Hypothesis (CH) holds. This involves the concept of reals that are definable in finitely many words.

**3. Paradoxes, Predicativism, and the Doctrine of Types: 1905–1913**

*   **Key Figures:** The section details the ideas of Poincaré and Russell on the resolution of paradoxes.
*   **Poincaré's Views:** Poincaré viewed the contradictions as grounds for an intuitionistic, Kantian point of view. He criticized the definition of natural numbers and argued against the logicist definition of natural numbers as those numbers which belong *to all recurrent classes*. The definition is not admissible since it refers essentially to a totality to which the class to be defined belongs—the definition is *impredicative*—and hence it is to be regarded as *circular.* *Mathematical objects do not exist without a proper definition*, and a proper definition must be *predicative*, i.e., it must avoid *vicious circles*. Poincaré held the view that *a predicative classification is characterized by invariance*, i.e., that it cannot be affected by the introduction of new elements; by contrast, impredicative notions are subject to constant modification whenever new elements are introduced.
*   **Russell's Approach:** Russell attacked the *comprehension principle* and proposed the vicious circle principle. Russell accepted *the vicious circle principle*, for which he used a formulation in the terminology and adopting the notions of formal logic as formulated by Peano: *Whatever comprises an apparent variable should not be one among the possible values of that variable.* Russell developed his own technical devices—such as the ‘substitution method’ (Landini 1998), and the contextual elimination of definite descriptions – in order to implement his ideas.
*   **Liar Paradox and Berry's Paradox:** Russell analyzed the Liar paradox by assuming a true proposition. The paradox is solved by construing the Liar as ‘there is a proposition that I state and that is false’; hence the statement contains *a quantification (hence an apparent variable) over the collection of all propositions*, and it is not a proposition in a proper sense. The Berry paradox, is also explained here.
*   **Theory of Types:** The doctrine of types is based upon the observation that universal quantification—understood as full generality, i.e., when xx ranges ‘over the whole universe’—does not make sense. Each variable must have a preassigned type.
    *   **Ramified Hierarchy:** The entry describes the hierarchy of types and orders in Russell's ramified theory. It involves individuals, first-order propositions, second-order propositions, and so on. It also includes the concept of the *order of a function.*
    *   **Axiom of Reducibility:** The *axiom of reducibility* (AR) states that *every propositional function is equivalent, for all its values, to a predicative function of the same variables.*

**4. Logical Developments and Paradoxes Until 1930**

*   **Focus:** This section covers the investigation of logical calculi and axiomatic formal analysis.
*   **Set Theory and Paradoxes:** This part discusses circular objects and ordinary vs. extraordinary sets. The section includes Mirimanoff's work on circular sets and the generalization of the Burali-Forti antinomy (the paradox of grounded sets). It also discusses von Neumann's system and its handling of the Burali-Forti antinomy. The application of graph theory for representing circular structures by Finsler is presented.
*   **Type-Theoretic Developments:** Hilbert's work and the development of the *Hilbert-Ackermann textbook of 1928** are covered here. Chwistek’s nominalistic approach to resolving Richard’s classical antinomy is discussed. Ramsey's distinction between *logical and epistemological contradictions* is explained and the solutions of the semantical antinomies (e.g., the Liar, Berry’s) through meaning are presented.

**5. Paradoxes: Between Metamathematics and Type-Free Foundations (1930–1945)**

*   **Context:** This section describes the reshaping of paradoxical arguments into fixed-point results by the work of Gödel and Tarski.
*   **Diagonalization:** It explains the role of the *diagonalization lemma* in transforming semantic paradoxes into indefinability and undecidability results.
*   **Foundations of Semantics:** This section covers Tarski's analysis of semantic paradoxes.
    *   **Tarski's Solution:** Tarski's structural definition of basic semantical notions, his concept of satisfaction, and his proof of the adequacy condition (T) are presented. Tarski's semantics makes precise Gödel’s remark that “the true reason of the incompleteness is that the formation of ever higher types can be continued into the transfinite[…], while in any formal system at most denumerably many of them are available”. Tarskian semantical notions play the role of the higher types hinted at by Gödel.
*   **The Inconsistency of Certain Formal Logics:** This section discusses how paradoxical constructions became essential tools for defining objects and proving non-trivial logical mathematical facts.
    *   **Combinatory Logic:** Curry's work, the combinators, and the analysis of the source of the paradoxes are shown here.
    *   **Curry's Paradox:** Curry's paradox is presented in detail.
*   **Criticizing Standard Implication and Negation:** This part explains how a remedy would be to formulate within the system the very notion of proposition, and a way to avoid the contradictions would lead to a hierarchy of canonical propositions. Fitch's approach consists of *the construction of suitable syntactical models, endowed with self-referential notions of class, membership and truth.* Bochvar's proposal based on the introduction of a three-valued logic is described.
*   **Non-terminating Processes, Cycles and Typical Ambiguity:** Behmann's work is described. Also, the discussion about Lewis and Langford (1932) is also presented. This section touches upon Quine's paper of 1937 on the system NF.

**6. A Glance at Present-Day Investigations**

*   **From Paradoxes to Theorems:** The text highlights that the right question to deal with is not how *to get rid of paradoxes* or to solve them: instead, the *fruitful* problem is *to get something out of them*. For instance, paradoxes can be converted into plain undecidability/undefinability theorems.
*   **Foundational Frameworks and Paradoxes:** It provides a picture of the Neo-Fregean approach, especially from the Neo-Fregean approach based on Hume’s principle and variations thereof and the consistent subsystems of Frege’s Grundgesetze. This section presents how consistent subsystems of Frege’s Grundgesetze have been isolated and are currently studied. Additionally, this section mentions how some of the foundational frameworks have been affected by antinomies.
*   **Circularity and Self-Reference:** This section presents the study of universes of set theory where circular sets exist. Non-well-founded sets and their applications in several fields such as natural languages, theoretical computer science and the analysis of the paradoxes are presented here. This section refers to the semantical paradox of Yablo.
*   **From Paradoxes to Incompleteness:** This section focuses on Löb’s theorem, Curry’s paradox, and the use of Berry’s paradox. It also touches upon the Kolmogorov complexity and *algorithmic information theory* and the works of Chaitin. Additionally, the studies of epistemic notions are presented here.
*   **On the Foundations of Semantics, Again:** The section gives an overview of the approaches that have generalized or modified Tarski's semantical conception of truth since 1975, including Kripke's fixed point methods, Gupta-Belnap revision theories, and revision-theoretic definitions and theories of circular definitions. It also presents Field's solutions of the semantical paradoxes and the indexical solutions of the Liar.
*   **Staying Non-Classical:** The content covers the approaches based on paraconsistent and substructural logics. The discussion about infinite-valued logic is also present.
*   **Towards a “geometric” approach:** The application of graph theory for grasping the patterns of paradox and their structural features is presented here.
