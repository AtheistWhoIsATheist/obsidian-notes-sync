*   **Meister Eckhart's Apophatic Tendencies & Language:**

    *   The entry explains that Eckhart's work embodies a kind of *speculative mystagogy*—an edificatory spiritual itinerary grounded in a complex philosophical cosmology and anthropology, fused to a sophisticated Trinitarian doctrine of God, and culminating in (without aiming at!) the intellectual realization of the unity of the Divine and human natures.
    *   Eckhart's approach to language, interpretation, and communication is a guiding thread. Much of his work revolves around the ways in which words, especially understood as “signs” or “images”, can both reveal and obscure. This tension is played out in a dynamic, distinctly Eckhartian dialectic that moves back and forth between saying and “unsaying”, univocity and equivocity, speech and silence—between the limits of finite human language and the self-communication of the Divine Intellect in the “Eternal Word” (i.e., Christ).
    *   Despite his strong apophatic tendencies, the speculative aspect of Eckhart’s mystagogy might best be characterized as a *philosophy of the Word*, according to which the second person of the Christian Trinity (understood as the divine *logos* or scholastic *ratio*) represents the metaphysical threshold between the human and the divine, as well as the medium by which the timeless, singular Godhead (the “One” of Neoplatonist philosophy) is “translated”—linguistically, epistemically, and even ontologically—into the discursivity and multiplicity characteristic of the grammar, thought, and very existence of creatures.
    *   Eckhart's hermeneutical approach is to blur the boundaries between theology and philosophy. Reason and natural philosophy can *also* be used to illuminate the truths and “hidden meanings” revealed in Scripture.
    *   Eckhart's so-called “parabolic” method takes a dehistoricized and decontextualized approach to Scripture, in which a passage is dissected into individual words, phrases, or sentences, which are then given particular philosophical, theological, or metaphorical glosses and sometimes recombined with other similarly interpreted biblical passages in what McGinn calls “a dense web of intertextuality”. It also provides multiple, not necessarily commensurate interpretations, so that “the reader can freely take now one and now the other as seems useful to him” (*In Ioh.* n.39; LW III:33; EE 135).
    *   From an epistemic standpoint, Eckhart may have seen this polyphonic hermeneutical method as providing a way for finite and limited humans to mirror the infinite and all-encompassing divine perspective—namely, by using a kind of deliberate *multi-perspectivity* to achieve a more comprehensive and objective “God’s-eye view”, one which (in the human case) discursively subsumes all things under the unified aspect of the divine *logos*, allowing the human mind to reflect, albeit imperfectly, the timeless, or eternally present, *nû/nunc* of the divine Intellect (McGinn 2005: 112).

*   **Godhead as Nothingness:**

    *   Eckhart speaks of God as a “desert”, an “abyss”, a “wasteland” or “wilderness”, or simply “the divine nothing”.
    *   This identification of God with utter non-being, as opposed to total fullness of being, rests on Eckhart’s approach to *intellectus* more generally. In human beings, for example, the intellect, as a natural power of the soul, is a capacity to take on the representations or “cognitive forms” (*species*) of the objects that it cognizes and, ultimately, to become in some sense identical with them. However, when considered apart from its objects, the created intellect is, strictly speaking, *nothing*.
    *   In fact, it is the “nothingness” of the human intellect in its sheer potentiality and indeterminateness that Eckhart sees as most closely mirroring the divine intellect.
    *   The human intellect is largely *receptive*, its potentiality actualized by the already-existing objects in the world that it passively receives. The nothingness of the divine intellect, in contrast, is essentially *productive*. It “reaches out” to those things that are not and, in cognizing them, simultaneously causes them to be.
    *   On Eckhart’s view, the divine intellect “pre-conceives” both being itself and the entirety of knowable forms within it, and in God’s knowing them (as their *ratio*), they come to exist. Considered merely as essences or forms that have their principle in the divine mind, they are said to be pre-contained “intellectually” like a house in the mind of an architect, which has no being until the architect herself “trans-forms” the idea into a real building. However, in the divine intellect they are neither individually distinct nor determinate, but are rather contained as a unity.
    *   Consequently, when we view ourselves as genuinely existing beings, we are considering the human being in the mode of creaturely existence, and this appropriately retains the gulf between the divine-*qua*-creator and the human being-*qua*-created. However, when we view ourselves as “nothing” in comparison to the absolute being of the divine, we locate in that nothingness the very mode in which human beings are made *ad imaginem Dei*—namely, insofar as they possess that very same mode of non-being, i.e., *intellect*. In this way, Eckhart’s “metaphysics of analogy” attempts to preserve intuitions concerning both God’s utter transcendence and the real presence of God in creation.
    *   When Eckhart discusses *unum* with respect to God, he notes that “the term ‘one’ is a negative word but is in reality affirmative.” Moreover, it is the negation of negation which is the purest form of affirmation and the fullness of the term affirmed. The divine unity “negates” everything that we know “is”; but the negation of all that is […] opens up vistas into a new world in which our distinctions between what is and what is not no longer pertain. God as *negatio negationis* is simultaneously total emptiness and supreme fullness.

*   **Relation to Mystical Understanding:**

    *   Eckhart’s mystagogical and moral approach is centered around the concept of the “birth of the Word” in the human soul.
    *   The entry explains that Eckhart is not referring to the traditional notion of intellect understood as one of the three main “powers” of the soul (i.e., memory, intellect, and will) when speaking of the intellect insofar as it images God or “births” the Word in the soul. He means the intellect *insofar as it is intellect*—which, as we saw above, he takes to be pure negativity or “no-thing-ness”. This is not the human intellect insofar as it apprehends or “takes in” the environment around it via the senses, nor even insofar as it reasons abstractly or performs certain cognitive operations to extract intelligibles from its sensory input. Rather, it is nothing but *pure potentiality*—a wholly receptive *intellectus possibilis*.
    *   The soul’s ground is characterized as an uncreated, eternal aspect of the soul, one related univocally, not analogically, to its Creator (Connolly 2014: 162; Kern 2013: 246). Insofar as it images the Godhead in being wholly one and simple (“neither this nor that”), but a “something” higher than any particular thing or created power—it transcends memory, reason, will, and even contingent being itself. It even lies beyond the purview of God understood as Father, Son, or Holy Spirit.
    *   Eckhart claims that the human being as an intellective *imago dei* is like a *bîwort* or *adverbium*—i.e., a “secondary word” that accompanies a princip(i)al Word to form a single unit of meaning.
    *   The claim that God is forced to do anything with respect to the human being, let alone enter into their soul, may appear quite radical at first glance, but when we recall that the ground of the soul is the univocal point of connection to the divine, and that this connection is, for Eckhart, fundamentally *intellectual*, we may think of the Meister’s necessity claim less as making a causal assertion (e.g., “the emptied soul *causes* God to enter the soul”) and more as expressing a fundamental truth to be discovered by the subject.
    *   For Eckhart, our task as human beings is to come to be able to *listen* to—and thereby *apprehend*—the Word that is eternally and always poured out into in us.
