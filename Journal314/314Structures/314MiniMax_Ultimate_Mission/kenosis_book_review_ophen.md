The web content provides a review of Adam Y. Wells' book, "The Manifest and the Revealed: A Phenomenology of Kenōsis," focusing on the phenomenology of kenosis. Here's a detailed extraction of the information related to the query:

**Summary of the Book's Content and Argument (as presented in the review):**

*   **Central Argument:** The book explores the analogy between the phenomenological method of reduction and the kenosis hymn in Philippians 2:5-11. Wells proposes a "kenotic reduction" to establish a phenomenology of Scripture.
*   **Kenotic Reduction:** Wells argues that the kenosis hymn operates as a type of phenomenological reduction, potentially more radical than Husserl's. This reduction involves "bracketing" the world (cosmos) as the primary source of truth and value.
*   **Goal:** To create an "absolute science of Scripture" where phenomenology and Scripture mutually clarify each other. This approach aims to ground contemporary Biblical criticism, avoiding dogmatic presuppositions.
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Absolute Science:** A presuppositionless science able to ground all positive sciences. Phenomenology, in this context, becomes an absolute science by investigating its own constituting activity.
    *   **Transcendental Subjectivity:** The field opened up by the reduction; the proper subject matter of absolute science, as the source of all objectivity.
    *   **Kenōsis:** Not merely an emptying of divine status, but the "emptying" of the cosmos as the ground of truth, leading to a "new creation" sustained by God's love.
*   **Structure of the Book (as described in the review):**
    *   First half: Explores the radicalization of phenomenology, tracking its development from Husserl to Fink and Steinbock to formulate the concept of "absolute science".
    *   Second half: Applies the kenotic reduction to Scripture, particularly the kenosis hymn.
*   **The reviewer's (Nikolaas Deketelaere's) Criticism:**
    *   The reviewer questions the uncritical adoption of Fink's view of reduction and the related emphasis on un-humanized transcendental subjectivity.
    *   Concerns about the theological implications of identifying transcendental cognition with divine cognition.
    *   The reviewer also questions how the kenotic reduction in Wells' absolute science of Scripture might function as a basis for a universal experience of the scripture, questioning if it loses its credibility in the world.

**Key Points Regarding Kenosis and Incarnational Aspects (from the review):**

*   **Kenosis and Incarnation:** The review highlights that Wells' interpretation of kenosis does not focus on Christ's divinity emptying itself to become human in the incarnation, but instead focuses on the human emptying itself of its humanity, as it were, to reach transcendental consciousness.
*   **The Role of "Cosmos":** The "kenotic reduction" is described as a reduction "from cosmos to 'new creation'" (107). The "cosmos" is bracketed, revealing the world as a "new creation," renewed by God's love and power.
