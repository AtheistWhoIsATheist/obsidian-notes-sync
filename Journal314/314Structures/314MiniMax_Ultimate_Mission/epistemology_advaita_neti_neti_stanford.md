  "relevance": "The provided text is highly relevant to the query. It is an entry from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Śaṅkara, which extensively discusses Advaita Vedānta and its epistemological framework.",
  "extracted_information": {
    "epistemological_function_neti_neti": {
      "overview": "The method of *neti neti* (not this, not this) is a key element in Śaṅkara's Advaita Vedānta for understanding the ultimate reality, Brahman. It is a form of negative language used to negate properties, conceptions, limitations, and identities that are falsely attributed to Brahman.",
      "function": "The primary function is to strip away all qualifications and limitations imposed on the concept of Brahman and the self (*ātman*). This is achieved by negating all finite attributes and conceptualizations, to reveal Brahman's true nature as undifferentiated, unobjectifiable, and nondual.",
      "process": [
        "Negation targets the discontinuity aspect by stripping away all qualifications to personal identity and the external world.",
        "It removes false superimpositions of body, senses, and mind previously attributed to Brahman.",
        "It denies any nameability of Brahman, its grammatical object.",
        "Negative language attempts to avoid defining absolute reality as a thing in the world.",
        "It denies any nameability of Brahman, its grammatical object.",
        "Negative language usually constitutes half of a paradox that affirms positive and negative propositions at the same time."
      ],
      "relation_to_brahman": "Neti neti is directly tied to Brahman's unobjectifiable status. It emphasizes the inability of predicates to apply to absolute reality. By negating all that is not Brahman, it aims to reveal Brahman's nature as pure, formless, and beyond conceptual grasp.",
      "role_in_understanding_ultimate_reality": "By systematically negating all finite and limiting aspects of reality, *neti neti* leads to the direct recognition of the ultimate reality as pure consciousness, which is numerically identical to Brahman. It is used to cut through false conceptions, including one’s tendency to grasp after the absolute, without lapsing into nihilism or an infinite regression.",
      "comparison_to_other_methods": "Negative assertions of *neti neti*, which follow or imply a positive assertion, parallel the other two methods. *Lakṣaṇā* and *anvaya*-*vyatireka* similarly depend on negation through mutual restriction, while simultaneously indicating the intrinsic nature of Brahman without falling into nihilism.",
      "key_concepts": [
        "Brahman: The ultimate reality, the ground of all existence.",
        "*Ātman*: The self.",
        "Superimposition: The false identification of the self with the mind-body.",
        "Avidyā: Ignorance, the root cause of suffering.",

    "other_relevant_information": {
      "śankara_overview": "Śaṅkara (c. 8th century CE) was a key figure in Advaita Vedānta, a school of Indian philosophy emphasizing nondualism. His works are centered on systematic theories of metaphysics, language, and epistemology, and he incorporated methods of philosophical teaching.",
      "two_orders_of_reality": "Śaṅkara posits two orders of reality: the empirical world (vyāvahārikasattā) and the ultimate reality (pāramārthikasattā) of Brahman. The empirical world is considered a provisional ontology, while ultimate reality is the final ontology.",
      "metaphysics": "Key metaphysical concepts include: Brahman as the nondual ground of all things, the world as less-than-real, and the role of *māyā* (illusion/appearance).",
      "consciousness": "Witnessing consciousness (*sākṣin*) is the foundation of subjective experience. Self-illuminating consciousness is numerically identical with nondual existence, which is Brahman. The reflection theory (*pratibimba*) addresses how individuals superimpose false identities on consciousness.",
      "contemplative_methods": "The method involves: discriminating the transient from the eternal, developing dispassion towards worldly objects, practicing control of the mind and senses, and having a desire for liberation. The triple process involves *anvaya* and *vyatireka*, secondary indication (*lakṣaṇā*), and negative language (*neti neti*)."
