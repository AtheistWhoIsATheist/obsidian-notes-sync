**Sufi Concepts: *Fana* (Annihilation) and *Baqa* (Subsistence)**

*   **Introduction:** The article discusses *fana* and *baqa* as key concepts in Sufism, focusing on their etymology, literal meanings, and experiential aspects.

*   ***Fana* (Annihilation):**
    *   **Etymology and Literal Meaning:**
        *   Arabic: *fanāʔ* (فَنَاء) means annihilation, evanescence, extinction, and perishment.
        *   Possible connection to Aramaic *pānyā* (פניא‎ / ܦܢܝܐ‎), meaning end-time, evening, or decisive point.
        *   Ottoman Turkish: *fenâ* (فناء) as a noun (vanity, perishment, nothingness) and adjective (vain, idle, bad, evil).
        *   Modern Turkish: *fena* (bad, evil, sick).
        *   Arabic root: *f-n-y* (ف ن ي‎)
        *   Related Arabic words: *fānin* (evanescent, transitory), *faniya* (to perish), and *ʔafnā* (to destroy, annihilate).
        *   Maltese: *fena* (to exhaust).
    *   **Interpretations:**
        *   **Interpretation 1:** *Fana* is the "death before the death," complete annihilation of the ego and self, representing true self-control and restraint from desire.
        *   **Interpretation 2:** *Fana* as the annihilation of the self and ego in front of Allah Ta’ala, recognizing oneself as only an instrument in the Divine Plan.
        *   **Interpretation 3:** (Unionist approach, considered heretical by some): *Fana* is the breakdown of the individual ego and the realization of a fundamental unity between Allah, creation, and the individual self.
    *   **Quranic Basis:**
        *   *Surah Ar-Rahman, Verse 26-27:* "All things in creation suffer annihilation and there remains the face of the Lord in its majesty and bounty."
        *   Also references Quran 3:185 which states "every *nafs* that exists will suffer death"
    *   **Further concepts regarding Fana:**
        *   **The passing away of the attributes of the lower self (nafs) and the passing away of the repugnance to, and reliance upon, anything that may happen.**
        *   *Kashf al-Mahjub by Al-Hujwiri:* Annihilation of all remembrance of other' and subsistence (baqa) means ‘subsistence of the remembrance of God’ (baqa al-dhikhr al-haqq).
        *   This involves abandonment of one’s individual self and replacing it solely with the contemplation of Allah and recognizing His Will
        *   This combines with the knowledge of certainty (*ilm al-yaqin*), leading to the vision of certainty (*ayn al-yaqin*), and then to **Ma’rifa** (gnosis; immediate realization of the reality of things). From here one can finally reach the reality of certainty (*haqq al-yaqin*). This stage is what Al-Ghazali called *fana’ kulli* and *fana fi al-tawhid*. It is the recognition of Allah as the sole agent of the universe.
        *   *Kitab al-Luma fi al-Tassawuf:* Mystics of Baghdad have erred in their doctrine that when they passed away from their qualities they enter into the qualities of God. This involves incarnation or leads to the Christian belief concerneing Jesus. The doctrine in question has been attributed to some of the ancients, but its true meaning is that when a man goes forth from his own qualities and enters into the qualities of God, he goes forth from his own will, which is a gift to him from God, and enters into the will of God, knowing that his will is given to him by God and by virtue of this gift he is served from regarding himself and becomes entirely devoted to God and this is one of the stages of the unitarians. Those who have erred this doctrine have failed to observe that the qualities of God are not God. To make identical with his qualities is to be guilty of infidelity, because God does not descend into the soul, but that which descends into the soul is faith in God and belief in his unity (tawhid) and reverence for the thought of him.
        *   **Masnvai by Rumi:** When the Shaykh (Halláj) said ‘I am God’ and carried it through (to the end), he throttled (vanquished) all the blind (sceptics). When a man’s ‘I’ is negated (and eliminated) from existence, then what remains? Consider, O denier.

*   ***Baqa* (Subsistence):**
    *   **Etymology and Literal Meaning:**
        *   Arabic: *baqāʔ* (بَقَاء) means remaining, lasting, enduring, perpetual existence, duration, survival, and continuance.
        *   Root: *b-q-y* (ب ق ي‎)
        *   Related words: *baqiya* (to last, to endure), *biʔi* (to stay, to remain).
        *   Ottoman Turkish and Persian: *beka* (بقا‎) and *baqā* (بقا) mean the same.
        *   Malay: *baka* (eternal), derived from Arabic.
        *   Turkish: *beka* (survival, lasting, remaining).
    *   **Sufi Concept:**
        *   Described as the state of living "with Allah, through Allah, in Allah, and for Allah."
        *   *Baqa* is what comes after *fana*.
        *   It is the second step, the great *manzil* or destination.
        *   *Maqāmāt, manāzil, maydān, and aḥwāl* of the human being
        *   In *Baqa* one prepares for constantly remembering and living for Allah.
        *   It is the Divine Eternity.
        *   *Baqa* is the state achieved in this life, a version of the final worship, and is permanent and never-ending.
        *   The highest stage where self-awareness is retained and one is constantly aware of the Divine.
