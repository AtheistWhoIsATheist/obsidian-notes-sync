**Relevance:**

The web content is highly relevant. The page is a Wikipedia article titled "Śūnyatā," and the entire article is dedicated to explaining this concept. It comprehensively covers the definition, etymology, development across various Buddhist schools, its relationship to related concepts, and philosophical implications.

**Detailed Information Extraction:**

*   **Definition:** Śūnyatā (Sanskrit) and Suññatā (Pali) are translated as "emptiness," "voidness," "vacuity," "openness," "thusness," and sometimes "nothingness." It's a fundamental concept in Buddhist philosophy.
*   **Etymology:** Śūnyatā is the noun form of the adjective *śūnya* (empty, void, zero, nothing) with the suffix *-tā* (denoting a quality or state of being, similar to "-ness").
*   **Development of the Concept:** The article traces the concept's roots to *anatta* (non-self) in early Buddhism. It then details its evolution through various schools:
    *   **Early Buddhism:**
        *   Pāli Nikāyas: *Suññatā* is used as a meditative dwelling, an attribute of objects, and a type of awareness-release. Examples include the *Pheṇapiṇḍūpama Sutta* (SN 22:95) where aggregates are described as empty. Also, the *Suñña Sutta* describes the world as empty of self or anything pertaining to self. Meditative state through Arūpajhānas
        *   Chinese Āgamas: Parallels to the *Pheṇapiṇḍūpama Sutta* are present. Āgamas also link emptiness to dependent origination.
    *   **Early Buddhist Schools and Abhidharma:** Many schools considered *śūnyatā* important.
    *   **Theravāda:** Emptiness is the not-self nature of the five aggregates. The *Patisambhidamagga* describes the aggregates as empty of essence (*sabhava*). *Visuddhimagga* discusses how not-self becomes apparent. Buddhadasa equated *nibbana* with emptiness and also the "innermost heart" of the Buddhist teachings.
    *   **Mahayana Buddhism:**
        *   Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras: Teach that all entities are empty of *svabhava*. The Heart Sutra (a later Prajñāpāramitā text) directly states that the five skandhas, the five senses, the mind, and the four noble truths are empty.
        *   Mādhyamaka school: Founded by Nāgārjuna, it focuses on the analysis of emptiness and the non-substantiality of all things. The *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* (MMK) is a key text. Equates emptiness of dharmas with dependent origination.
        *   Yogācāra school: Explains emptiness through the three natures theory. Emptiness is the absence of duality between subject and object.
        *   Buddha-nature: Focuses on the *Tathāgatagarbha* (Buddha-nature), which is present in all beings. The ultimate goal is characterized using a range of positive language.
        *   Tibetan Buddhism: Emptiness is mainly interpreted through Mādhyamaka. Discusses autonomist (*svātantrika*) and consequentialist (*prāsaṅgika*) approaches and the views of Dolpopa (*shentong*). Also discusses *rangtong*.
        *   Chinese Buddhism: Introduced in terms of indigenous Chinese philosophical culture. *Sānlùn* school of Kumārajīva. Zhiyi's Tiantai school. The Huayan school using the concept of Indra's net. The Chan school presentation of emptiness.
        *   Western Buddhism: Notes *Śūnyatā* as the emptiness of inherent existence and the emptiness of mind.
*   **Relation to Other Concepts:**
    *   Anattā (non-self): Emptiness is related to the understanding of non-self in early Buddhism.
    *   Pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination): Emptiness is equated with dependent origination in Mādhyamaka, implying that all phenomena arise from causes and conditions and lack inherent existence.
    *   Svabhāva (intrinsic existence): Emptiness means all things are devoid of *svabhava*.
*   **Philosophical Implications:**
    *   Not Nihilism: The article explicitly states that *śūnyatā* is not nihilism, but a positive or foundational concept. In Mādhyamaka, the realization of emptiness is seen as crucial for liberation.
    *   Two Truths Doctrine: Nāgārjuna's two-truth schema: phenomenal world and the highest reality (*paramarthasatya*).
*   **Alternative Translations:** Emptiness, voidness, vacuity, openness, thusness, and nothingness.
