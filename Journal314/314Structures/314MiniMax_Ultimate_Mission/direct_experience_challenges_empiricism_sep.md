The web content provides a detailed analysis of the dispute between rationalism and empiricism, with specific focus on the historical context, key theses, and arguments involved.

Here's a breakdown of the information relevant to the user's query:

**1. The Dispute and its Core:**

*   The central dispute between rationalism and empiricism concerns the *sources of knowledge* and the extent to which experience is essential for gaining knowledge of the external world.
*   It addresses questions about the nature of knowledge (particularly propositional knowledge), how knowledge is acquired, and the limits of knowledge.
*   It highlights the distinction between sense experience and reflective experience, though notes this distinction is often blurred in the debate.

**2. Key Theses and Arguments:**

*   **Intuition/Deduction Thesis:**
    *   Claims that some propositions can be known through intuition alone, and others through deduction from intuited propositions. Intuition is defined as direct, immediate insight.
    *   This thesis applies across different subject areas (mathematics, ethics, metaphysics, etc.).
    *   Rationalists often employ this to argue for the certainty of knowledge.
    *   Empiricists accept this thesis, but often restrict its applicability to the relations of ideas, not to substantive knowledge of the external world.
*   **Innate Knowledge Thesis:**
    *   Asserts that we are born with knowledge of certain truths. This knowledge does not depend on experience for its justification.
    *   Examples include Plato's theory of recollection and Chomsky's theory of innate language acquisition capacities.
    *   Empiricists (Locke) reject this, arguing that experience is the source of all knowledge.
    *   Rationalists (Leibniz, Carruthers) respond to Locke's critique, using the concept of "natural potential" or innate dispositions to explain innate knowledge in light of evolutionary selection.
    *   Challenges for the innate knowledge thesis include providing a compelling definition of innateness that distinguishes it from non-innate knowledge, and how warranted beliefs can be formed without relying on experience or deduction.
*   **Innate Concept Thesis:**
    *   States that we have some concepts that are not derived from experience but are part of our rational nature. Experience acts to "trigger" these concepts.
    *   Descartes argues for innate concepts, particularly the concept of God.
    *   Empiricists (Locke) argue against this, claiming that experience can explain all ideas.
    *   Rationalists (Leibniz) respond, asserting that the mind has its own role in shaping content, and emphasizing that what we have innately are only the abilities and the architecture needed to run the software, in the case of Locke.
    *   Challenges to this thesis involve explaining how the concept formation can be made without assuming that there exists innately the concept. Hume's focus on the limited contents of our concepts, determined by experience, becomes the main focus of this debate.

**3. Challenges to Empiricism and the Role of Subjective/Mystical Claims:**

*   The content specifically does *not* discuss or address the challenges empiricism faces in accounting for knowledge *not directly derived from sensory experience, which could relate to validating subjective/mystical claims.* This is not part of the content, as well as the limitations of the article.

**4. The Debate's Implications:**

*   The debate has implications for the nature of metaphysics and ethics.
*   The rationalist/empiricist distinction has historical implications for how philosophy has been classified (e.g., the Early Modern period).

**In Summary:**

The web content offers a comprehensive overview of the core tenets of the rationalist/empiricist debate, including the arguments and counter-arguments related to the sources of knowledge. While it provides a good understanding of the debate regarding the role of experience in knowledge, particularly regarding the acquisition of knowledge and concepts related to the external world, it does not delve into the challenges empiricism faces in validating subjective or mystical claims, which is a notable omission.
