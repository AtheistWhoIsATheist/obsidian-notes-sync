Here's a breakdown of the information related to your query, extracted from the provided web content:

**Overview:**

The article "The Stages of Samadhi According to the Ashtanga Yoga Tradition" delves into the stages of *samadhi* (higher consciousness) within the framework of Ashtanga Yoga, based on Patanjali's *Yoga Sutras*. It aims to clarify the nature of these stages and how they relate to meditation experiences, *pratyaksha* (direct experience), *pramana* (right knowledge), and the overall journey toward liberation (*kaivalya*).

**Key Points and Data Extraction:**

1.  **Ashtanga Yoga and the *Yoga Sutra*:**

    *   The *Yoga Sutra* is described as a detailed map of higher consciousness, primarily focusing on the mind's transformation through various stages of *samadhi*.
    *   Ashtanga Yoga is one of the two systems mentioned in the *Yoga Sutra*, the other being *kriya yoga*. Ashtanga yoga systematizes and explains yoga practice, clarifying both the goal and the path.

2.  **Stages of Samadhi (Samprajñata Samadhi)**

    *   Patanjali defines two broad categories of samadhi: *samprajñata samadhi* (samadhi with higher knowledge) and *asamprajñata samadhi* (beyond higher knowledge).
    *   The content primarily focuses on *samprajñata samadhi*, which Patanjali describes as having four stages in sutra 1:17: *vitarka* (reasoning), *vichara* (reflection), *sananda* (ecstasy), and *sasmita* (a sense of ‘I’-ness).
    *   The text further divides *vitarka* into *savitarka* and *nirvitarka*, and *vichara* into *savichara* and *nirvichara*, resulting in six stages.
    *   The stages of samprajñata samadhi are impermanent.
    *   Each stage yields directly experienced "knowledge" and some degree of non-attachment.

3.  **Preparing the Mind:**

    *   The text emphasizes that all prior limbs of Ashtanga yoga contribute to the attainment of samadhi.
    *   Key steps include *pratyahara* (withdrawal of attention from externals) and *dharana* (concentration).
    *   *Dharana* leads to *dhyana* (meditation), and *dhyana* in time develops into samadhi.

4.  **Detailed Explanation of Stages within Samprajñata Samadhi:**

    *   **Savitarka Samadhi**:
        *   Involves "thought transformation on an object with the help of words".
        *   The mind is "glued" to the object, and the ordinary mental functions continue, but identification deepens.
        *   Words, *shabda*, are used as a support for concentrating on and obtaining knowledge about the object.
        *   Knowledge involves distinguishing the real from the unreal.
        *   Three components: *artha* (physical form), *shabda* (sound or name), and *jñana* (personal or cultural information).
        *   Repeated experiences prepare the mind for *nirvitarka samadhi*.
    *   **Nirvitarka Samadhi**:
        *   The mental alternations of *shabda*, *artha*, and *jñana* are suspended.
        *   The mind is absorbed in *artha*, or form, and loses awareness of being the knower.
        *   The mind becomes immersed in *artha* alone, which is the image of the physical form and also the feeling, function, and essence of it.
        *   Acts as a bridge between the physical and subtle universes.
        *   Provides *pratyaksha* (direct experience), a means of *pramana* (right knowledge).
    *   **Savichara Samadhi**:
        *   The mind explores the subtle aspects of the object.
        *   The mind experiences and explores the subtler level of the object through an alternation of awareness between its spatial, temporal, and causal aspects.
        *   Words used to describe the experience in these samadhis come later, when the yogi recollects the experience.
    *   **Nirvichara Samadhi**:
        *   *Sattva guna* is active. *Tamas guna* is suppressed.
        *   True one-pointed concentration, the *sattvic state of ekagara chitta*, becomes possible.
        *   Perceptual limitations of time and space are transcended.
    *   **Sananda Samadhi**:
        *   Experiences bliss or ecstasy.
        *   The only thought is the awareness of pleasure.
    *   **Sasmita Samadhi**:
        *   The yogi can directly perceive the source of *ahankara* (ego-sense), *mahat* (cosmic mind), and the *asmita vritti*, the pure "I-sense."
        *   The individual ego merges into the cosmic ego.
        *   The feeling is one of deep and pure peace, free from thoughts and individuality.
        *   The object of meditation becomes the luminous reflection of the Divine Self.
        *   *Siddhis* (special abilities) may become active.

5.  **The Ultimate Goal:**

    *   The stages of samprajñata samadhi are way stations but not the final goal.
    *   The potential is to attain the stage leading to *asamprajñata samadhi*, and finally to *kaivalya* (complete union).
