Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Key Concepts and Definitions:**

*   **Zen Kōans:** Short, often paradoxical statements or questions used in Zen Buddhism, primarily in the Soto tradition, to foster contemplation.
*   **Purpose of Kōans:** To encourage contemplation, help practitioners live with ambiguity and paradox, and facilitate the letting go of binary thinking.
*   **Relationship to Emptiness:** Kōans are seen as tools to lead towards a state of emptiness where one can perceive the self as merely an idea.

**How Kōans Work (Based on the Content):**

*   **Break the Thinking Mind:** Kōans are designed to challenge the logical mind and encourage a different way of thinking.
*   **Foster Contemplation:** Monks spend extended periods pondering these unsolvable puzzles.
*   **Embrace Ambiguity:** They encourage acceptance of questions without answers.
*   **Self-Discovery:** Kōans guide students toward self-discovery.

**Perspectives from Zen Masters and Authors:**

*   **Don Dianda:** Views kōans as surgical tools to break through the mind and reach the inner regions beyond knowing.
*   **Philip Kapleau:** Highlights that meditating on a kōan can lead to despair and that the role of the kōan is not to lead us to satori (enlightenment), but, on the contrary, to make us lose our way and drive us to despair.
*   **Alan Watts:** States kōans are meant to guide the student toward self-discovery, a direct encounter with the world, independent of convention.

**Examples of Popular Zen Kōans:**

*   "When both hands are clapped a sound is produced; listen to the sound of one hand clapping (1)."
*   "Out of nowhere, the mind comes forth (2)."
*   "Two monks are arguing about a flag. One says, “The flag is moving.” The other, “The wind is moving.” A third walks by and says, “Not the wind, not the flag; the mind is moving (3)."
