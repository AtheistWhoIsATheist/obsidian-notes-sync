The content is centered on Nagarjuna's philosophy, its foundations, and explanations of the key concepts of Śūnyatā and dependent origination. The website is about Buddhism and addresses the user's query.

**Detailed Data Extraction:**

Here's a breakdown of the information related to the user's query, as extracted from the provided content:

*   **Nagarjuna and Śūnyatā:**
    *   Nagarjuna is considered a "second Buddha" and the founder of the Madhyamika (Middle Way) school, also known as Sunyavada ("doctrine of emptiness").
    *   The content discusses Nagarjuna's view of emptiness (*sunyata*) and dependent origination (*pratityasamutpada*), which is presented as a crucial doctrine.
    *   The concept of emptiness is presented as a central idea in Nagarjuna's philosophy. It's equated with dependent origination.
*   **Śūnyatā and *Svabhava* (Own-Being):**
    *   Nagarjuna's inquiry began with the Buddhist definition of emptiness as the absence of *svabhava*.
    *   *Svabhava* is discussed in detail. The content differentiates between essence-*svabhava* (unchanging essence), substance-*svabhava* (inherent existence), and absolute *svabhava*.
        *   Essence-*svabhava* is a property that an object cannot lose without ceasing to be that very thing. It's a specific, characterizing property and has a cognitive function to distinguish objects.
        *   Substance-*svabhava* is something that doesn't depend on anything else.
        *   Absolute *svabhava* is the true or final nature of things.
    *   The text explains how Nagarjuna shifted the meaning of *svabhava* from "unchanging essence" to "inherent substance."
    *   The content emphasizes that things do not exist as they appear in ordinary consciousness, as independent substances.
*   **Dependent Origination (*pratityasamutpada*):**
    *   Nagarjuna equated emptiness with dependent origination.
    *   All things, including emptiness itself, arise co-dependently.
    *   This concept rejects the interpretation of emptiness as "nothing exists at all" and the interpretation of emptiness as an Ultimate Reality or Absolute.
*   **Method of Deconstructing Concepts:**
    *   The content explains that Nagarjuna's philosophy is about understanding that things lack *svabhava*. This involves seeing things as dependent on our minds and therefore, not existing objectively outside our minds.
    *   The need to practice and train oneself to avoid projecting *svabhava* is discussed.

**Missing Information (but still relevant):**

*   While the content extensively covers *Śūnyatā* and its relationship to Nagarjuna's philosophy, it doesn't directly address the *Catuṣkoṭi* (tetralemma) as a specific method of deconstructing concepts. However, the discussion of *Śūnyatā* and the denial of inherent existence provides the philosophical groundwork that relates to this method.
