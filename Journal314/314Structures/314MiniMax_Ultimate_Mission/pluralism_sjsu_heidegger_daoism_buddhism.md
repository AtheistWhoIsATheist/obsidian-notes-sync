**Information Extraction:**

Here's a breakdown of the main points presented in the abstract, extracted and organized:

*   **Central Question:** The abstract explores different conceptions of nothingness, asking if philosophers are discussing the same concept and, if not, how they differ. It investigates the possibility of distinct types of nothing.

    1.  **Privative nothing:**  Described as absence.
    2.  **Negative nothing:**  Defined as the "altogether not" or absolute nothing.
    3.  **Original nothing:**  Equated with being.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** The author intends to test this typology by comparing the concepts of nothing in:
    *   **Heidegger:**  Referring to his concept of "Nichts" (nothing).
    *   **Daoism:**  Referring to "wu 無" (nothing).
    *   **Buddhism:**  Referring to "sunyata" (emptiness).
*   **Expected Outcome:** The analysis aims to clarify confusion surrounding the understanding of nothingness in these three traditions and to shed light on the philosophical question of "what there is not."
