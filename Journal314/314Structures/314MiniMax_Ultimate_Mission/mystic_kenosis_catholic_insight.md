*   ***Christology:*** The study of the nature of Christ.

**Self-Gift, Self-Empting, and Sacrifice:**

*   The article connects *kenosis* with *self-giving* love and *sacrifice.*
*   It states that we are to empty ourselves in imitation of Christ, giving ourselves in love, because we are created in the image and likeness of God whose Trinitarian life is self-surrender and love.
*   The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass is presented as a re-presentation of this *kenosis*, where both the divinity and humanity of Christ are veiled.
*   Participating in the Eucharist is participating in this Mystery of God’s self-giving and self-emptying love, and becoming devout and Eucharistic is a reflection of the goodness of God.
*   The article emphasizes that an authentic Christian life is a sacrificial life, a life of conformity to Christ Crucified.

**Humility:**

*   The article highlights that humility is a critical aspect of understanding the *kenosis*, as the hymn describes Christ humbling Himself.
*   Approaching the Mystery of the Eucharist with humility and devotion is emphasized.

**References and Examples:**

*   **Philippians 2:6-11:** A key biblical text cited in the article which describes Christ's self-emptying. (*Christ Jesus…emptied himself… He humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death – death on a cross*)
*   **Romans 12:1:** *"I appeal to you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship"*
*   **Romans 12:2:** *"Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that you may prove what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect"*
*   **St. Pius of Pietrelcina (Padre Pio):** Used as an example of someone who, through suffering, was conformed to the Mystery of Our Lord's Sacrifice. Pope Paul VI's quote about Padre Pio is also included: *"Look at what fame he had, what a worldwide following gathered around him! But why? Perhaps because he was a philosopher? Because he was wise? Because he had resources at his disposal? It was because he said Mass humbly, heard confessions from dawn to dusk and was – it is not easy to say it – one who bore the wounds of our Lord. He was a man of prayer and of suffering."*
*   **Pope Benedict XVI:** Quote, *"Each one of us is the result of a thought of God. Each of us is willed, each of us is loved, each of us is necessary."*
*   **Galatians 2:20:** *"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."*
