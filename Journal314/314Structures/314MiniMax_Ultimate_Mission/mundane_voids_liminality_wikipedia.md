Here's a breakdown of the information extracted from the provided Wikipedia article, focusing on the definitions and key concepts of liminality, especially as they relate to Arnold van Gennep and Victor Turner:

**1. Definitions and Key Concepts of Liminality:**

*   **Definition:** Liminality, derived from the Latin word "limen" (threshold), is the quality of ambiguity, disorientation, or transition that occurs in the middle stage of a rite of passage. It's the "in-between" phase where individuals are neither in their pre-ritual status nor the new status they will hold after the rite.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Ambiguity and Disorientation:** A sense of being "betwixt and between," a state of uncertainty and flux.
    *   **Transitional State:** Occurs during the middle stage of a rite of passage or a period of significant change.
    *   **Threshold:** Participants are on the threshold of a new state or identity.
    *   **Potential for Change:**  Liminality can lead to the dissolution of social hierarchies, questioning of traditions, and the establishment of new customs and institutions.

**2. Arnold van Gennep's Contribution:**

*   **Coined the term "liminality."**
*   **Rites of Passage:**  Van Gennep's primary focus was on rites of passage in small-scale societies.
*   **Three-Fold Structure of Rites of Passage:**
    *   ***Preliminal rites (or rites of separation):*** The initiate separates from their old status or way of life. Symbolically, it's like a "death" of the old self.
    *   ***Liminal rites (or transition rites):*** The crucial "in-between" phase.  These rites often involve prescribed sequences and are overseen by a master of ceremonies.  The initiate is "on the threshold" of a new identity.
    *   ***Postliminal rites (or rites of incorporation):*** The initiate is re-integrated into society with their new status. It's a "rebirth" and acceptance of the new identity.
*   **Four Categories of Social Rites of Passage (according to Van Gennep):**
    1.  Passage of people from one status to another (e.g., initiation ceremonies, marriage).
    2.  Passage from one place to another (e.g., moving houses).
    3.  Passage from one situation to another (e.g., starting university).
    4.  Passage of time (e.g., New Year celebrations, birthdays).
*   **Universality of the Pattern:** Van Gennep argued that this three-part structure is present in ritual passages across all cultures.

**3. Victor Turner's Contribution:**

*   **"Re-discovered the importance of liminality" and expanded its application beyond small-scale societies.**
*   **Expanded the concept of liminality:** Turner applied the concept beyond purely ritual contexts. He saw its relevance to understanding human reactions to liminal experiences, personality development, and the interplay of thought and experience.
*   **Attributes of Liminality:** Turner emphasized that liminal states involve ambiguity and a dissolution of identity, leading to disorientation. But, this can also allow for new perspectives and the scrutiny of cultural values.
*   **Communitas:**  Turner introduced the concept of "communitas," the sense of shared experience and camaraderie within a group undergoing a liminal experience.
    *   **Spontaneous Communitas:**  Direct and immediate sharing of identities.
    *   **Ideological Communitas:**  Attempting to achieve spontaneous communitas, often through interventions aiming for a utopian society.
    *   **Normative Communitas:** Efforts to sustain and integrate the feelings of community into the social structure.

**4. Liminality Theory Today:**

*   The term has broadened to include political and cultural change.
*   Application to a variety of subjects, including individuals, groups, societies.

**5.  Types of Liminal Experiences (as summarized in the chart):**

The article presents a chart summarizing the different dimensions and subjects of liminal experiences, and also provides the main characteristics and key examples of each category.

|  | Individual | Group | Society |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Moment | * Sudden events affecting one's life (marriage, death, divorce, illness, retirement); * Individualized ritual passage (baptism, ritual passage to adulthood, as for example among the Ndembu). | * Ritual passage to adulthood (almost always in cohort groups); graduation ceremonies, etc. | * A whole society facing a sudden event (sudden invasion, natural disaster, a plague) where social distinctions and normal hierarchy disappear; * Carnivals; * Revolutions. |
| Period | * Critical life-stages; * Puberty or teenage years; * Pregnancy; * Menopause. | * Ritual passage to adulthood, which may extend into weeks or months in some societies; * Group travels; * Going to university, college or taking a gap year between secondary school and college/university. | * Wars; * Revolutionary periods. |
| Epoch (or life-span duration) | * Individuals standing "outside society", by choice or designated (as with exiled persons); * Monkhood; * In some tribal societies, individuals remain "dangerous" or excluded because of a failed ritual passage; * Twins are permanently liminal in some societies.[*citation needed*] | * Religious fraternities, ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities; * Immigrant groups betwixt and between; * Old and new cultures; * Groups that live at the edge of "normal structures", may be perceived as dangerous (e.g., punks) and/or "holy" (e.g, monks living by strict vows). | * Prolonged wars, enduring political instability, prolonged intellectual confusion; Incorporation and reproduction of liminality into "structures"; * Modernity as "permanent liminality". |

**6.  Liminoid Experiences (as defined by Turner):**

*   **Definition:**  Experiences that share some characteristics of liminality but are optional and do not involve a resolution of a personal crisis. They are more common in modern, industrialized societies.
*   **Key Difference:** Unlike liminal experiences, liminoid experiences do not result in a change of status, but are more about transitional moments.
*   **Examples:** Sports, concerts, commercial flight.

The article provides comprehensive definitions, key concepts, and the contributions of Arnold van Gennep and Victor Turner to the understanding of liminality. It also describes the different types of liminal experiences and how this relates to modern culture.
