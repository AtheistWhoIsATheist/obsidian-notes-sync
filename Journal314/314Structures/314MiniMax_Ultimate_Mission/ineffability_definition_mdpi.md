    "summary": "The article, 'Embracing the Unknowable: Paradigm of Ineffability' explores the concept of ineffability within the philosophy of religion and mysticism, focusing especially on apophatic conceptions of the divine. It aims to construct a 'paradigm of ineffability,' treating ineffability as a central, defining feature of mystical experience and a key component in understanding the divine. The author examines three key meanings of 'Being Ineffable': ineffability as a definition, as a mystical experience, and as the Ineffable (God/Absolute).  The article engages with arguments for and against ineffability, particularly addressing the 'problem of coherence,' and critiques contextualist challenges to the uniqueness of mystical experiences. The author also explores the Doctrine of Divine Simplicity, Creatio ex Nihilo, and negative theology as they relate to ineffability, ultimately positioning ineffability as a foundational element in understanding the divine and the nature of mystical experience.  The article concludes with the argument that by embracing the unknowable we can see what is before us in the light of the darkness behind us, and that ineffability is not a negation, but an affirmation."
