Here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information:

**2. The Early Wittgenstein**

This section introduces the early Wittgenstein, primarily focusing on his *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*.

**2.1 *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus***

*   **Overview:** The *Tractatus* is presented as a work addressing the central problems of philosophy concerning the world, thought, and language, offering a solution grounded in logic and representation.
*   **Structure:** The book's structure is described as having seven basic propositions (1-7) with further elaborations using decimal expansions.

    *   **Propositions (Ogden Translation):**
        *   1: The world is everything that is the case.
        *   2: What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.
        *   3: The logical picture of the facts is the thought.
        *   4: The thought is the significant proposition.
        *   5: Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions.
        *   6: The general form of truth-function is \[¯p,¯ξ,N(¯ξ)][p¯,ξ¯,N(ξ¯)]. This is the general form of proposition.
        *   7: Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
    *   **Propositions (Pears/McGuinness Translation):**
        *   1: The world is all that is the case.
        *   2: What is the case—a fact—is the existence of states of affairs.
        *   3: A logical picture of facts is a thought.
        *   4: A thought is a proposition with sense.
        *   5: A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions.
        *   6: The general form of a truth-function is \[¯p,¯ξ,N(¯ξ)][p¯,ξ¯,N(ξ¯)]. This is the general form of a proposition.
        *   7: What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.
*   **World, Thought, and Language:** The *Tractatus* posits that the world, thought, and language share the same logical form, enabling thought and propositions to be pictures of facts.
*   **Facts and Objects:** The world consists of facts (1), which are existent states of affairs (2), which are combinations of objects. Objects are simple and combine according to their logical, internal properties (their logical form).
*   **Pictures and Representation:** Thoughts and propositions are pictures (2.12). Each element in the picture represents an object, and the combination of elements represents the combination of objects in a state of affairs. The logical structure of the picture is isomorphic with the state of affairs. The pictorial form enables the picture to picture something but also limits what it can picture (its own form).
*   **Sense and Meaning:** Wittgenstein identifies two conditions for sensical language: the structure of the proposition must conform to logical form, and the elements of the proposition must have reference (*Bedeutung*). Logical analysis culminates in a name being a primitive symbol for a simple object. Logic provides the structure and limits of what can be said.
*   **General Form of a Proposition:** "The general form of a proposition is: This is how things stand" (4.5). Every proposition is either true or false. Complex propositions are composed from atomic ones using truth-functional operators (5).
*   **Truth-Functions and Logical Operations:** Wittgenstein presents Frege's logic with truth tables. Every statement about complexes can be analyzed into its constituent parts (2.0201). The general form of a truth-function (6) [¯p,¯ξ,N(¯ξ)][p¯,ξ¯,N(ξ¯)] uses one formal operation (N(¯ξ))(N(ξ¯))and one propositional variable (¯p)(p¯) to claim that any proposition is the result of logical operations on elementary propositions.
*   **Equal Value of Propositions:** All meaningful propositions are of equal value.
*   **Limits of Language:** Wittgenstein ends the book with an admonition concerning what can and cannot be said, leaving out ethics, aesthetics, and metaphysics.

**2.2 Sense and Nonsense**

*   **Purpose:** The *Tractatus* aims to distinguish between sense and nonsense, to find the limits of world, thought, and language (Preface).
*   **Conditions for Sense:** A proposition has sense if it can represent or picture facts. Names must have *bedeutung*, but only in the context of a proposition with logical form.
*   **Senseless Propositions:** These include the propositions of logic, tautologies, and contradictions. They are "senseless" (*sinnlos*).
*   **Nonsensical Propositions:** These are more radically devoid of meaning. Includes "Socrates is identical," "1 is a number," and "there are objects." Traditional metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics are excluded.
*   **Saying and Showing:** What cannot be said (formulated in sensical propositions) can only be shown. This applies to logical form, pictorial form, and the unsayable (metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic) – "things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical" (6.522).

**2.3 The Nature of Philosophy**

*   **Philosophy's Role:** Philosophy is not a theory or doctrine but an activity. It's an activity of clarification and critique of language. The philosopher should react to traditional philosophers' musings, showing them where they go wrong using logical analysis, i.e., that some of their propositions are nonsense.
*   **Value of Propositions and Limits:** All propositions are of equal value (6.4) as measured by logic and the notion of limits. The *Tractatus* uses logical-philosophical notions that don't belong to the world.
*   **The Ladder Metaphor:** The *Tractatus* is like a ladder to be used to understand the world rightly, but then recognized as nonsense and discarded (7).

**2.4 Interpretative Problems**

*   **Key Interpretative Issues:**
    *   The realism of the *Tractatus* (independent existence of objects, states of affairs, and facts).
    *   The role of nonsense and its relation to the *Tractatus* itself.
    *   The *Tractatus* as an ethical tract.
*   **Realism vs. Anti-Realism:** Does the *Tractatus* prioritize language or does it posit an independent reality? The "linguistic turn" is recognized by all, but the bi-polarity of propositions and the picturing relation supports a realist interpretation.
*   **Nonsense and the Mystical:** Recent readings of the *Tractatus* take nonsense seriously as precisely that. This entails recognizing the ladder metaphor (6.54) and the distinction between saying and showing. The *Tractatus* should lead away from such temptations.
*   **Ethical Reading:** The ethical position arises from the emphasis on silence and the importance given to the ineffable. This includes "the importance given to the ineffable."
*   **Continuity:** Debate surrounds the continuity between the early and later Wittgenstein. Some interpret the early and later Wittgenstein as distinctly separate, while more recent scholarship suggests a more continuous view of Wittgenstein’s work.
