The web content is highly relevant. It is an entry from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy dedicated to the topic of "Intuition." The entry is current, with a substantive revision date of August 23, 2024. It contains detailed information on the nature, epistemological role, and challenges associated with intuition in philosophical inquiry. It also touches upon the connection between intuition and experimental philosophy.

Here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information:

**1. The Nature of Intuitions:**

*   **Definition:** The entry focuses on intuitions as mental states or events in which a proposition *seems true*. It distinguishes this from broader uses of the term in everyday language.
*   **Intuitions as Beliefs:**
    *   Some philosophers equate intuitions with beliefs.
    *   **[A1]:** *S* has the intuition that *p* if and only if *S* believes that *p*.
    *   However, the entry notes that belief that *p* is neither necessary nor sufficient for intuition that *p*, citing paradoxes and optical illusions as examples.
    *   **[A2]:** *S* has the intuition that *p* if and only if *S* forms the occurrent belief that *p* without consciously inferring it from some other belief. This is a more discriminating version, treating intuitions as beliefs with a suitable etiology.
    *   **[A3]:** *S* has the intuition that *p* if and only if *S* forms the occurrent belief that *p* solely on the basis of competence with the concepts involved in *p*. This analysis avoids some of the objections to [A1] and [A2].
*   **Intuitions as Dispositions to Believe:**
    *   **[A4]:** *S* has the intuition that *p* if and only if *S* is disposed to believe *p*.
    *   **[A5]:** *S* has the intuition that *p* if and only if *S* is disposed to believe *p* merely on the basis of understanding *p*. This account places constraints on the source of the disposition.
    *   The entry argues that dispositional accounts fail to capture the occurrent conscious character of intuitions.
*   ***Sui Generis* States:**
    *   This family of accounts holds that an intuition is a *sui generis* occurrent propositional attitude.
    *   **[A6]:** *S* has the intuition that *p* if and only if it seems to *S* that *p*. This account, while fitting for psychological work, is insufficiently discriminating.
    *   **[A7]:** *S* has the intuition that *p* if and only if it intellectually seems to *S* that *p*.
    *   **[A8]:** *S* has the *rational intuition* that *p* if and only if it intellectually seems to *S* that necessarily *p*.
    *   **[A9]:** *S* has the *rational intuition* that *p* if and only if either (1) it intellectually seems to *S* that *p* and (2) if *S* were to consider whether *p* is necessarily true, it would intellectually seem to *S* that necessarily *p*, or it intellectually seems to *S* that necessarily *p*.
    *   These views deny that belief that *p* is necessary or sufficient for an intuition that *p* and reject dispositional analyses of intuition.

*   **Propositions, Properties, and Faculties:**
    *   The entry assumes intuitions take propositions as their objects.
    *   It briefly mentions the idea of *de re* or objectual intuitions of properties or states of affairs.
    *   It notes that the conception of propositional contents may have to be varied with the account of intuition.
    *   It cautions against taking the term "faculty of intuition" to mean more than just the process which produces intuitions.

**2. The Epistemological Role of Intuitions:**

*   **Philosophical and Non-Philosophical Uses of Intuitions:** The entry focuses on the role of intuitions in philosophy.
*   **The Method of Cases:**
    *   **Definition:** A core methodology in philosophy. It is a process where a philosophical theory is taken to be *prima facie* undermined by contradicting an intuition regarding a particular hypothetical case. Conversely, the fact that a theory implies results which agree with intuitions is commonly taken to constitute *prima facie* support for the theory.
    *   **Examples of Cases**
        *   The Gettier Case
        *   The Transplant Case
        *   The Chinese Nation Case
        *   The Flagpole Case
    *   The entry contrasts this with scientific methodology, where empirical observation is the primary evidential basis.
*   **General Intuitions:**
    *   The entry identifies rationalism as a philosophical position that holds that belief in some propositions is not justified by sense experience, introspection, or memory, but rather by *rational intuition.*
    *   Examples include:
        *   Principles of logic
        *   Basic arithmetic
        *   Transitivity claims.
    *   The entry provides examples of general propositions which have been alleged to be intuitive (G1-G7).
*   **Intuitions as Evidence: Intuit*eds* vs. Intuit*ings***
    *   The entry clarifies the ambiguity of saying that an intuition is treated as evidence. Is it the fact that a person has an intuition (the *intuit*ing*) or the propositional content of the intuition (the *intuit*ed*) that is taken as evidence?
    *   The entry suggests that both are treated as evidence.
    *   The occurrence of an *intuit*ing* provides *prima facie* justification for believing the *intuit*ed*.
    *   The *intuit*ed* is a potential basis for the inferential justification of further propositions.
    *   Critics argue that philosophical practice does not treat having an intuition as *prima facie* justification.
    *   The entry defends the view that, with respect to many core questions of philosophy, our justification for believing an answer consists (at least substantially) in our having suitable intuitions.

**3. Challenges and Defenses:**

*   **Four Constraints on Skeptical Challenges:**
    1.  The argument must conclude that intuitions don't justify belief (normative premise).
    2.  The argument must state that beliefs based on intuitions don't satisfy the necessary condition of justified belief (non-normative premise).
    3.  The argument must not equally apply to other sources of justified belief (local skepticism constraint).
    4.  The justification for the premises must come from a source other than the intuitions being challenged, and it must be unlikely that belief in the premises fails the necessary condition on justified belief (non-self-undermining constraint).
*   **The Argument from Lack of Independent Calibration:**
    *   **[P1]:** One is justified in believing the contents of a putative source of evidence only if one has independent justification for the belief that the putative source is reliable.
    *   **[P2]:** We lack independent justification for the belief that intuitions are reliable.
    *   **[C]:** We are not justified in believing the contents of intuitions.
    *   The entry argues [P1] runs afoul of the local skepticism constraint and that the primary reason is the lack of overlap between the contents of intuitions and those beliefs justified by suitably independent sources.
*   **Arguments from Unreliability:**
    *   **The Argument from Unreliability—First Version:**
        *   **[P1]:** One is justified in believing on the (sole) basis of a putative source of evidence only if it is reliable.
        *   **[P2]:** Intuitions (or intuitions of type *T*) are not reliable.
        *   **[C]:** Beliefs based (solely) on intuitions (or intuitions of type *T*) are not justified.
        *   The entry notes the normative premise, is open to the "new evil demon" counterexample.
    *   **The Argument from Unreliability—Second Version:**
        *   **[P1\*]:** One is justified in believing on the (sole) basis of a putative source of evidence only if one lacks (undefeated) reason to think it unreliable.
        *   **[P2\*]:** We have (undefeated) reasons to think intuitions (or intuitions of type *T*) unreliable.
        *   **[C]:** Hence, beliefs based (solely) on intuitions (or intuitions of type *T*) are not justified.
        *   The entry focuses on intrapersonal/interpersonal inconsistencies.
        *   The entry discusses the limits of disagreement as grounds for skepticism, the distinction between intuition disagreement and belief disagreement, and the need for very widespread disagreement to justify skepticism.
*   **Arguments from Explanation:**
    *   These arguments claim: (a) the best explanation of the occurrence of intuitions (intuit*ings*) does not appeal to the truth of their contents (the intuit*eds*), or (b) we cannot explain *how* our intuitions are or could be reliable.
    *   **The Argument from Lack of Explanatory Necessity:**
        *   **[P1]:** Aside from propositions describing the occurrence of her introspectively accessible states, *S* is justified in believing only those propositions which are part of the best explanation of the occurrence of those introspectively accessible states.
        *   **[P2]:** Moral propositions are not part of the best explanation of the occurrence of *S*’s introspectively accessible states.
        *   **[C]:** *S* is not justified in believing moral propositions.
        *   The entry notes that the premises are perfectly general.
    *   **The Argument from Inexplicability of Reliability:**
        *   **[P1]:** If we have good reason to think that there is no explanation of why our intuitions are reliable, then we are not justified in believing *p* on the basis of the intuition that *p*.
        *   **[P2]:** We have good reason to think that there is no explanation of why our intuitions are reliable.
        *   **[C]:** We are not justified in believing *p* on the basis of the intuition that *p*.
        *   The entry suggests that if the reliability of intuitions is a necessary accompaniment of having a certain content, then we have no reason to think our reliability is *inexplicable*.
*   **Defenses of Intuitions: Self-Support and Epistemic Circularity:**
    *   An empirical defense of intuitions would involve providing an inductive argument, based on non-intuitive evidence, that the contents of intuitions are reliable.
    *   Intuition is *self-supporting*, as the general claim that intuitions provide *prima facie* justification for belief in their contents is itself intuitive.
    *   The obvious concern about this sort of defense is that it necessarily involves epistemic circularity of some kind.
    *   If epistemic circularity is *always* unacceptable, then it is impossible to defend the appeal to intuition, as well as perception, memory, and introspection.
    *   The entry discusses perceptual dogmatism, intuitive dogmatism, and general dogmatism and their unavoidable circularity.

**4. Experimental Philosophy and Intuitions:**

*   **The Nature of Experimental Philosophy:**
    *   **The Psychology Project:** Investigates how people ordinarily think.
    *   **The Verification Project:** Determines if propositions philosophers allege to be intuitive are intuitive to non-philosophers.
    *   **The Sources Project:** Discovers the psychological mechanisms or processes that produce people’s intuitions.
    *   **The Variation Project:** Determines the extent of variation in intuitions between different groups, persons or persons-at-times or persons-in-contexts.
*   **The Experimental Evidence:**
    *   Experimental philosophers use surveys, reaction-time studies, empirical evidence from neuroscience, etc.
    *   The entry raises worries about the adequacy of survey methods, including the possibility of different interpretations of cases, multiple concepts, and the influence of pragmatic factors.
    *   The entry discusses the issue of reproducibility.
*   **Experimental Philosophy and Skeptical Challenges:**
    *   The sources project can be used to motivate instances of the Argument from Unreliability and the Argument from Lack of Explanatory Necessity.
    *   The variation project is used to motivate a version of the Argument from Intrasource Inconsistency.

**5. Further Research:**

*   Precise conditions under which epistemic circularity is problematic.
*   The exact actual and possible extent of intuitive disagreement and the proper response to such disagreement.
*   The exact import of self-defeat.
