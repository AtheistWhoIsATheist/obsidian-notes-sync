The provided web content is the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on "Phenomenology."

Based on the user's query, the content is *partially* relevant. It contains a significant amount of information about phenomenology, including its history, methods, and key concepts. However, the specific focus on "phenomenological approaches to Nothingness (e.g., Sartre) and how phenomenology as a philosophical method might address or analyze mystical experiences of the Void or Nothingness" is not directly addressed.

Here's the breakdown:

*   **Relevance:** The article broadly introduces phenomenology and relevant figures like Sartre. It discusses intentionality, consciousness, and experience, which are central to understanding the user's query.
*   **Missing Information:** The article does not specifically discuss phenomenological approaches to "Nothingness" or the "Void." It also doesn't directly address mystical experiences. While Sartre's work is mentioned, the context doesn't explicitly focus on his views on Nothingness. The article provides a basic overview and introductory information on phenomenology.

**Detailed Extraction (Limited by Content):**

I can extract some relevant information that *could* be helpful to the user, but it won't fully answer the question:

*   **Definition of Phenomenology:** The article defines phenomenology as the study of structures of consciousness as experienced from the first-person point of view. The central structure of an experience is its intentionality, its being directed toward something, as it is an experience of or about some object. Phenomenology studies conscious experience as experienced from the subjective or first-person point of view.
*   **Key Figures:** The historical movement of phenomenology is the philosophical tradition launched in the first half of the 20th century by Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul Sartre, *et al*.
*   **Sartre:** The article mentions Sartre's work in the context of existentialism and his book *Being and Nothingness*, but the article doesn't explore his specific views on the topic.
*   **Methods of Phenomenology:** The article mentions the practice of phenomenology, the method of description, interpretation, and analysis of experiences to extract the basic form of intentionality.
*   **Central Themes:** Intentionality, consciousness, and experience are central themes of Phenomenology.

**Failure Explanation:**

The content doesn't address the specific question about phenomenological approaches to "Nothingness" or how phenomenology can be applied to "mystical experiences of the Void or Nothingness." Therefore, the content only provides an overview and not the specific details requested.
