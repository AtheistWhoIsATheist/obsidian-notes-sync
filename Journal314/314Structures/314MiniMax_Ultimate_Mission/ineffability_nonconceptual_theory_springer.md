**Title:** Mystical ineffability: a nonconceptual theory

**Author:** Sebastian Gäb

**Published:** 21 February 2024

**Abstract:**

This paper discusses the nonconceptual theory of mystical ineffability which claims that mystical experiences can’t be expressed linguistically because they can’t be conceptualized. The author discusses and refutes two objections against it: (a) that unconceptualized experiences are impossible, and (b) that the theory is ad hoc because it provides no reason for why mystical experiences should be unconceptualizable. The author argues against (a) that distinguishing different meanings of ‘object of experience’ leaves open the possibility of non-empty but objectless nonconceptual experiences. The author shows that (b) is a valid objection but can be countered by a new theory of mystical non-conceptuality: mystical experiences are not conceptual because the specific mode of mystical consciousness prevents conceptualization. The dissolution of the subjectivity of consciousness during mystical experiences undermines the very foundation of the possibility of conceptual thought and thus renders them ineffable.

**Key Concepts and Arguments:**

*   **Nonconceptual Theory of Mystical Ineffability:** The core argument is that mystical experiences are ineffable (cannot be expressed linguistically) because they are nonconceptual (lacking conceptual content).
*   **Two Objections and Responses:** The article addresses two main objections to this theory:
    *   **Objection (a):** Unconceptualized experiences are impossible. The author refutes this by distinguishing different meanings of 'object of experience', thereby allowing for non-empty, but objectless nonconceptual experiences.
    *   **Objection (b):** The theory is ad hoc (lacking a specific reason for why mystical experiences should be unconceptualizable). The author acknowledges this as a valid objection and counters it by developing a refined version of the nonconceptual theory.
*   **Revised Theory: Mode of Consciousness:** The author's main argument is that mystical experiences are necessarily nonconceptual because the *mode* of mystical consciousness prevents conceptualization. It is not the content of the experience, but the specific way the experience is had, that makes it ineffable.
*   **Dissolution of Subjectivity:** The crucial element of the author's argument is that mystical experiences involve a dissolution of the subject-object structure of consciousness. The "no-subject theory" claims that the mystic experiences a conscious state where the subject (the "I") disappears.
*   **Conceptualization and Subject-Object Structure:** The author argues that conceptualization relies on the subject-object structure of consciousness. Because the very nature of mystical experiences undermines the requirements for conceptual thought, they are ineffable.
*   **Key components of the nonconceptual theory of mystical ineffability (as stated in the paper):**
    1.  Only conceptual content can be expressed linguistically. (I-1)
    2.  Mystical experiences have no conceptual content. (I-2)

**Arguments Against Constructivist Objection:**

*   **Constructivist View:** The constructivist argues that all experiences are interpreted through concepts; therefore, a nonconceptual experience is impossible.
*   **Two Claims of the Constructivist Objection:**
    1.  To interpret an experience is to conceptualize it. (C-1)
    2.  Uninterpreted experiences are impossible. (C-2)
*   **Refutation of Constructivist Objection (C-2):** The author argues that the distinction between two kinds of objects of experience, object1 and object2, leaves open the possibility of objectless experiences (object2-less experiences, that is). Object1 refers to the nonconceptual object. Object2 refers to conceptualized content.

**Ad-hoc-objection & Generality Constraint:**

*   The author considers the question of why mystical experiences should be unconceptualizable, thus addressing the ad-hoc-objection.
*   The author explains how the Generality Constraint governs the possibility of conceptual thought.
*   The author argues that the explanation of Stace, that mystical experiences are unitive, cannot solve the problem.
*   The author makes the point that the apparently ineradicable ineffability of mystical experiences points towards the conclusion that it is necessarily impossible for the mystic to express their experiences.

**Detailed Argumentation of Ineffability and Subjectivity:**

*   **Mode of Experience:** The author emphasizes that the nonconceptual character of mystical ineffability must be explained through the *mode* (the specific conscious act) of experience, not its *content*.
*   **Mystical Experiences as Altered Consciousness:** The author suggests that mystical experiences should be thought of as states of altered consciousness. The specific structure of this type of conscious state should make it understandable why mystical experiences are ineffable.
*   **No-Subject Theory:** Crucially, mystical experience is a state of consciousness without a subject.
*   **Argument Against Subjectless Consciousness:** (1) All conscious states are intentional. (2) All intentional states have a subject. (3) Therefore: there are no conscious states without subject.
*   **Response to the Argument:** The author denies the validity of (2) by stating that mystical experiences actually are subjectless conscious states.
*   **Justification of (4):** If the phenomenal subject dissolves, the phenomenal object will vanish, too. Therefore, subjectless states will also be objectless.
*   **Justification of (5):** Conceptualization is an essential part of constituting an object2 of consciousness. If mystical experiences are objectless, then there is nothing to conceptualize.
*   **The main argument that explains why mystical experiences are ineffable:**
    *   Mystical experiences are states of subjectless consciousness.
    *   If mystical experiences are states of subjectless consciousness, then the sense of unity can be explained as the phenomenological result of entering a state of consciousness in which the phenomenal subject dissolves.
    *   Mystical experiences are untranslatable into our normal mode of consciousness because their different phenomenological structures are incommensurable.
*   **Key point to the explanation of the ineffability of mystical experiences:**
    *   Conceptualization is only possible for objects of consciousness, but mystical experiences are subjectless states.
    *   No objects mean nothing to conceptualize, which in turn means nothing to express.
    *   Mystical experiences are *transcendentally* nonconceptual: the phenomenological character of mystical experiences undermines the conditions for the very possibility of conceptualization.
