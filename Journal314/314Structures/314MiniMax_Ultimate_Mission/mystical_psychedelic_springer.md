        "description": "The essay provides an interpretation of psychedelic peak experiences, criticizing naturalistic attempts to explain them. It offers an alternative ontology, defending an entheogenic view beyond psychological effects. It interprets existential anxiety in terms of Heidegger's ontology and suggests it as a core dimension of spiritual transformation. The phenomenology of mystical psychedelic experiences (MPE) is interpreted in terms of overcoming existential anxiety. The psychedelic experience is shown to be mystical by transcending the everyday mode of existential denial by facing the nothingness, transforming one’s stand within it into a stand of original belongingness to the field of emptiness (Nishitani).",

It discusses how these experiences can induce spiritual transformation. It also addresses different perspectives, including reductionist views, entheogenic views, and neuro-cognitive explanations (Letheby, 2021; Lyon, 2024).",

        "description": "The essay argues for a critically entheogenic view of MPE, exposing the ontological assumptions of modern naturalism as dogmatic objectivism and offering a Heidegger and Nishitani-based ontology. It contends that this view allows understanding mystical insights without reducing them to psychological effects or temporal distortions. The essay proposes that what is revealed in psychedelics is the divine nature of a non-Cartesian belongingness.",

        "description": "This section critiques the ontology of presence underlying scientific naturalism. It emphasizes that the “hard problem of consciousness” is rooted in an inadequate ontology shaped by elements of experienced reality. Heidegger’s perspective suggests that the mode of Being of nature is not reducible to mere presence but encompasses an essential element of absence. The section explores how the limitations of science in understanding experience stem from its focus on objective representation.",
