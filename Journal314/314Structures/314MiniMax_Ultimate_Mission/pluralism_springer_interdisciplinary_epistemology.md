Here's an analysis of the provided web content, focusing on the user's query about challenges and frameworks for interdisciplinary epistemological integration:

**Relevance:**

The web content is **highly relevant** to the query. It's an academic article from the *European Journal for Philosophy of Science* specifically addressing "Epistemology for interdisciplinary research." The article directly discusses challenges and frameworks for interdisciplinary epistemological integration.

**Detailed Extraction of Relevant Information:**

The article provides a comprehensive analysis of the user's query. Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**1. Challenges of Interdisciplinary Research (IDR):**

*   **Cognitive and Epistemic Difficulties:** The article argues that researchers experience cognitive and epistemic difficulties when conducting IDR, especially when solving "real-world" problems.
*   **Lack of Philosophical Interest:** The article suggests that the lack of philosophical interest in the epistemology of IDR is a significant challenge.
*   **Dominant Philosophical Paradigm:** The article identifies a "physics paradigm of science" as a barrier. This paradigm, prevalent in science education and research, prevents the recognition of epistemological challenges in IDR. This paradigm is characterized by:
    *   Aim of science: Focus on scientific theories for the sake of science.
    *   Emphasis on unity of science through integration of theories.
    *   Knowledge is a literal representation of the world.
*   **Disciplinary Perspectives:** The article identifies that different disciplines generate knowledge differently and that this can lead to difficulties in interdisciplinary settings.
*   **Metacognitive Skills:** The article discusses that teaching higher-order cognitive skills (metacognitive skills) as a crucial part of expertise in conducting interdisciplinary research remains underdeveloped in higher education.

**2. Proposed Frameworks and Approaches for Interdisciplinary Epistemological Integration:**

*   **Alternative Philosophical Paradigm (Engineering Paradigm of Science):**
    *   The article proposes an alternative "engineering paradigm of science" to address the challenges.
    *   This paradigm views knowledge as "epistemic tools" that are constructed and shaped within scientific disciplines.
    *   It emphasizes the production of knowledge for epistemic functions.
    *   It interprets "knowledge" as *epistemic tools* that must allow for conducting epistemic tasks by epistemic agents, rather than interpreting knowledge as *representations* that objectively represent aspects of the world independent of the way in which it was constructed.
    *   Knowledge is shaped by how it is constructed and the disciplinary perspective.
*   **Kuhnian Disciplinary Matrix (as a Framework):**
    *   The article suggests expanding Kuhn's idea of disciplinary matrices to analyze philosophical views of science.
    *   The *disciplinary matrix* is used to articulate the difference between the "physics paradigm" and "engineering paradigm."
    *   The expanded matrix has 13 elements to analyze philosophical views of science.
    *   The disciplinary matrix is a framework to analyze disciplinary perspectives of disciplines.
*   **Metacognitive Scaffolds (as Tools):**
    *   The article proposes using metacognitive scaffolds (also called matrices, or frameworks) as epistemic tools to assist interdisciplinary communication, aiming to analyze and articulate how knowledge is produced.
    *   The article suggests that the *disciplinary matrix* functions as a *metacognitive scaffold* that facilitates interdisciplinary communication on the characteristics of each discipline involved in an interdisciplinary research project.
    *   The B&K method for the (re)construction of scientific models can be interpreted as a metacognitive scaffold to assist in interdisciplinary communication.
    *   Concept-mapping can be interpreted as a metacognitive scaffold to assist in interdisciplinary communication.
*   **Disciplinary Perspectives:**
    *   Analyzing the *disciplinary perspective* of each discipline DA can be made explicit by means of the elements that constitute the *disciplinary matrix*.
    *   Acknowledging the contribution of the specificities of a discipline to the epistemic (and technological) results of scientific research stresses why metacognitive scaffolds (and the skills to use these scaffolds) are crucial to the researcher in interdisciplinary settings.
    *   To understand ‘knowledge’ of unfamiliar disciplines requires the ability to also recognize it as resulting from specific ways of thinking, experimenting, measuring and modeling within discipline DA.

**3. Key Terminology and Concepts:**

*   **Epistemology for Interdisciplinary Research (IDR):** The central theme of the article.
*   **Physics Paradigm of Science:** A traditional philosophical view of science that hinders understanding the epistemological challenges of IDR.
*   **Engineering Paradigm of Science:** An alternative philosophical view that offers a more appropriate framework for understanding IDR.
*   **Epistemic Tools:** Knowledge (theories, models, laws, concepts) viewed as tools for performing epistemic tasks.
*   **Disciplinary Perspectives:** The specific ways in which scientific disciplines construct knowledge, guided by their unique methodologies, assumptions, and goals.
*   **Disciplinary Matrix:** A framework (metacognitive scaffold) for analyzing and articulating the elements of a disciplinary perspective.
*   **Metacognitive Scaffolds:** Tools or frameworks (like disciplinary matrices) that support researchers in analyzing and understanding the epistemological aspects of their work, particularly in interdisciplinary contexts.
*   **Higher-order cognitive skills:** (metacognitive skills): Ability to search, identify, understand, critically appraise, connect, and integrate theories and methods of different disciplines and to apply the resulting cognitive advancement together with continuous evaluation.

**4. Comparisons:**

*   **Physics Paradigm vs. Engineering Paradigm (Table 1):** The article provides a detailed comparison of these two philosophical paradigms, outlining their differences across various dimensions (aim of science, ontology, methodology, etc.).
*   **Integration Metaphors:** It contrasts the "jigsaw-puzzle" and "conflict-resolution" metaphors of IDR with the "engineering-design" metaphor.
