I have reviewed the provided web content from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on "Nothingness." It contains comprehensive philosophical discussions on the topic and directly addresses the user's query.

Here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information:

**General Philosophical Information on Nothingness:**

*   **Definition and Historical Context:** The entry begins by defining nothingness and discussing its significance in metaphysics, the study of what exists. It traces the philosophical interest in nothingness back to the 5th century BCE in China, India, and Greece.
*   **The "Why is there something rather than nothing?" Question:** This is presented as a fundamental question in philosophy, framing the central problem of nothingness. The article explores various approaches to this question, including:
    *   Methodological principles (burden of proof, starting point, etc.)
    *   Simplicity and likelihood
    *   Statistical arguments (van Inwagen's argument)
    *   Equilibrium explanations from science
*   **Multiple Nothings:** The article examines the possibility of multiple voids or instances of nothingness, discussing the challenges and paradoxes this raises.

**Heidegger's Contribution to the Concept of *Nichts* (Nothingness):**

*   **Heidegger's Central Role:** The text explicitly references Martin Heidegger and his contributions to understanding nothingness. The article states that the question "Why is there something rather than nothing?" is famously characterized by Heidegger as the most fundamental issue of philosophy.
*   **Phenomenological Aspects:** The entry discusses the phenomenological aspects of nothingness, highlighting how existentialists, including Heidegger, provide detailed treatments of the awe and emotional experience of the question.
*   **Heidegger's View on Animals:** The article mentions Heidegger's skepticism regarding animal cognition of nothingness, suggesting he believed animals do not experience nothingness. This leads to a discussion of the philosophical implications for our understanding of negation and absences in animal reasoning.
*   **Carnap's Critique:** The article cites Rudolf Carnap's critique of Heidegger's language and his famous quote from "What is Metaphysics?" as an example of what he considered metaphysical nonsense.
*   **Freedom and Negation:** The entry notes that Heidegger believes freedom is rooted in nothingness and that we derive our concept of logical negation from the experience of nothing.

**Specific Sections Relevant to Heidegger:**

*   **Section 2: "Is there at most one empty world?"** While not directly focused on Heidegger, this section touches on the potential for different kinds of "nothingness" or empty worlds, which is indirectly relevant to understanding Heidegger's view of *Nichts.*
*   **Section 11: "Phenomenological aspects of nothingness"** This is the most relevant section, directly addressing Heidegger's views. It discusses his connection of nothingness with the human condition, moods, and emotions, with specific reference to *Pensées*.
*   **Section 12: "Animal Cognition of Absences"** This section discusses Heidegger's views on animal cognition, and relates to his specific perspective on what animals can or cannot experience (or what is available to them). It provides an indirect access point to Heidegger's perspective.

**Key Points & Arguments within the Content:**

*   The article explores the historical development of philosophical thought on nothingness.
*   It reviews prominent arguments, such as the subtraction argument, and the contingency dilemma.
*   It examines different perspectives on the nature of nothingness, including its relation to negation, existence, and the possibility of multiple "nothings."
*   The entry highlights the challenges in defining and understanding nothingness in both linguistic and metaphysical terms.
*   It presents the viewpoints of various philosophers on the subject and their interpretations of Heidegger's work.

The provided web content from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy provides a solid foundation for understanding the philosophical concept of nothingness and contains detailed information about Heidegger's contributions to the concept.
