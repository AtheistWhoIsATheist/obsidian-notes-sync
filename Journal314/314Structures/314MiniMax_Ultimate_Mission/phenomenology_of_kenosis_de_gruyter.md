**Relevance Determination:**

The provided web content is **highly relevant** to the user's query. The article, titled "Towards a Phenomenology of Kenosis: Thinking after the Theological Turn," directly addresses the core concepts of kenotic experiences, self-emptying, ontological change, and subjective experience. The abstract and subsequent sections explicitly discuss these themes within a philosophical and theological framework.

**Detailed Data Extraction:**

The following information is extracted from the article, focusing on the phenomenological aspects of kenosis, self-emptying, ontological change, and subjective experience, as requested in the prompt:

**1. Abstract:**

*   **Focus:** Sets the stage for a phenomenological approach to kenosis.
*   **Key Argument:** Proposes a "phenomenology of kenosis," which starts from theology (Paul's notion of kenosis) to move beyond it (de-theologize itself).
*   **Purpose:** To explore what thinking "after the theological turn" might mean.

**2. Keywords:**

*   phenomenology
*   theology
*   kenosis
*   continental philosophy of religion
*   theological turn
*   deconstruction
*   Jean-Luc Nancy

**3. Introduction:**

*   **Context:** Explains the need for a new direction in continental philosophy of religion, particularly in the wake of the "theological turn."
*   **Proposal:** Introduces the concept of a "phenomenology of kenosis" as a way to deconstruct the theological turn.
*   **Method:** Argues that a deconstruction of the theological turn can be accomplished by way of a "phenomenology of kenosis," a phenomenology that *starts from* theology (Paul’s notion of kenosis), precisely so as to *move beyond* it (to de-theologise itself).
*   **Goal:** To elucidate what thinking “after the theological turn” might mean, and to clear space for it.

**4. Section 2: Kenosis in Theology**

*   **Core Concept:** Introduces the theological concept of kenosis (Greek: κένωσις), the self-emptying of God in Jesus Christ, focusing on its implications for revelation, salvation, and incarnation.
*   **Focus:** Highlights Paul's understanding of kenosis in Philippians 2:5-11, emphasizing the self-emptying of divinity in the form of a servant.
*   **Key Point:** Kenosis is not about a metaphysical change in God's being, but about a change in the *form* of his manifestation.
*   **Quote:** "Jesus veils his glory under the form of a servant, in order to get near man for revelation and reconciliation, but in this, the veiling of the Son is a necessary part of his future unveiling for it is a means to its fulfilment, and so to achieving a reconciliation that is not only from the side of God to man but from the side of man to God." (Torrance)
*   **Revelation and Incarnation:** Kenosis is presented as integral to revelation, with the veiling or self-emptying being the mode of God's self-revelation.

**5. Section 3: Kenosis in Post-Theology**

*   **Context:** Addresses the appropriation of the kenotic motif by contemporary philosophers.
*   **Overview:** Discusses how philosophers like Levinas, Vattimo, and Nancy use kenosis in their work.
*   **Levinas:** Discusses Levinas's approach to kenosis, emphasizing it as the "humiliation of God" and as a disruption of traditional orders of transcendence.
    *   **Key Argument:** Kenosis provides a new understanding of transcendence as existing within, rather than beyond, the world.
    *   **Example:** The ethical dimension of human action is emphasized as the site where divinity is revealed.
*   **Vattimo:** Presents Vattimo's idea of "weakening" as a consequence of kenosis.
    *   **Key Argument:** Kenosis leads to the effacement of theological transcendence.
    *   **Concept:** "Secularization" as the essence of Christianity.
*   **Nancy:** Analyzes Nancy's deconstruction of Christianity, connecting kenosis to the self-deconstruction of Christianity.
    *   **Key Argument:** Christianity's kenotic doctrine is its self-deconstructive agent.
    *   **Concept:** Nancy's interest in Christianity is due to Christianity's own secularisation or de-theologisation.

**6. Section 4: Deconstructing the Theological Turn**

*   **Argument:** The "kenotic turn" provides a way to deconstruct the theological turn of phenomenology.
*   **Phenomenology of Kenosis:** Presents the idea of a "phenomenology of kenosis."
    *   **Objective:** To address the theological nature of phenomenological philosophical terms by going beyond theology.
    *   **Levels of Application:** Discusses how kenosis can be understood on various levels, moving from the self-emptying of divinity to the self-emptying of phenomenality.
    *   **Goal:** To offer a phenomenological account of incarnation and revelation, differing from the theological turn's approach.

**7. Conclusion:**

*   **Recap:** Summarizes the key arguments.
*   **Final Statement:** "Phenomenology must indeed turn to theology, but only to discover therein what is properly speaking “phenomenological” by immediately also moving beyond “the theological.”"

**Additional notes from the Article**

*   The article draws on a wide range of secondary sources from theologians and philosophers.
*   The article directly answers the query, presenting the framework for a "phenomenology of kenosis."
*   The article focuses on the idea of “self-emptying” as a central aspect of kenosis in various theological and philosophical contexts.
*   The article provides a framework for understanding how the concept of kenosis can lead to ontological changes and a new understanding of subjective experience.
