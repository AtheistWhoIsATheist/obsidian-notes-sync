**Title:** The 4 Stages of Ego Death

**Author:** Daniel Hannah

**Date:** May 3, 2025

**Summary:** The article discusses ego death as an experience where one temporarily dissolves the ego to experience a purer state of consciousness. It presents three main stages.

**Stages and Characteristics:**

1.  **Ego Dissolution:** This is a partial loss of self.
    *   The individual disassociates from reality but remains aware of being alive, able to think, remember, and understand their human existence.
    *   The individual is "not here completely."
    *   Requires surrender to move deeper.

2.  **The Surrender:** Before leaving the body, one must surrender to the experience.
    *   The ego resists what it perceives as death.
    *   If surrender is achieved, consciousness completely exits the body.
    *   The individual is at the mercy of the experience without the ability to control or do anything.

3.  **Ego Death:** This is the complete loss of self.
    *   The individual ceases to exist, along with the current realm of existence.
    *   Distinguished from sleep or a coma.
