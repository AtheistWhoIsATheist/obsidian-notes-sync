    *   **Harvest:** It is the time for harvesting the grain and fruit.
    *   **The All-Nourishing Abyss:** Lammas is associated with remembering the Dark Sentience, the All-Nourishing Abyss, from which all arises and to which all returns.
    *   **Transformation:** The Old One/Crone is seen as the wise, dark one who embraces and receives the harvest, dismantling what has passed. This aligns with the creative/generative principles of the PaGaian cosmology by honoring the transformative aspects of the Goddess.
*   **Connection to the Larger Organism (Gaia):** Lammas recognizes that individuals dissolve into the "night" of the Larger Organism (Gaia). Gaia is immortal, and individuals arise from and dissolve back into Her.
