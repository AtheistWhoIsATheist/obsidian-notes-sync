    *   **Meister Eckhart's perspective:** The article frequently references Eckhart, highlighting his use of "Nothingness" (with 82 references in *Passion For Creation: The Earth-Honoring Spirituality of Meister Eckhart*) and his concept of "negating negation". Eckhart's perspective is presented as seeing God as a "nameless nothingness."
    *   **The interplay of "Nothingness" and "Something":** The text points out that "Nothing and something dance together both in our souls and in the very bowels of the universe."

*   **Quotes and Ideas:**
    *   "Everything is both/and with the mystics—not either/or. There is no dualism there but there is a great invitation for us all to stretch as we become truer to our deepest selves, our mystical selves. And to touch both Isness and the All as well Nothing."
    *   "The ground of our soul is dark,” says Eckhart. Hidden. Mysterious. Without a name. Even 'ineffable like God is.'"
    *   "Eckhart encourages us not to be afraid of nothingness, but to enter in so fully that we learn the meaning of God as nothingness and what it means to 'negate negation.'"
    *   "Nothingness" can mean no-thing. Something more mysterious and more relational than a thing. God is a no-thing; Eckhart calls God, among other things, a "nameless nothingness."
