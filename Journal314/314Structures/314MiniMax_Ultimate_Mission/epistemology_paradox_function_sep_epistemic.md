    "content_summary": "The provided web content is an entry from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) on Epistemic Paradoxes. It defines epistemic paradoxes as riddles centered on the concept of knowledge, highlighting their nature as posing conflicting answers and challenging accepted assumptions. The entry discusses various epistemic paradoxes, including the Surprise Test Paradox, Intellectual Suicide, Lotteries and the Lottery Paradox, Preface Paradox, and Anti-expertise paradoxes, detailing their structures, implications, and proposed solutions. The nature of these paradoxes involves questions that may challenge well-credentialed principles of logic, probability, and rationality. The content also examines the historical context and philosophical implications of these paradoxes, including their connections to skepticism, dogmatism, and the limits of knowledge and belief.",
