**Detailed Extraction of Information:**

Here's a detailed extraction of information about the phenomenology of ego dissolution, any described stages, and its relevance to cognitive neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy, as presented in the provided article:

**1. Definition and Phenomenology of Drug-Induced Ego Dissolution (DIED):**

*   **Definition:** DIED is a significant alteration of self-experience characterized by the dissolution of the sense of self and the loss of boundaries between self and world.
*   **Historical Context:** The term "ego dissolution" emerged in the 1950s to describe effects observed with LSD and mescaline. Alternative expressions used in the late 50s and early 60s include "ego disintegration," "ego loss," and "ego death."
*   **Subjective Experiences:**
    *   Blurring or complete disappearance of boundaries between one's body and its environment.
    *   Feelings of numbness.
    *   "Feelings of non-existence."
    *   Fear of "impending dissolution."
    *   Feelings of disembodiment.
    *   Feelings of unity with the universe.
    *   Loss of self-awareness.
    *   Feeling of dying.
    *   Loss of sense of bodily ownership.
    *   Failure to recognize oneself in a mirror.
*   **Quantitative Measurement:**
    *   The Dittrich's Abnormal Mental States (APZ) questionnaire and its revised versions (OAV and 5D-ASC) are used to measure altered states of consciousness.
    *   These questionnaires measure *Oceanic Boundlessness* (OBN), *Dread of Ego Dissolution* (DED), and *Visionary Restructuralization* (VR).
    *   OBN is associated with positively experienced ego dissolution (feelings of unity, depersonalization, derealization).
    *   DED measures distressing experiences of depersonalization, thought disorder, and loss of thought and body control.
    *   The Ego Dissolution Inventory (EDI) is a new 8-item questionnaire designed specifically to measure DIED. It assesses experiences of ego dissolution and ego inflation.
    *   The EDI score was found to be strongly correlated with experiences induced by classical psychedelics.
*   **Etiology**:
    *   Psychedelics, dissociative anesthetics and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists.
    *   Emotional valence may vary: DIED can be experienced positively (OBN scale) or negatively (DED scale).
    *   Factors such as personality traits, previous experience, expectations, mood, and environment can influence the experience.

**2. Neuropharmacology of DIED:**

*   **Three main neuropharmacological classes of drugs that can induce DIED:**
    *   **Classical Psychedelics:**
        *   Mechanism: Act as agonists of the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor subtype.
        *   Examples: LSD, psilocybin, DMT, mescaline.
        *   5-HT2A receptor activation is specifically responsible for mediating the main subjective effects.
        *   Neurophysiological Effects:
            *   5-HT2A receptors are densely present in high-level association cortical areas.
            *   Excitation of deep layer V pyramidal neurons in the cortex.
            *   Desynchronization of cortical activity (EEG and MEG).
            *   Decreases in cerebral blood flow and BOLD signal in high-association "hubs" of the cortex, including the thalamus, ACC, PCC, and mPFC.
            *   Reduction of DMN activity.
            *   Increased DMN-TPN functional connectivity.
            *   PCC-mPFC decoupling.
            *   Decreased alpha oscillatory activity in the PCC (linked to sense of self).
            *   DMN-MTL decoupling.
            *   Increase in global functional connectivity in high-level association cortices and the thalamus.
            *   Increased cross-talk between the angular gyrus, the insula, and other brain networks.
    *   **Dissociative Anesthetics:**
        *   Mechanism: Primarily act as antagonists of the *N-*methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor.
        *   Examples: Ketamine, PCP, MK-801, DXM.
        *   Psychotomimetic characteristics and resemble symptoms of schizophrenia.
        *   Neurophysiological Effects:
            *   Increase in glutamate release.
            *   Aberrant activation of the PCC.
            *   Increase activity in the mid-PCC, thalamus, and temporal cortical regions.
            *   Decreased activity in ventromedial frontal cortex.
            *   Decreased resting-state functional connectivity of the DMN to the dorsal nexus.
            *   Ketamine decreases resting-state functional connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex.
    *   **Kappa Opioid Receptor (KOR) Agonists:**
        *   Mechanism: Selective KOR agonists.
        *   Examples: Salvinorin-A (from *Salvia divinorum*), enadoline.
        *   Neurophysiological Effects:
            *   KORs are expressed with high density in the striatum, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and deep cortical layers.
            *   May be due to over-activation of the KOR population in the claustrum.
            *   Alterations of bodily self-consciousness may result from the indirect effect of claustrum activation on parietal cortical areas.

**3. Significance of DIED for Cognitive Neuroscience:**

*   **Methodological Issues:**
    *   Studying DIED can reveal which functional brain configuration is essential to maintain a sense of self.
    *   Neural correlates of DIED may indicate the *necessary* neurophysiological conditions for the maintenance of the sense of self but not the *sufficient* ones.
    *   The meaning of the term "self" is complex and multi-faceted.
*   **The Broad Dichotomy Between Two Concepts of Self:**
    *   **Minimal/Embodied Self:** Basic experience of being a self rooted in bodily sensorimotor processes.
    *   **Narrative Self:** Construction of personal identity shaped by social and cultural factors.
*   **Computational Models of Minimal Selfhood:**
    *   Bayesian models and predictive coding are used to model the minimal/embodied self.
    *   The brain is a hypothesis-testing machine, and the brain's predictions depend on top-down prior expectations.
    *   DIED may be linked to a disruption of top-down and bottom-up processes modulating the multisensory integration of self-related stimuli.

**4. Significance of DIED for Philosophy of Mind:**

*   **Phenomenal Consciousness and Self-Awareness:**
    *   DIED challenges the claim that one is self-aware whenever one is conscious.
    *   The subjective character principle (SCP) states that a mental state is phenomenally conscious if and only if it has subjective character.
    *   The self-awareness principle (SAP) states that whenever one is in a conscious state, one is minimally self-aware.
    *   DIED experiences may challenge SAP by suggesting that consciousness can exist without a sense of self.
*   **Phenomenology of Minimal Selfhood:**
    *   DIED experiences suggest that a background awareness of self can become prominent when it is altered.
    *   DIED experiences present an interest for philosophers as a potential challenge to the idea that there is no phenomenology of the self.
    *   DIED can be interpreted as a mere disruption of high-level processes or as a disruption of the minimal self rooted in bodily and sensorimotor processes.

**5. Future Directions:**

*   Fine-grained descriptions of the experience from onset to end.
*   Use of micro-phenomenological techniques.
*   Incorporation of first-person methods within neurocognitive studies.
*   Complementary use of quantitative and qualitative methods.

**6. Keywords:**

*   Self-awareness
*   Minimal self
*   Phenomenology
*   Psychedelics
*   Dissociatives
*   Depersonalization
*   Psychosis
