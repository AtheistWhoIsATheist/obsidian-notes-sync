        "attribute": "Ineffability",
        "explanation": "The One is ineffable because it transcends Being, is timeless, immaterial, space-less, and unchanging; hence, it is even incorrect to try to define it. The One is the ultimate cause, a total unity that transcends Being. It is not a simple entity, as illustrated by the argument that a deity, which is composite, cannot be the ultimate cause."
      },
      {
        "attribute": "Transcending Being",
        "explanation": "The One transcends Being. It is the first cause and originator of the universe, an uncaused entity, a total unity that exists beyond Being."
      },
      {
        "attribute": "Timelessness",
        "explanation": "The One is timeless. Because it created time, it transcends time. The first cause is timeless."
      },
      {
        "attribute": "Immateriality",
        "explanation": "The One is immaterial. The ultimate cause is immaterial. It is also space-less and unchanging."
      },
      {
        "attribute": "Nature of the One",
        "details": "The One is the absolute unity and source. The One does not think or will, it is part-less, it is neither in motion nor at rest; it “exists” outside time and space, and does not partake in being. The existence of the world is possible by the existence of unity. All objects in the world and the world itself are unities. The One is the paradigm of unity—and that is the One. The One does not intend or need to produce anything. The One is also the Good."

        "attribute": "Accomplishments of Plotinus’ Philosophy",
        "details": "The discussion focuses on three main accomplishments of Plotinus’ philosophy: 1. The completeness of Plotinus’ ontological system. 2. A solution to the problems that Plato’s theory of Forms faced. 3. Plotinus’ theodicy."
      },
      {
        "attribute": "Relation to Intellect, Soul and Matter",
        "details": "The One's emanation generates Intellect, Soul, and matter. The One is the ultimate cause of the universe. Intellect and Soul partake in the Good."
      },
      {
        "attribute": "Emanation",
        "details": "Plotinus introduced the process of ceaseless production through emanation and outflowing from the One. The One's emanation is a sort of indirect process that generates Intellect, Soul, and matter."
      },
       {
        "attribute": "Solution to Plato's Forms",
        "details": "Plotinus's solution is such an elegant and simple one that it makes one wonder how Plato’s successors failed to contemplate it. Since the Forms are not physical entities, there is no reason to expect them to behave as such. They are not temporal entities that confer certain properties upon matter by separating and distributing their unity. They do not cause physical forms, since they are not bound by causality. Rather, they constantly emanate their properties and affect physical objects. This is compared to the sun whose emanation gives off heat to the world."
      },
        {
        "attribute": "Theodicy",
        "details": "Plotinus's theodicy addresses the issue of evil with respect to the originator of the universe, the One, which is the Good. Plotinus offers a solution to show that a) metaphysical evil is not—and cannot—be produced by the Good. Plotinus makes an important distinction between metaphysical evil and moral evil. Metaphysical evil exists as a result of the total privation of Good, and the locus of it is matter; hence, it is not the Good that produces metaphysical evil because the Good does not produce matter. Matter is produced by Soul, not as an evil act, but rather as ontological necessity. And b) moral evil is not evil itself, but rather evil in the second degree, i.e., human’ experience of many instances of evil and the infliction of evils by humans upon others. Moral evils occur because the soul is, as it were, crippled by matter."
