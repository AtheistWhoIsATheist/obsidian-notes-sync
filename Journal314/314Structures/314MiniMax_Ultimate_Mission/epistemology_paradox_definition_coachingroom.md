The web content is relevant to the query. It defines a paradox and discusses its relation to non-duality. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Definition of Paradox:**

*   A paradox is defined as an opinion, proposition, or statement that contradicts itself and may seem false, yet it is true.
*   It emphasizes that for something to be a paradox, there need to be two contradictory elements.
*   The content highlights the relational nature of the opposing elements within a paradox, as one cannot exist without the other.

**Relation to Non-Duality:**

*   The content explores the idea that if one element of a paradox does not exist without the other, there might be no separation between them, which is central to the concept of non-duality.
*   Non-duality is presented as a universal oneness, contradicting the belief that for something to be one, it needs to be the same.
*   The text asks whether differences can exist without being separate, drawing a parallel to the seemingly different yet interconnected nature of paradoxes.
*   It suggests that all things are different expressions of the same source, connected at the source.
*   The text provides an example of body parts (toes, foot, ankle, leg) to illustrate the interconnectedness, emphasizing the continuum and lack of separation within the human body as an analogy to non-duality.
*   Non-duality is presented as the absence of separation.
