# On the relationship between awe and the sublime:

**Relevance:**

The web content is highly relevant to the query. It's a mini-review article published in *Frontiers in Psychology* titled "Awe and the Experience of the Sublime: A Complex Relationship." The entire article is dedicated to exploring the connection between awe, as understood by psychologists, and the sublime, as discussed by philosophers.

**Detailed Extraction of Relevant Information:**

The article thoroughly examines the relationship between awe and the experience of the sublime, addressing the key aspects of the user's query:

*   **Defining Awe:** Awe is presented as a complex emotion or emotional construct with positive (contentment, happiness) and negative affective components (fear, sense of being smaller).
*   **Elicitors of Awe/Sublime:** The article explicitly links the elicitors of awe to what philosophical aesthetics, particularly Burke and Kant, have termed "the sublime." Examples of stimuli that trigger experiences of the sublime are provided: "Huge and steep mountains, starry night skies, waterfalls, grand canyons, deserts, thunderstorms."
*   **Ambivalent Valence:** Both awe and the experience of the sublime share an ambivalent valence. They have an overall positive valence, but also involve negative affective evaluations.
*   **Philosophical and Psychological Perspectives:** The article highlights the historical lack of study of the sublime in psychology, while awe is explored. It highlights the aim of bridging these domains through interdisciplinary collaboration.
*   **Seven Views on the Relationship:** The core of the article presents seven distinct perspectives on how awe and the experience of the sublime relate to each other. These are:
    *   A. Awe and ES are the same type of experience.
    *   B. Awe is an ingredient of ES.
    *   C. ES is an ingredient of awe.
    *   D. ES is a species of awe.
    *   E. Awe is a species of ES.
    *   F. Awe and ES share only a proper part.
    *   G. Awe and ES are unrelated to each other.
*   **Detailed Discussion of Each View:** The article explores each of these views in depth, providing arguments, counterarguments, and references to relevant philosophical and psychological literature.
*   **Vastness and Power:** The article explicitly mentions vastness and power as key components of the sublime experience. The experience arises when confronted with vastness or power.
*   **Fear/Dread and Emptiness/Overwhelming Presence:** The article discusses the role of negative affective components such as fear and the feeling of being small in awe. The experience of the sublime involves something like terror, fear, or a feeling of self-negation, mirroring the potential for fear and dread. The experience confronts an overwhelming vastness or power, which relates to the idea of an overwhelming presence.
*   **Specific Claims:**
    *   Keltner and Haidt (2003) explicitly tie the concept of awe to the philosophical concept of the sublime and see an analogy between awe and the aspects of power and obscurity in Burke's analysis of the sublime.
    *   Some studies suggest the existence of two sorts of awe experiences, a positive and a negative one, that can be distinguished along several dimensions.
    *   The article explores the view that ES could be a species of awe (D), specifically aesthetic awe, and how this relates to the positive and negative aspects of the experience.

**Statistical Information:**

*   The article references multiple studies with specific findings, though not always presenting exact percentages or raw data. For example, it references Piff et al. (2015) and Rivera et al. (2019) regarding positive and negative awe experiences. It also mentions a study by Pelowski et al. (2019) in which the vast majority of reports (90.8%) could be classified under one category associated with positive emotions.

**Comparisons:**

*   The article frequently compares and contrasts the understanding of awe within psychology and the experience of the sublime within philosophy.
*   It compares and contrasts different views on how awe and the sublime are related (the seven views).

**References:**

The article is rich in references to both philosophical and psychological literature. Here are some key references mentioned:

*   Keltner, D., and Haidt, J. (2003).
*   Burke, E. (1759).
*   Kant, I. (1790/2000).
*   Brady, E. (2013).
*   Piff et al. (2015).
*   Ishizu, T., and Zeki, S. (2014)
*   Pelowski et al. (2019).
