**Relevance Analysis:**

The web content is a blog post titled "The Interplay of Kataphatic And Apophatic Theology" by Henry Karlson on the Patheos website. This directly addresses the user's query. The article explicitly discusses both kataphatic and apophatic theology and their relationship.

**Data Extraction:**

The article provides arguments for why apophatic and cataphatic theology must work together:

*   **Avoiding an Unbalanced Understanding of God:** The central argument is that both approaches are needed to avoid an unbalanced view.
    *   **Kataphatic theology (affirmative theology):** It is theology that explores the way the divine nature *can* be spoken about, from the knowledge we get from God's revelations. It is important because we can and *do* know things about God. If we didn't have this form of theology, we would be denying the truth that inspired it.
    *   **Apophatic theology (negative theology):** It is theology that explores the way the divine nature *transcends* what can be said about God. Its value is to remind us of the limits of human language and the limits of all theological constructs.
*   **Dangers of Embracing One Without the Other:**
    *   **Kataphatic without Apophatic:** This can lead to the belief that we can fully comprehend God. This can lead to treating conventional truths as absolutes, creating idols, and limiting our understanding of God. It also suggests that humans are either equals or superiors to God.
    *   **Apophatic without Kataphatic:** This can lead to nihilism, the denial of all truth. It would deny the value of kataphatic theology, and any attempt to talk about God is equally as false as calling a dog a cat.
*   **How They Work Together:**
    *   Apophatic theology helps to preserve and protect the absolute truth, allowing for a more complete and fuller understanding of God.
    *   Apophatic theology is a tool, the point of which is to remove the clutter that gets in the way of our *experience* of God and to preserve and protect God's ability to interact with us.
    *   Kataphatic theology helps us reflect on our experiences with God, which will go hand-in-hand with our apprehensions and conventions, making sure we never treat conventions as literal.

**Supporting arguments:**

*   The apophatic way is a tool which is meant to *preserve and protect* the absolute truth and not deny it.
*   Apophatic theology and its methodology is meant to *preserve and protect* the transcendence of God.
*   The article quotes several sources to support these arguments.
