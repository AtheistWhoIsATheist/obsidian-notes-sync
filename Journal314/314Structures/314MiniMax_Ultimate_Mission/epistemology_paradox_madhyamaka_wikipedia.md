The web content is from Wikipedia and comprehensively covers Madhyamaka philosophy, including the concept of emptiness (śūnyatā), its relationship to inherent existence, and its implications for a transcendental reality.

Here's a detailed extraction based on the query:

**1. Philosophical Overview**

*   **Śūnyatā (Emptiness):** The central idea of Madhyamaka is that all phenomena (*dharmas*) are empty (*śūnya*) of *svabhāva*.
    *   *Svabhāva* is translated as essence, intrinsic nature, inherent existence, own being, and substance.
    *   *Svabhāva* can be interpreted as either "identity" or as "causal independence."
    *   Madhyamaka primarily refutes substance-*svabhāva*, the objective and independent existence of any object or concept.
    *   Emptiness itself is also "empty"; it does not have an independent existence nor does it refer to a transcendental reality beyond phenomenal reality.
    *   Emptiness is a corrective to mistaken conceptions of how things exist.
    *   The concept of *svabhāva* that Madhyamaka denies is a cognitive distortion that beings automatically impose on the world.

*   **Four Corners (Catuṣkoṭi):** A common structure Madhyamaka uses to negate *svabhāva*:
    *   A proposition is true
    *   A proposition is false
    *   A proposition is both true and false
    *   A proposition is neither true nor false

*   **Svabhava and the Four Extremes:** Nāgārjuna's critique of own-nature in chapter 15 of the *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* (MMK) argues that:
    *   Anything that arises according to conditions has no inherent nature.
    *   If there is nothing with own-nature, there can be nothing with 'other-nature' (*para-bhava*), i.e. something which is dependent for its existence and nature on something *else* which has own-nature.
    *   If there is neither own-nature nor other-nature, there cannot be anything with a true, substantial existent nature (*bhava*).
    *   If there is no true existent, then there can be no non-existent (*abhava*).

*   **Dependent Arising:** The classical Buddhist doctrine of dependent arising cannot be reconciled with a conception of self-nature or substance and that therefore essence theories are contrary not only to the Buddhist scriptures but to the very ideas of causality and change.
    *   Nāgārjuna writes in the MMK:
        *   "We state that conditioned origination is emptiness. It is mere designation depending on something, and it is the middle path. (24.18)"
        *   "Since nothing has arisen without depending on something, there is nothing that is not empty. (24.19)"

*   **Two Truths:** Madhyamaka discerns two levels of truth:
    *   Conventional truth (everyday commonsense reality).
    *   Ultimate truth (emptiness).
    *   The phenomenal world is the limited truth – *saṃvṛti satya,* which means "to cover", "to conceal", or "obscure."
        *   Saṃvṛti also means "conventional", as in a customary, norm based, agreed upon truth (like linguistic conventions) and it is also glossed as *vyavahāra-satya* (transactional truth).
        *   Chandrakirti also has a third explanation of saṃvṛti, which is "mutual dependence" (*parasparasaṃbhavana*).
    *   *Paramartha satya* is the highest truth realized by wisdom.
    *   The two truths are not two metaphysical realities; the two realities refer to just what is experienced by two different types of beings with different types and scopes of perception.
    *   The distinction between the two truths is primarily epistemological and dependent on the cognition of the observer, not ontological.
    *   The seeming reality is the world of samsara because conceiving of concrete and unchanging objects leads to clinging and suffering.

*   **Ultimate Reality:**
    *   Nāgārjuna associates emptiness with the ultimate truth, but his conception of emptiness is not some kind of Absolute, but rather it is the very absence of true existence with regards to the conventional reality of things and events in the world.
    *   Because the ultimate is itself empty, it is also explained as a "transcendence of deception" and hence is a kind of apophatic truth which experiences the lack of substance.
    *   Because the nature of ultimate reality is said to be empty, empty even of "emptiness" itself, both the concept of "emptiness" and the very framework of the two truths are also mere conventional realities, not part of the ultimate.
    *   This is often called "the emptiness of emptiness".
    *   The two truths themselves are therefore just a practical tool used to teach others, but do not exist within the actual meditative equipoise that realizes the ultimate.
    *   Atisha describes the ultimate as "here, there is no seeing and no seer, no beginning and no end, just peace.... It is nonconceptual and nonreferential ... it is inexpressible, unobservable, unchanging, and unconditioned."
    *   The ultimate is inexpressible as either "one" or "different."

*   **The Middle Way:**
    *   Madhyamaka is a Middle Way (*madhyamāpratipad*) between nihilism and eternalism.
    *   Madhyamaka philosophers explicitly rejected the nihilist interpretation from the outset.
    *   All things are mere conceptual constructs (*prajñaptimatra*) because they are just impermanent collections of causes and conditions.
    *   Views of absolute or eternalist existence (such as the Hindu ideas of Brahman or *sat-dravya*) and nihilism are both equally untenable.
    *   Essentialism or eternalism (*sastavadava*) – a belief that things inherently or substantially exist and are therefore efficacious objects of craving and clinging.
    *   Nihilism or annihilationism (*ucchedavada*) – encompassing views that could lead one to believe that there is no need to be responsible for one's actions.

*   **Usefulness of Reason:**
    *   Reason and debate are understood as a means to an end (liberation).
    *   Reason and logical arguments are empty of any true validity or reality.
    *   Nāgārjuna's *Vigrahavyāvartanī* famously attacked the notion that one could establish a valid cognition or epistemic proof (*pramana*).
    *   Madhyamaka's arguments, just like all things, are not *ultimately* valid in some foundational sense.
    *   The point of Madhyamaka reasoning is not to establish any abstract validity or universal truth, it is simply a pragmatic project aimed at ending delusion and suffering.
    *   Madhyamaka uses language to make clear the limits of our concepts.

*   **Soteriology:**
    *   The realization of emptiness allows one to reach liberation or nirvana.
    *   Insight of dependent origination – that nothing arises or happens independently.
    *   The cognitive shift which sees the nonexistence of *svabhāva* leads to the cessation of suffering.
    *   The ultimate aim of understanding emptiness is the actualization of a liberated mind.
    *   Meditation on emptiness may proceed in stages, starting with the emptiness of self, of objects and of mental states.

*   **Does Madhyamaka have a position?:**
    *   Nāgārjuna argued that his philosophy was not a view.
    *   Madhyamaka can be said to have the "thesis of emptiness" only conventionally, in the context of debating or explaining it.

**2. Origins and Sources**

*   **Early Buddhist Texts:** Nāgārjuna cites the "Advice to Kātyāyana" from the *Kaccānagotta Sutta* (Saṃyutta Nikāya ii.16–17 / SN 12.15, with parallel in the Chinese *Saṃyuktāgama* 301). The *Kaccānagotta Sutta* itself says: "This world, Kaccāna, for the most part depends on a duality – upon the notion of existence and the notion of nonexistence."
*   **Mahāyāna Sūtras:** The *Prajñāpāramitā*, *Ratnakūṭa*, *Avataṃsaka*, *Vimalakīrtinirdeṣa*, the *Śuraṃgamasamādhi,* the *Saddharmapuṇḍarīka*, the *Daśabhūmika*, the *Akṣayamatinirdeśa*, the *Tathāgataguhyaka*, and the *Kāśyapaparivarta*.
*   **Prajñāpāramitā:** Madhyamaka thought is closely related to the *Prajñāpāramitā* sūtras.
    *   Prajñā or 'higher cognition' is a synonym of abhidharma, 'insight' (vipaśyanā) and 'analysis of the dharmas' (*dharmapravicaya*).
    *   Nagarjuna's work alludes to the prajñaparamita sutras.

**3. Indian Madhyamaka**

*   **Nāgārjuna:** The founder of Madhyamaka, he used *reductio ad absurdum* arguments (*prasanga*) to show that any theory of substance or essence was unsustainable, and therefore, phenomena (*dharmas*) were empty (*sunya*) of any essential existence.
*   **Classical Madhyamaka figures:**
    *   **Āryadeva:** Supplemented Nāgārjuna's work with his "400 verses".
    *   **Buddhapalita:** Developed the prāsaṅgika approach to Nāgārjuna's works, critiquing essentialism mainly through reductio ad absurdum arguments.
    *   **Bhāvaviveka:** Argued for the use of logical arguments using the *pramana* based epistemology of Indian logicians. This approach has been labeled the *svātantrika* style of Madhyamaka.
    *   **Candrakīrti:** Defended Buddhapālita and critiqued Bhāvaviveka's position.
    *   **Śāntideva:** Well known for his philosophical poem discussing the bodhisattva path and the six paramitas, the *Bodhicaryāvatāra*.

**4. Tibetan Buddhism**

*   **Early transmission:** Yogacara-Madhyamaka Śāntarakṣita (725–788), and his students Haribhadra and Kamalashila (740–795) as well as the later Kadampa figures of Atisha (982–1054) and his pupil Dromtön (1005–1064).
*   **Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika interpretations:**
    *   Tibetan Buddhism made a distinction between Autonomist (*Svātantrika, rang rgyud pa*) and Consequentialist (*Prāsaṅgika, Thal 'gyur pa*) approaches to Madhyamaka reasoning.
    *   The Svātantrika states that conventional phenomena are understood to have a conventional essential existence, but without an ultimately existing essence.
    *   The central technique avowed by the *prasaṅgika* is to show by **prasaṅga** (or reductio ad absurdum) that any positive assertion or view regarding phenomena must be regarded as merely conventional.
*   **Jonang and "Other Emptiness":** Dölpopa Shérap Gyeltsen (1292–1361), viewed the Buddha and Buddha Nature as *not* intrinsically empty, but as truly real. The Jonang position came to be known as [[Rangtong and shentong|"emptiness of other" (**gzhan stong, shentong*)*]].
*   **Tsongkhapa and Gelug *Prāsaṅgika*:**
    *   The Gelug school was founded in the beginning of the 15th century by Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419).
    *   Tsongkhapa maintained that the ultimate truth could be understood conceptually, an understanding which could later be transformed into a non-conceptual one.
    *   Tsongkhapa's doctrine of the object of negation.
    *   For Tsongkhapa, conventional truth is "a kind of truth", "a way of being real" and "a kind of existence."
*   **Sakya Madhyamaka:** Gorampa Sonam Senge (1429–1489), was an important Sakya philosopher which defended the orthodox Sakya Madhyamaka position, critiquing both Dolpopa and Tsongkhapa's interpretations.
    *   For Gorampa, emptiness is not just the absence of inherent existence, but it is the absence of the four extremes in all phenomena.
    *   Gorampa's Madhyamaka negates *existence* *itself* or existence without qualifications, while for Tsongkhapa, the object of negation is "inherent existence".
*   **Kagyu:** There is a broad field of opinion on the nature of emptiness, with some holding the "other empty" (*shentong*) view while others holding different positions.
*   **Nyingma Madhyamaka:** In the Nyingma school, like in Kagyu, there is a variety of views. The most influential Nyingma thinkers like Longchenpa and Ju Mipham held a more classical prāsaṅgika interpretation.

**5. East Asian madhyamaka**

*   **Sānlùn school:** Chinese madhyamaka (known as *sānlùn,* or the three treatise school) began with the work of Kumārajīva (344–413 CE).
    *   Sengzhao (384–414), points out that the nature of phenomena cannot be taken as being either existent or inexistent.
    *   Jizang (549–623) was another central figure in Chinese madhyamaka.
*   **Chán:** The Chán/Zen-tradition emulated madhyamaka-thought, influencing its supposedly "illogical" way of communicating "absolute truth".

**6. Modern Scholarship**

*   Western scholarship has given a broad variety of interpretations of madhyamaka, including: "nihilism, monism, irrationalism, misology, agnosticism, scepticism, criticism, dialectic, mysticism, acosmism, absolutism, relativism, nominalism, and linguistic analysis with therapeutic value."
*   Modern interpreters differ among themselves about the correct way to read it as least as much as canonical interpreters.
