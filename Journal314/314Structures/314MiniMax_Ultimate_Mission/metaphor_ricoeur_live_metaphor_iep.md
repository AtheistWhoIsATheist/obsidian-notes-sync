The provided web content from the *Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy* contains substantial and relevant information on Paul Ricoeur's concept of "live metaphor" and its role in creating new meaning and referring to reality.

Here's a detailed extraction:

**3. Existential Phenomenology: Paul Ricoeur, Hermeneutics, and Metaphor**

*   **Overview:** Ricoeur revisits Husserlian and Heideggerian themes in his treatment of metaphor. He develops a discursive theory of symbol, focusing on symbols in religious texts and sacred narratives. He sees metaphor as a re-appropriation of our effort to exist.
*   **Key Idea:** Metaphor must include the notion that such language is expressive and constitutive of the being of those who embark on philosophical reflection.
*   **Central Claim:** "the symbol gives rise to the thought."
*   **Method:** Ricoeur centers the creation of meaning in the existential context, reflecting on experience. The noetic act originates in the encounter with a living text.

**a. The Mechanics of Conceptual Blending**

*   **Focus:** Signifying power of metaphor lies primarily at the sentence level, not individual terms. It is a discursive act which achieves its purpose through extended predication rather than simple substitution.
*   **Theory of Language:** Works through a structure of double reference.
*   **Category Mistake:** Ricoeur reads metaphorical transfer as a kind of "category mistake," which produces an imaginative construction about new ways objects may be related to one another.
*   **Semantic Gap:** A "nameless act" is a kind of "cognitive leap" since there is no conventional term for it. This gap results in a new meaning association, creating a metaphor that signals the larger discursive context.
*   **Role of Metaphor:** The figurative acts as a hermeneutic medium that negates and displaces the original term, signifying a "new kind of object," a new form of being (*logos*).
*   **Outcome:** The metaphorical statement allows us to say that an object *is and is not* what we usually call it.

**b. The Role of Kant’s Schematism in Conceptual Blending**

*   **Objective:** Ricoeur addresses how metaphoric representations of reality can "refer" to reality through Kant's theory of object construction.
*   **Kant's Schematism:** Used by the imagination to guide it in the construction of images, supporting the cognitive contribution to the semantic innovation produced by metaphor. It provides a structure for assigning truth value.

**Key Takeaways on Ricoeur's Live Metaphor:**

*   Ricoeur moves beyond the substitution model of metaphor.
*   He emphasizes the sentence level and discourse over individual words.
*   Metaphor is a cognitive act that creates new meaning through conceptual blending.
*   The "nameless act" creates new meaning associations.
*   It utilizes a structure of double reference, where a word can both be and not be what it is usually called.
*   He uses Kant's schematism to explain how these metaphors refer to reality, emphasizing the role of the imagination in creating meaning.
*   His theory is a *hermeneutic* act directed to the gap between abstract reflection and living life.
