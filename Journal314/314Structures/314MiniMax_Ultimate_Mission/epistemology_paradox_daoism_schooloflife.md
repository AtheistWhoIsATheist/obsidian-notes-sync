  "relevance": "The web content is highly relevant to the query. It contains a detailed article about Wu Wei and its connection to Daoism, explicitly mentioning the *Dao De Jing* and the concept of 'The Way never acts yet nothing is left undone'.",
  "extracted_information": {
    "concept": "Wu Wei (無爲)",
    "definition": "Non-doing or ‘doing nothing’ in Chinese.",
    "daoism_connection": "Key to the noblest kind of action according to Daoism. At the heart of what it means to follow the Dao, or The Way.",
    "dao_de_jing_quote": "'The Way never acts yet nothing is left undone'.",
    "paradox_of_wu_wei": "It doesn’t mean not acting, it means ‘effortless action’ or ‘actionless action’",
    "wu_wei_and_natural_world": "Closely connected to the Daoist reverence for the natural world; striving to make our behavior as spontaneous and inevitable as certain natural processes. We are to be like the bamboo that bends in the wind or the plant that adjusts itself to the shape of a tree.",
    "wu_wei_involves": "Letting go of ideals that we may otherwise try to force too violently onto things; responding to the true demands of situations.",
    "outcome_of_wu_wei": "A loss of self-consciousness, a new unity between the self and its environment, which releases an energy that is normally held back by an overly aggressive, wilful style of thinking.",
    "wu_wei_and_water_metaphor": "We should be like water, which is ‘submissive and weak’ and ‘yet which can’t be surpassed for attacking what is hard and strong’.",
    "wu_wei_in_politics_diplomacy_and_business": "Letting others act frantically, and then lightly adjust ourselves as we see the direction that matters have evolved in.",
    "wu_wei_in_Tang_dynasty_poetry": "Many poets likened *wu wei* to the best aspects of being drunk.",
    "wu_wei_in_painting": "The artist should find nature within themselves and surrender to its calls. The painter’s task is not to imitate the external surface of things, but to present the *qi* or ‘spirit’ of things like mountains, trees, birds and rivers by feeling some of this spirit in themselves and then letting it flow out through the brush onto silk or paper.",
    "artist_example": "The Tang dynasty poet, Fu Zai, described a big party that had been thrown to witness the painter Zhang Zao in action, who would fling his ink and spread it with his hands on a silk scroll, to create spontaneous forms that he then worked up into expressive images of nature. All this was *wu wei*.",
    "conclusion": "This Daoist concept captures a distinctive wisdom we may at times be in desperate need of, when we are in danger of damaging ourselves through an overly stern and unyielding adherence to ideas which simply cannot fit the demands of the world as it is."
