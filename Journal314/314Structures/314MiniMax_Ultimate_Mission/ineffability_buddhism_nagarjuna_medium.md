**Detailed Extraction of Relevant Information:**

The article, "The Ineffable in Nagarjuna and Plotinus" by Justin K. Ellis, provides a detailed comparison of ineffability in the philosophies of Nagarjuna and Plotinus. Here's a breakdown of the information related to your query:

*   **Definition of Ineffability:** The author defines ineffability as the "inability to describe something (with words or otherwise)."

*   **Ineffability in Plotinus:**
    *   **Cause of Ineffability:** For Plotinus, ineffability stems from the ultimate reality's (the One) simplicity. The One has no properties or predicates, which means nothing can be said about it. Any attempt to describe it would introduce plurality and violate its absolute unity.
    *   **Argument from Predication:** Because the One has no predicates, it cannot be described. For instance, it is not large, wise, or beautiful, and thus, nothing can be said about it.
    *   **Argument from Intellect:** The One cannot be known by the intellect because it is the cause of forms, and is not itself a form.
    *   **Reference:** *Enneads* V.5.6

*   **Ineffability in Nagarjuna:**
    *   **Key Concepts:** The author introduces the Buddhist doctrine of two truths (conventional and ultimate) and the concept of emptiness (*shunyata*), which is central to Nagarjuna's philosophy.
    *   **Emptiness (Sunyata):** Emptiness is described as the emptiness of *atman* (self) or *svabhava* (substance, essence, or inherent existence). It's the absence of inherent existence in all phenomena. Things exist conditionally (dependent origination), which means they lack *svabhava*.
    *   **Ineffability and Subject-Predicate Assertions:** The article states that with Nagarjuna, we cannot deploy our subject-predicate assertions because, from the ultimate point of view, there are no subjects to be predicated.
    *   **Emptiness and Nirvana:** The article quotes Nagarjuna's view that the difference between *samsara* (the cycle of rebirth) and *nirvana* is negligible.

*   **Comparison:**
    *   Both Plotinus and Nagarjuna see the ultimate reality as ineffable.
    *   The *reason* for ineffability is similar: the impossibility of predicating anything of the ultimate reality.
    *   However, the *identity* of the ultimate reality differs: Plotinus's ultimate reality is the transcendent One beyond being; Nagarjuna's is the world of interdependent causes and effects.

*   **Relevant Quotes:**
    *   *Diamond Sutra* quote about liberating beings.
    *   MMK 25.19: "There is not the slightest difference / Between samsara and nirvana. / There is not the slightest difference / Between nirvana and samsara."
    *   MMK 22.13-16 (regarding the Tathagata, the Buddha).

**Failure Scenarios Encountered:**
*   No failure scenarios were encountered. The content directly addressed the query and provided relevant information.

**Conclusion:** The web content is highly relevant and provides a good overview of ineffability in Nagarjuna's philosophy, along with a comparison to Plotinus. It also discusses the connection between *Sunyata* and the limits of predication.
