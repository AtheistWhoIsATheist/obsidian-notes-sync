    "summary": "Nagarjuna, often called \"the second Buddha,\" critiqued substantialist philosophies, emphasizing the concept of Śūnyatā (emptiness) to challenge assumptions about stable substances and fixed identities. This concept, meaning the lack of autonomous existence, highlights the interconnectedness and incessantly changing nature of phenomena, impacting Indian philosophical models of causation, epistemology, ethics, and salvation.",
