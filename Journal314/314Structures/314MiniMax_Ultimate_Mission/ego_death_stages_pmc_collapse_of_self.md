This web content is highly relevant to the query and provides a detailed overview of the "collapse of the self" concept and its therapeutic implications.

Here's a detailed extraction of the information:

**1. Definition of "Collapse of the Self":**

*   The phrase refers to self states where an individual's sense of self is reduced.
*   The sense of self is reduced to a particular set of largely implicit and automatic beliefs about self and others, and the behaviors that ordinarily express them.
*   During such states, the perception of self and others collapses into the minimal dimensions essential to the self state.
*   The full richness and complexity of self in everyday life are lost during the collapse.

**2. Examples of "Collapse of the Self":**

*   The angry “self-as-victim.”
*   The remorseful, redemption-seeking “self-as-offender.”

**3. Consequences of Collapse:**

*   Other persons in the individual's immediate relational world are susceptible to complementary forms of collapse. For example, a therapist's own sense of self may collapse into the "offender" who feels guilty and ineffectual in reaction to a "victimized" patient's plight.

**4. Therapeutic Restoration/Reintegration - Key Elements and Processes (Implied):**

*   **Imaginative empathy:** The author differentiates her concept of "imaginative empathy" from Kohut's "vicarious introspection."
*   **Therapist's Role:** The therapist, as the target of a patient's projection, is influenced by his or her own needs in relation to the patient. Yet the therapist can recover, discern what is happening, consider what his or her own role in the process has been, and then respond in a therapeutically useful manner.
*   **Courage and Confidence:** It requires the courage to “surrender” to the patient's unconscious demands on one's identity; the confidence that one can survive the storm.
*   **Harnessing the Storm:** The ability (of therapist and patient) to harness the energy of the storm's currents in the interest of the self-transformative process.
*   **Technical Limits:** Awareness of the psychoanalytic meaning of “therapist abstinence.”
*   **Modulation of Efforts:** Therapists also need to modulate their efforts to sustain attunement to patient needs with a considered awareness of the psychoanalytic meaning of “therapist abstinence.”

**5. Problematic Aspects of Therapy:**

*   **Reifying/Pathologizing:** When terms like “psychotic” are used too freely, they tend to pathologize patients in a manner that may sacrifice attunement.
*   **Overemphasizing or Underemphasizing Therapist Behavior:** Overemphasizing therapist’s expressions of self or underemphasizing "therapist abstinence" can be problematic.

**6. Reference to Related Concepts:**

*   Kohut's concept of "vicarious introspection."
*   Classical and object-relational facets of psychoanalytic theory.
*   Relational and intersubjective approaches.
