Here's an analysis of the provided web content, focusing on its relevance to the user's query:

**Relevance Assessment:**

The web content is **highly relevant** to the user's query. The article is titled "Nagarjuna – Sunyata" and directly addresses Nagarjuna's understanding of emptiness (Śūnyatā), its connection to dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda), and the idea of co-dependent arising, which includes emptiness itself.

**Detailed Data Extraction:**

Here's a breakdown of the information extracted, addressing the specific points of the user's query:

*   **Nagarjuna's Understanding of Śūnyatā (Emptiness):**

    *   **Definition:** Nagarjuna equates emptiness with dependent origination ("It is dependent origination that we call emptiness."). He argues that things are empty of *svabhava* (own-being or inherent existence). This is a core tenet of the Madhyamika school.
    *   **Meaning of *Svabhava*:** The article thoroughly explains *svabhava*, differentiating it into three understandings:
        *   *Essence-svabhava*: a property that an object cannot lose without ceasing to be that very thing.
        *   *Substance-svabhava*: something that does not depend on anything else.
        *   *Absolute svabhava*: the true or final nature of things.
    *   **Rejection of Inherent Existence:** Nagarjuna's primary argument is that dharmas (phenomena) lack *svabhava*, meaning they do not exist as independent substances. They are conceptual constructs.
    *   **Emptiness of Emptiness:** Nagarjuna's concept includes the idea that emptiness itself is empty; it is not a permanent, independent reality, but a process of self-emptying.
    *   **Cognitive Dimension:** The article highlights the cognitive dimension of *svabhava*, suggesting that it is a conceptual superimposition and a "cognitive default," something the mind unconsciously projects onto the world. Overcoming this is key.
*   **Connection to Dependent Origination (pratītyasamutpāda):**

    *   **Equivalence:** Nagarjuna directly links emptiness and dependent origination: "It is dependent origination that we call emptiness."
    *   **Co-dependent Arising:** The article explains that dependent origination means that all things, *including* emptiness itself, arise co-dependently and are products of conditions. This rejects the notion of independent, unchanging entities.
    *   **Rejection of Nihilism:** Nagarjuna's view of emptiness is presented as a middle way, rejecting both the idea that nothing exists and the idea that emptiness is a permanent, independent reality.
*   **Idea That All Things, Including Emptiness Itself, Arise Co-dependently:**

    *   **Key Principle:** The core of the article's explanation. The text emphasizes that all phenomena (dharmas), including emptiness, are conditioned and arise in dependence on other factors.
    *   **Rejecting Extremes:** This co-dependent arising is presented as a way to avoid two mistaken views: (1) the belief that nothing exists and (2) the belief that emptiness is a permanent, independently existing ultimate reality.
    *   **Practice:** The text suggests this is a lived experience, a process of self-emptying, and requires practice to overcome attachment to the idea of inherent existence.

**Additional Relevant Information from the Content:**

*   **Historical Context:** Briefly mentions Nagarjuna's life (c. 150-c. 250 CE) and his association with the Andhra region of India. Mentions his work *Mulamadhyamakakarika* (*Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way*) and commentaries by Candrakirti and Tsong kha pa.
*   **Scholarly Perspective:** Quotes from Jan Westerhoff and Paul Williams, providing scholarly interpretations of Nagarjuna's ideas.
*   **Terminology:** The text consistently uses key Buddhist terminology (*svabhava*, *anatman*, *dharmas*, *pratityasamutpada*, *sunyata*) and explains their meanings in the context of Nagarjuna's philosophy.
*   **Reference:** Provides a list of sources (books) at the end.

**Conclusion:**

The web content directly and thoroughly addresses the user's query. It provides clear explanations of Nagarjuna's understanding of emptiness, the relationship between emptiness and dependent origination, and the co-dependent arising of all things, including emptiness itself.
