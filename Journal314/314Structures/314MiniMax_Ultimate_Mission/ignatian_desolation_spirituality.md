**Margaret Silf's Lists (Characteristics of Desolation and Consolation):**

**Desolation:**

*   Turns us in on ourselves
*   Drives us down the spiral ever deeper into our own negative feelings
*   Cuts us off from community
*   Makes us want to give up on the things that used to be important to us
*   Takes over our whole consciousness and crowds out our distant vision
*   Covers up all our landmarks [the signs of our journey with God so far]
*   Drains us of energy

**Consolation:**

*   Directs our focus outside and beyond ourselves
*   Lifts our hearts so that we can see the joys and sorrows of other people
*   Bonds us more closely to our human community
*   Generates new inspiration and ideas
*   Restores balance and refreshes our inner vision
*   Shows us where God is active in our lives and where God is leading us
*   Releases new energy in us

**Response to States:**

*   **Desolation:** Change course (through prayer, community, discernment, spiritual direction).
*   **Consolation:** Stay the course.
