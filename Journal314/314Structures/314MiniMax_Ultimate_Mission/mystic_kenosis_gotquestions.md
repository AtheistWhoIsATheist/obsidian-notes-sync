**Relevance:** The content is **highly relevant** to the query. It directly addresses the definition of kenosis, its basis in Philippians 2:7, what it means for Jesus to empty Himself, common misunderstandings, and provides a summary of its theological significance.

**Data Extraction:**

*   **Definition of Kenosis:** The content defines kenosis as the doctrine of Christ's "self-emptying" in His incarnation.
*   **Biblical Basis (Philippians 2:7):** The passage in Philippians 2:7 ("emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men") is cited as the origin of the concept. The Greek word "kenoó," meaning "emptied," is the root of the term "kenosis."
*   **What it means for Jesus to empty Himself:**
    *   The content clarifies that Jesus did *not* empty Himself of His divine attributes.
    *   Instead, the "emptying" is better understood as a laying aside of the *privileges* He had in heaven.
    *   He "made himself nothing," gave up His divine privileges, and veiled His glory, taking the position of a servant.
    *   It was a self-renunciation and voluntary refraining from using His divinity to make His way easier.
*   **Common Misunderstandings:**
    *   The content warns against the "kenosis theory" (also referred to as "kenoticism" or "kenotic theology"), which suggests Jesus gave up all or some of His divine nature.
*   **Theological Significance (concerning Christ's divine and human natures):**
    *   The kenosis involved Christ taking on a human nature with its limitations, except for sin.
    *   Jesus remained fully God while also becoming fully human. He added a human nature to His divine nature.
    *   The passage highlights the humility involved in Christ becoming human and dying for humanity.

**Additional Details:**

*   The text provides examples of how Jesus operated within human limitations (e.g., getting tired, thirsty), while also demonstrating His divine attributes (e.g., displaying omniscience).
*   Reference is made to Colossians 2:9: "in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form.”
*   The content also mentions a quote from J.J. Müller, *The Epistles of Paul to the Philippians and to Philemon*, which describes that Christ remained "in the form of God" while also accepting the nature of a servant as part of His humanity.
*   The provided page also offers links to other articles related to Jesus Christ, including the hypostatic union, kenoticism, and the question of why Jesus called God "My God."
