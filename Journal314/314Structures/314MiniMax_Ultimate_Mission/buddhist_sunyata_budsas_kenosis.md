The web content is highly relevant to the user's query. It is an essay by Ven. Dr. Rewata Dhamma discussing "Sunyata, Emptiness, and Self-emptying, Kenosis" in the context of Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, and its relationship to the Christian concept of Kenosis.

Here's a detailed extraction:

**1. Overview of the Content:**

*   The essay compares and contrasts the Buddhist concept of *Śūnyatā* (emptiness) with the Christian concept of *Kenosis* (self-emptying).
*   It primarily focuses on the Mahayana understanding of *Śūnyatā*, contrasting it with Theravada interpretations.
*   The author examines the philosophical underpinnings of both concepts, drawing on the works of Nagarjuna and St. Paul, among others.

**2. Śūnyatā in Theravada Buddhism:**

*   **Definition:** In Theravada Buddhism, *Śūnyatā* is defined as the emptiness of self.
*   **Focus:** The emphasis is on understanding the truth of suffering and practicing to remove its origin.
*   **Ultimate Reality:** Nibbana, the ultimate truth, is realized through direct experience, which is beyond words and language.
*   **Approach:** Theravada suttas focus on practical methods to overcome suffering, avoiding philosophical speculation about the origins of the world or the existence of a creator God.

**3. Śūnyatā in Mahayana Buddhism:**

*   **Definition:** *Śūnyatā* is not nothingness but the truth or absolute reality of things or suchness (*tathata*) of the universe. It's not a being separate from beings nor a transcendent God separate from the world.
*   **Key Figure:** Nagarjuna, the founder of the *Madhyamika* school, is central to the Mahayana understanding of *Śūnyatā*. His philosophy, articulated in *Madyamika karika*, is the groundwork for this concept.
*   **Relation to *Prajnaparamita* and Dependent Origination:** Nagarjuna's teachings are considered an epitome of the *Prajnaparamita* sutras, and based on the law of dependent origination (*paticca-samuppada*).
*   **Nagarjuna's Philosophy:** *Śūnyatā* is not found outside or inside oneself, it is ultimate reality.

**4. Comparison with Kenosis:**

*   **Kenosis in Christianity:** The essay draws parallels between *Śūnyatā* and the Christian concept of *Kenosis*, particularly as expressed in Philippians 2:5-8. This passage describes Christ emptying himself.
*   **Mediation:** In Mahayana, the Buddha serves as a mediating principle between the absolute and phenomenal being, in a similar function to the mediator role in Christian theology.
*   **Difference between becoming a Buddha vs Christ:** The essay highlights a major difference: In Buddhism, one can become a Buddha through the realization of emptiness, whereas in Christianity, realization is participation in Christ's redemptive kenosis, but not becoming a Christ.
*   **Trikaya Theory:** The Mahayana concept of the *Trikaya* (Triple Body of the Buddha: *Dhammakaya*, *Sambhogakaya*, and *Nirmanakaya*) is presented as a framework to understand the different aspects of the Buddha, and how he embodies both the absolute (*Sunyata*) and the phenomenal.

**5. Key Concepts and Terminology:**

*   ***Buddha, Dhamma, Tathagata, Sunyata, Prajna:*** These are Buddhist terms. They do not have the same definition or meaning in Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism.
*   ***Prajnaparamita:*** (Perfection of Wisdom) a body of Mahayana Buddhist scriptures.
*   ***Paticca-samuppada:*** Dependent origination.
*   ***Tathata:*** Suchness or thusness, the ultimate reality.
*   ***Nibbana:*** The ultimate goal of Buddhism; the cessation of suffering.
*   ***Dhammakaya:*** The cosmical body of the Buddha, his essential nature, one with the Absolute.
*   ***Sambhogakaya:*** The body of bliss, the reflection of the cosmic body in the empirical world.
*   ***Nirmanakaya:*** The assumed body, the manifestation of the Buddha in the world.
*   ***Kenosis:*** The self-emptying of Christ.
