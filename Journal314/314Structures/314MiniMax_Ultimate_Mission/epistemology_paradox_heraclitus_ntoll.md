    "concept": "Unity of Opposites",
    "description": "Heraclitus's philosophical project explores the apparent paradox of the *unity of the universe* in the face of apparent *diversity and change*, with the eternal λόγος (logos) at its core.",
    "logos_role": "Logos means three things: the order (unity) underlying a universe of diversity and change, the capacity of a person to discern and make sense of such a situation (although very few people exercise this talent), and our ability to communicate our thoughts about such things with others. Each is a different facet of the eternal logos.",
    "unity_of_opposites_details": "By recognizing the interdependence and fitting together of things in opposition we glimpse a yet more fundamental and hidden unity. Heraclitus claims the unity of opposites is essential *for the existence of the different things in opposition*, for their mutual dependency unifies them.",
    "examples": [
      {
        "fragment": "What is in opposition is in agreement, and the most beautiful harmony comes out of things in conflict (and all happens[10] according to strife). (B8)",
        "explanation": "Change, in a universe of unity (i.e. *all things are one*), is caused by conflict and strife between opposites interacting via the common and universal. Change emerges in both the external and internal worlds. The logos is how we encounter, understand and express this state of affairs."
      },
      {
        "fragment": "Disease makes health sweet and good; hunger satiety, weariness repose. (B111)",
        "explanation": "This demonstrates that opposite conditions are essential for the experience of the other. Without disease, health would not be appreciated."
      },
       {
         "fragment": "(Even the potion[116] separates unless stirred). (B125)",
         "explanation": "Some things only exist because they arise from the strife of mixing or fitting together of different opposing parts, that would otherwise separate from each other. (Kukeon apparently behaved much like a modern-day vinaigrette.)"
       },
       {
         "fragment": "Cold things get warm; warm cools off; moist dries up; parched is wetted. (B126)",
         "explanation": "This fragment explicitly states the cyclical nature of change and the interplay between opposites."
       }
    ],
    "relation_to_logos": "The eternal logos consists of three aspects: the singularly unified universe full of diversity and change *that we encounter*, our cultivated and refined mental faculties *through which we understand* the universe, and our *skill at expressing* our shared feelings about, experiences and understanding of the universe with one another.",
    "fragment_examples_logos": [
      {
        "fragment": "Listening not to me but rather to the *logos* it is wise to agree[46] that all things are one. (B50)",
        "explanation": "A play upon the words *logos* and *homologein* = to agree."
      },
      {
        "fragment": "Seizures[11] —wholes and non-wholes, being combined and differentiated, in accord and dissonant: unity is from everything and from everything is unity. (B10)",
        "explanation": "Suggests the putting together and unification of diverse things. Cf. the discussion of *harmonia*."
      },
      {
        "fragment": "Thinking is common to all. (B113)",
        "explanation": "Commonality and universality are attributes that facilitate the eternal logos. Sharing aspects both in common and universally, explains how different things are able to correspond and coordinate with each other."
      },
       {
         "fragment": "For since everything comes to be according to this *logos*, they are like ignorant people when experiencing such words[3] and actions as I expound—when I describe each according to its nature[4], indicating how it is. (B1 - second sentence.)",
         "explanation": "The order of the universe is determined by the logos."
       }
    ],
    "hidden_harmony": "The hidden harmony is superior[53] to the visible. (B54) How does one become conscious of such hidden logos-related things?",
    "method_for_understanding": "Direct experience (over academic learning) and deep self reflection as complementary ways to perceive the eternal logos. The soul is a law that increases its own power. (B115). Direct experience and self-reflection — an immediate, lived and first-hand appreciation of the eternal logos — is how to encounter, understand, express and ultimately transcend the paradox of the *unity of the universe* in the face of apparent *diversity and change*.",
