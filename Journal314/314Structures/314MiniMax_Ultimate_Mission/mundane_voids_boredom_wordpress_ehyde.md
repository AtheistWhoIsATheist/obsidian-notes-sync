**Title:** Heidegger’s “Profound Boredom”: using boredom to cultivate the soul

**Author:** Eric Hyde

**Date:** June 19, 2021

**Summary:** The article explores Heidegger's concept of profound boredom and its potential for spiritual insight. It presents boredom as an encounter with existence stripped of distractions, which can lead to anxiety but also to attunement with Being.

**Key Concepts and Characteristics:**

*   **Profound Boredom:** A specific type of boredom described by Heidegger, which differs from simply "being bored with something" or "becoming bored with something." It is an experience of encountering existence without distractions.
*   **Encounter with Naked Existence:** Profound boredom provides an encounter with existence stripped of its typical distractions. This encounter can generate anxiety because it forces a confrontation with the "mystery" of being.
*   **Attunement to Being:** Hyde states that profound boredom, when approached correctly, can grant a person "attunement" to oneself and to existence as a whole, or more specifically, to *Being as a whole*. This is presented as a spiritual experience.
*   **Spiritual Ordering:** The experience of profound boredom can lead to a sense of calm wonder and spiritual ordering, rather than crushing the soul.

**Potential for Revealing Existence Stripped of Distractions:**

*   **The Article's Core Argument:** The central claim is that profound boredom can be a pathway to understanding existence, stripped of the usual distractions.
*   **Overcoming Anxiety:** It acknowledges that boredom can cause anxiety, leading people to cling to distractions. However, the article suggests that properly engaging with boredom can reveal truths about oneself and one's relationship to being.
*   **Guide to Peace and Mystery:** Profound boredom, if used properly, can be a guide to both peace and to the very mystery of being.

**Practical Application (as presented by Eric Hyde):**

1.  **Search Out Boredom:** Intentionally create space for boredom by turning off devices and finding an empty space. The article suggests experimenting with "being" rather than "doing," and using nature as a shortcut.
2.  **Allow Boredom's Message:** Observe the internal experience. Notice if anxiety, sadness, anger, frustration, or fear increase. Observe the body's reactions. The article suggests allowing the experience to unfold without interruption.
3.  **Repeat:** Continue this practice regularly to develop a familiarity with boredom, aiming to transform negative reactions into a place of rest. This is related to Taoist philosophy about creating a void.

**Additional Information/Context:**

*   **Heidegger's Original Work:** The article states that Heidegger investigated boredom in the early 20th century and discussed profound boredom in approximately 200 pages.
*   **Personal Reflection:** Hyde describes his own experience and understanding of the concept, drawing upon his experiences as a psychotherapist.
*   **Comparison:** The author references Pascal's quote about the cause of man's unhappiness being a lack of ability to be alone with oneself.
*   **Caveats:** The author acknowledges that the subject matter is dense and that the article only provides a basic overview. He also admits to running from boredom himself.
