The provided web content is an entry from the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy about Ludwig Wittgenstein. It contains a section dedicated to the *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*. This section is directly relevant to the user's query, as it discusses the *Tractatus*'s view on philosophical problems arising from misunderstandings of language logic, and how the book attempts to show this logic, touching upon the limits of language and the ineffable.

Here's the extracted information:

**Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus**

*   **Core Idea:** Philosophical problems arise from misunderstandings of the logic of language.
*   **Goal of the *Tractatus*:** To show what the logic of language is.
*   **Main Propositions:**  The text includes extracts of the *Tractatus* propositions that are highly relevant to the user's query such as:
    *   "4.003 Most of the propositions and questions of philosophers arise from our failure to understand the logic of our language...And it is not surprising that the deepest problems are in fact *not* problems at all."
    *   "5.6 *The limits of my language* mean the limits of my world."
    *   "4.1212 What *can* be shown, *cannot* be said."
*   **Picture Theory of Meaning:** The *Tractatus* proposes that propositions are meaningful insofar as they picture states of affairs or matters of empirical fact. This is presented as a prominent interpretation of the *Tractatus*.
*   **Nonsense and Philosophical Problems:** Wittgenstein suggests that many philosophical theories are attempts to answer questions that are not really questions at all. Philosophers have the task of presenting the logic of our language clearly, which will show that some things that we take to be important problems are really not problems at all.
*   **The Aim of the *Tractatus*:** To show up as nonsense the things that philosophers (including Wittgenstein himself) are tempted to say. It aims to dissolve philosophical problems by analysis rather than solving them by producing theories.
*   **Limits of Language and the Ineffable:** The text emphasizes the limits of what can be said, aligning with the query's focus on the ineffable.
