**2. Direct Relevance to Query and Information Extraction:**

The SEP entry provides substantial information relevant to the user's query:

*   **Concept of Nothing (Nichts):** While the entry doesn't have a specific section *dedicated* to "Nothing" (Nichts), it covers related concepts. Specifically:
    *   The SEP entry *does not* contain a specific section addressing Heidegger's concept of Nothing (Nichts).
*   **Significance in his Philosophy:** Although not directly discussed, related concepts such as "being" and "non-being" are relevant to the user's query on "nothing."
*   **Relation to Being:**
    *   The entry extensively discusses Heidegger's central question of "the meaning or sense of being."
    *   It covers "ontological pluralism," the distinction between being and entities, and the "truth-character of being," which are all vital to his understanding of being.
    *   The entry explores how time (temporality) is what allows us to make sense of being.
*   **Relation to Anxiety:**
    *   The entry discusses anxiety's role in disclosing how the entities we encounter "matter" to us.
    *   Anxiety is a breakdown in our everyday ability to engage meaningfully with the world.
    *   The experience of anxiety can lead to a deeper understanding of the structure of our existence.
*   **Relation to Metaphysics:**
    *   The entry provides an analysis of Heidegger’s view of metaphysics, including a discussion of the history of being.
    *   It outlines the four or five distinct epochs (Greek, Roman, Christendom, Modern, and Technological) and their relation to the history of being.
    *   It examines the dangers of the technological age.

**3. Extracted Data and Information:**

Here's a breakdown of extracted information, organized by the user's query elements:

*   **Heidegger's Philosophy in General:**
    *   Heidegger is a central figure in 20th-century European philosophy.
    *   His *magnum opus* is *Being and Time* (1927).
    *   His work influenced existentialism, phenomenology, hermeneutics, deconstruction, and post-structuralism.
    *   His work has also influenced movements like the Kyoto School in Japan and philosophers in North America.
    *   His analysis of human existence has inspired theorists in theology, anthropology, sociology, psychology, aesthetics, literary criticism, political science, strategic management, and cognitive science.
    *   The driving question in Heidegger’s work is “the question of being”—the question of the meaning or sense of being.
    *   Heidegger argued that our understanding of being is temporally structured.
    *   Heidegger held that there are multiple distinct *kinds* of being (ontological pluralism).
    *   Heidegger draws a distinction between being and entities, and thus between ontological inquiries and ontic sciences.
*   ***Being and Time*** **(Overview):**
    *   Heidegger’s declared aim in *Being and Time* is “the concrete working out of the question of the ‘meaning’ (*Sinn*) of ‘being’”.
    *   The fundamental subject of research in ontology … is temporality.
    *   *Being and Time* is a notoriously incomplete work.
*   **Being and Time: Temporality:**
    *   Heidegger’s (apparent) answer to the being-question is that *time* (or *temporality*) is what allows us to make sense of being—that time is “the possible horizon for any understanding whatsoever of being” (SZ 1).
    *   Heidegger intended to argue in *Being and Time* that only if and when “temporality temporalizes itself” “can entities manifest themselves as entities” (GA26: 274/211–2).
    *   Heidegger identifies several different types of temporality.
        *   Temporality with an upper-case ‘T’ (*Temporalität*)—time as “the condition of the possibility of the understanding of being and of ontology as such” (GA24: 324);
        *   temporality with a lower-case ‘t’ (*Zeitlichkeit*)—Dasein’s temporal structure, in virtue of which we are simultaneously ahead-of-ourselves, already-being-in (a world) and being-amidst (entities encountered in the world) (SZ 327);
        *   “world-time”—“the time within which worldly events and natural processes in the narrower sense fall” (GA21: 248);
        *   “the ordinary understanding of time”—also known as “now-time”, or time understood as a flowing stream of now-moments. (SZ 330–1);
        *   “the traditional [or philosophical] time concept”—time as a neutral container of changes, measured out by now-moments, which moments are dimensionless points used to demarcate and count change.
*   **Being and Time: Authenticity and Anxiety:**
    *   Authenticity involves the “anticipation of death”.
    *   Anticipation of death “individualizes Dasein down to itself”.
    *   Anxiety is the mood in which I experience immediately the finitude of my future horizon of possibilities.
*   **Being and Time: Reality:**
    *   Heidegger argues that philosophical debates between realists and idealists exhibit a deep confusion that results from a failure to distinguish between different kinds of being (in particular, between the occurrent, the available, and Dasein).
    *   Heidegger distinguishes four questions that pick out different issues in the general problem of the reality of the external world.
    *   Q4: Is reality dependent on us—that is, on Dasein’s understanding of being?
        *   Heidegger argues that “entities are independent of the experience, familiarity, and grasping through which they are disclosed, discovered, and determined” by us (SZ 183).
*   **Being and Time: Truth:**
    *   There are two aspects to Heidegger’s account of truth; we might call these *the Historical Thesis* and *the Thematic Thesis* respectively.
    *   *The Historical Thesis* holds that early Greek thinkers like Parmenides and Heraclitus understood truth as unconcealment—that is, as bringing things out of concealment into the open.
    *   *The Thematic Thesis* holds that (regardless of the way that the early Greeks understood truth) the structure of truth in general is best understood as unconcealment. Heidegger identifies at least four different kinds of truth that participate in the logic of unconcealment:
        *   (1) *Propositional truth*: an assertion or belief is true when it “points out” or uncovers an entity in a state of affairs. (see SZ 218; GA21: 112–3)
        *   (2) *Ontic truth*: an entity is uncovered *as* what it is on the basis of our having well-articulated practices for encountering it—that is, it can show up as what it is because we know how to cope with it, have the right dispositions for using and responding to it, and so on.
        *   (3) *Ontological truth*: “Ontological truth is the primordial truth about entities, because it discloses in advance what is essential about the being of entities”. (GA25: 193)
        *   (4) *Truth as clearing*, i.e., the unconcealment of historical worlds or historical understandings of being (e.g., the medieval Christian style of being, the modern style of being, the technological style of being). (See, e.g., GA65: 422–3; Sikka 2021)
    *   Heidegger understands propositional truth as uncovering, he departs in an important respect from many prominent theories of propositional truth. While preserving the idea that assertions get it right about how things are, he rejects theories of correspondence which understand correspondence as a relationship that obtains between a mental representation and a state of affairs.
*   **Heidegger's Later Thought and the History of Being:**
    *   Heidegger writes of a “turn” (*Kehre*) that, as Braver explains, refers either to “a reversal of perspective, turning from Dasein’s being to being itself”, or to “a fundamental change in being’s relation to us” (Braver 2021: 783).
    *   After the turn, Heidegger is increasingly interested in tracing out the succession of different styles or understandings of being that make up a history of being.
    *   The history of being is a history of fundamental changes in the way entities manifest themselves.
    *   There are three main periods to consider in Heidegger’s account of the history of being:
        *   The first period is the pre-metaphysical world of the pre-Socratic Greeks.
        *   The second period begins with the transition to metaphysics in the “thinking of Plato and Aristotle”.
        *   The third and future period will only arise with the overcoming of metaphysics and an “other beginning” of history—a beginning that must necessarily take the form of a retrieval of paths of thought that were incipient already in the first beginning, but not taken (see, e.g., GA65: 504;
        *   Supplement: Heidegger and the Other Beginning).
    *   Each metaphysical world has a coherent background sensibility for what makes sense, what goals are worth pursuing, how entities are organized, how actions are justified, what things are certain, and what things are open to doubt.
    *   The primary feature of a metaphysic, then, is the existence of a *uniform ontological style*.
    *   Heidegger identifies several characteristics of a metaphysical doctrine.
        *   *priority of entities over being*
        *   “beingness is understood as constant presence”
        *   *oblivion to emergence*
        *   *cognitivism*
    *   Heidegger argues that the history of the West from Plato to the present has been punctuated by a sequence of four or five distinct epochs, each with its own overarching ontological style. These include the Greek, the Roman, Christendom, the Modern, and the Technological epoch.
*   **Technology:**
    *   Heidegger regards the technological mode of revealing entities as “the supreme danger” to humanity (GA7: 31 / QCT 26).
    *   The *mood* of the technological age is a mood of profound boredom.
    *   Heidegger’s name for the basic ontological *characteristic* of entities (including us humans) in the technological age is *Bestand*, often translated as “resource” but perhaps best translated as “stock”—as when we speak of the “stock” of replaceable parts that are held in an inventory.
    *   Resources or stock pieces are gathered or organized, as a unified *whole*, in what Heidegger calls *das Gestell*.
*   **Overcoming Metaphysics:**
    *   Much of Heidegger’s later work is concerned with envisioning pathways toward overcoming metaphysics.
    *   Heidegger identifies four dimensions of the local place that sustains human poetic dwelling. He refers to these four dimensions collectively as “the fourfold”. They include the *earth*, the *sky*, *mortals*, and the *divinities*.
*   **Heidegger’s relationship with the Nazi Party:**
    *   Heidegger was a member of the Nazi party until the end of the Nazi regime.
    *   The significance for Heidegger’s philosophy of his reprehensible engagement with National Socialism, as well as his now well-documented anti-Semitism, is hotly disputed.
