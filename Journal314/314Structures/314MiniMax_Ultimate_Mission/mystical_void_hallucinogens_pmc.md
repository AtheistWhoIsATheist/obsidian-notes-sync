The web content is highly relevant to the query. It is a scientific article titled "Classic Hallucinogens and Mystical Experiences: Phenomenology and Neural Correlates" published in the journal "Curr Top Behav Neurosci."

Here's a detailed extraction of information about "{Extract descriptions of mystical experiences involving the 'void' or contentless unity, and their phenomenological characteristics, particularly in relation to classic hallucinogens.}":

**1. Definitions and Descriptions of Mystical Experiences**

*   **Definition (Watts, 1970):** Mystical experiences are "those peculiar states of consciousness in which the individual discovers himself to be one continuous process with God, with the Universe, with the Ground of Being, or whatever name he may use by cultural conditioning or personal preference for the ultimate and eternal reality".
*   **Key Feature: Sense of Unity:** A critical definitional feature is a sense of unity, or the experience of becoming one with all that exists.
    *   **Extrovertive Mystical Experience:** Involves recognition of the oneness of all, finding unity at the core of the inner subjectivity or inner reality of all things despite the diversity or apparent individual identity and separation of all things.
    *   **Introvertive Mystical Experience:** Involves an experience of the complete dissolution of the self, loss of the notion of "I" and loss of all boundaries, such that there is no separation or individual identity. This experience of unity is otherwise devoid of content, sometimes referred to as "the void". Stace considered extrovertive unity as an "incomplete kind of experience which finds its completion and fulfillment in the introvertive kind of experience” (Stace, 1960a).
*   **Other Dimensions (Stace, 1960b):**
    1.  *Sacredness*: a sense that what is encountered is holy or sacred.
    2.  *Noetic quality*: the experience is imbued with an aspect of meaning and a sense of encountering ultimate reality that is more real than usual everyday reality.
    3.  *Deeply felt positive mood*: joy, ecstasy, blessedness, peace, tenderness, gentleness, tranquility, awe.
    4.  *Ineffability*: the experience is difficult to put into words.
    5.  *Paradoxicality*: to explain the experience, one seems to have to describe the co-existence of mutually exclusive states or concepts.
    6.  *Transcendence of time and space*: Introvertive mystical experiences may have a non-spatial and non-temporal aspect, such that the traditional notions of time and space have no meaning.
*   **Example of a Psilocybin-Induced Mystical Experience (Johns Hopkins study):**
    >   “In my mind’s eye, I felt myself instinctively taking on the posture of prayer in my head. I was on my knees, hands clasped in front of me and I bowed to this force. I wasn’t scared or threatened in any way. It was more about **reverence**. I was showing my respect. I was humbled and honored to be in this presence. This presence was a feeling, not something I saw or heard. I only felt it, but it felt **more real than any reality I have experienced**. And it was a familiar place too. One I had felt before. It was when I surrendered to this, that I felt like I let go. I was gone…or I should say this earthly part of me was. It was still on the couch in some sort of suspended animation awaiting my return. I was **in the void**. This void had a **strange and indescribable quality to it** in that there was nothing to it but this feeling of **unconditional and undying Love**. It felt like my soul was basking in the feeling of this space. I have no idea how long this lasted. **Time and space did not exist there** …it was all different manifestations of this Love feeling I found myself wrapped in.”

**2. Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ)**

*   **MEQ43 (Pahnke-Richards Mystical Experience Questionnaire):** The 43-item version, scored into seven scales based on seven descriptive dimensions of mystical experience described by Stace (1960): internal unity, external unity, noetic quality, sacredness, positive mood, transcendence of time and space, and a final factor that combined ineffability and paradoxicality scores.
*   **MEQ30 (Revised 30-item MEQ):** A psychometrically-validated retrospective measure of mystical experience. The 4 factors of the psychometrically validated questionnaire are derived from a total of 30 items that probe 7 dimensions (designated by underlines) of mystical experience that were identified by Stace (1960).
    1.  *Mystical* (including items from the previously proposed internal unity, external unity, noetic quality, and sacredness factors).
    2.  *Positive mood*.
    3.  *Transcendence of time and space*.
    4.  *Ineffability*.
*   The MEQ30 and the Hood Mysticism Scale are psychometrically validated measures of mystical experience that have been derived from the same conceptual frame (Stace, 1960a), but they differ in specific items and underlying factor structure. The MEQ30 and the Hood Mysticism Scale also differ in the timeframe over which the dimensions of mystical experiences are assessed. The MEQ30 assesses phenomena occurring during a single discrete experience, while the Hood Mysticism Scale typically assesses phenomena occurring over a lifetime. In addition, the MEQ30 has only been used in studies of classic hallucinogens (Griffiths et al., 2006; Griffiths et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2014; Garcia-Romeu et al., 2015), whereas the Hood Mysticism Scale has been used most often in the context of survey research, in which the etiology of mystical experience is unknown, but generally not assumed to be due to classic hallucinogens.

**3. Classic Hallucinogens and Mystical Experiences**

*   **Historical Context:** The ingestion of naturally occurring classic hallucinogens in ceremonial contexts has a long history, with evidence of use dating back thousands of years. Peyote, ayahuasca, and psilocybin mushrooms are highlighted as examples.
*   **Psilocybin Studies:**
    *   **Pahnke's Good Friday Experiment (1962):** Administered psilocybin to seminary students.
        *   30-40% of participants in the psilocybin condition achieved a complete mystical experience, whereas none of the control participants who received nicotinic acid achieved a complete mystical experience (Pahnke, 1967).
        *   Limitations:  Limited generality due to the highly selective demographics of the participants (seminary students), conduct of the study in a group setting that allowed interactions among participants, explicit instructions to participants that some would and some would not receive psilocybin (thus creating powerful expectancy effects), and the fact that half of the researchers present during the study also received psilocybin.
    *   **Griffiths et al. (2006, 2008, 2011) Studies:** Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with psilocybin.
        *   Showed psilocybin can occasion complete mystical experiences in the majority of people studied. These effects are dose-dependent and specific to psilocybin.
        *   **Griffiths et al. (2006):** 61% of participants had "complete mystical experiences" during psilocybin sessions (compared to 11% with methylphenidate).
        *   **Griffiths et al. (2008):** 67% of participants rated their psilocybin session as among the top five most spiritually significant experiences of their lives. Mystical experience score on session days predicts ratings of spiritual significance at 14 months.
        *   **Griffiths et al. (2011):** Dose-related effects of psilocybin on mystical experience. 61% of participants met criteria for a "complete" mystical experience during the 20 mg/70 kg session, whereas 67% of participants met criteria for a "complete mystical experience during the 30 mg/70 kg session. Overall, 72% of volunteers had a “complete” mystical experience during the 20 mg/70kg session and/or the 30 mg/70 kg session (using MEQ30 scoring).

**4. Neural Correlates**

*   **Default Mode Network (DMN):** The medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) are major nodes of the medial aspect of the DMN.  These areas are involved in self-referential processing.
    *   **Medial DMN:** Alterations in the MPFC, PCC, and PHC after classic hallucinogens and during meditation are thought to be consistent with decreases in self-referential processing.
        *   Classic hallucinogens (e.g., psilocybin) have been shown to decrease activity and connectivity in these brain regions, which is associated with the intensity of drug effects and a decreased sense of self ("ego-dissolution").
        *   The decreased activity within the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate which is observed after psilocybin and during meditation is consistent with decreased self-referential processing that accompanies introvertive mystical experience.
    *   **Lateral DMN:** The inferior parietal lobule (IPL), specifically the angular gyrus, is implicated in spatial and temporal processing.  Changes in this area are linked to the experience of timelessness and spacelessness in mystical experiences.
        *   Decreased activity in the IPL (and specifically in the angular gyrus), and decreased communication between the IPL and other areas involved in maintaining a sense of self (such as the PCC) is observed both in studies of meditation and in studies of classic hallucinogens.
*   **Neural Model Hypotheses:**
    1.  Activity within the medial nodes of the DMN will decrease, and communication between these nodes and other cortical targets in associative and sensory processing cortex will be fundamentally altered, in support of decreased self-referential processing during introvertive mystical experiences.
    2.  Activity within the lateral nodes of the DMN will decrease, and communication between these nodes and other cortical targets will be fundamentally altered, in support of the experience of timelessness and spacelessness experienced during introvertive mystical experiences.
    3.  Long-distance cortical communication will generally decrease, while local sensory and associative processing is maintained to some degree, during mystical experiences.
    4.  "Small-world" properties of the brain will decrease during mystical experiences.
