Here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information about the Daoist "wu" as a nothingness pregnant with being, its characteristics, and its difference from absolute nothingness, based on the provided text:

**Explanation of Daoist "Wu"**

*   **Wu (無) as "Nothingness":** The article focuses on the Taoist idea of "Wu" (無), often translated as "Nothingness," "Emptiness," or "Non-Existence." It emphasizes that understanding "Wu" requires a deeper examination beyond a purely intellectual concept. The idea is not just a philosophical idea but related to the practice of living and how it affects our life existentially.

*   **Wu in Relation to "Being":** The text references the Taoist perspective that "everything under the sky comes from being and being comes from nothingness" (天下萬物生於有. 有生於無). However, it emphasizes that the relationship between "being" and "nothingness" is not a logical or cosmological concept, but it is intimately related to the practice of living under certain very specific conditions and should not be viewed as merely intellectual concepts.

*   **Wu in Relation to "Wu Wei" (無為) or "Doing Nothing":** According to the text, the concept of "Wu" is closely related to "Wu Wei" (無為), often translated as "non-action" or "doing nothing." "Wu Wei" gains its meaning when considered alongside "Yau Wei" (有為) or "doing something." The concept of "Wu Wei" can be understood only as the other pole of "Yau Wei." "Wu" negates "wei".

*   **Context of "Wu" in Historical and Cultural Conditions:** The text provides context, mentioning that Laotzu developed these ideas during a time of societal decay and the decline of the Chou Dynasty. During the time of the Warring Nations, there was a sudden blooming of many different schools of Chinese philosophy and a flurry of fresh ideas at that time, because the thinkers of the period all had to figure out how to deal with this decay. The old forms of culture had become artificial, hypocritical, and restrictive, therefore Laotzu developed the idea of "*wu wei"* to alleviate and to relieve the people from such suffering.

*   **Characteristics of "Wu":**
    *   *Naturalness and Authenticity*: It is connected with returning to naturalness.
    *   *Freedom from Restrictions*: It advocates liberation from artificial cultural forms and is seen as the ideological weapon for such liberation.
    *   *State of Mind*: It is a state of mind, a mental state, not merely about the material world or the natural world of science.
    *   *Practices*: The Taoists advocate two practices to attain the state of "Wu": "*Hsu"(* 虛) (or detachment/emptying/abandonment/abolition) and silence. We must strive for the ultimate emptying of our mind from concepts so that it remains uncluttered and open. We must strive to keep to our pristine serenity, peace and quiet which was originally ours. We must silence our desires and even our thoughts.

*   **"Wu" as "Nothingness Pregnant with Being":** The text indicates that Taoist "wu" is not absolute nothingness, but rather "a nothingness pregnant with being, a better form of being!"

*   **"Wu" in practice:** The concept of "wu" is not an absolute "nothingness". It is a nothingness pregnant with being, a better form of being! The concept of "wu" really refers to a state, not something concrete. The Taoists are more concerned with "how" things and processes occur.
