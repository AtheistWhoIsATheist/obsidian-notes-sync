**Detailed Extraction of Information:**

**1. Etymology and Definition:**

*   **Definition:** Kenosis (Ancient Greek: κένωσις, *kénōsis*) means "the act of emptying."
*   **Origin:** The word comes from the Greek verb *kenóō* (κενόω), meaning "to empty out."
*   **Liddell–Scott Greek–English Lexicon definitions:**
    *   emptying, depletion, emptiness (of life)
    *   depletion, low diet, as opposed to *plerosis*, fullness
    *   waning (of the moon)

**2. New Testament Usage:**

*   **Key Verse:** Philippians 2:7 is considered the most significant verse for the Christian idea of kenosis: "[Jesus] emptied himself" (*ekenōsen heauton*).
*   **Verb Form:** The verb *kenóō* occurs five times in the New Testament (Romans 4:14; 1 Corinthians 1:17, 9:15; 2 Corinthians 9:3; Philippians 2:7).
*   **Philippians 2:5-9 (NRSV):** "Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited, but **emptied himself** (*ekenōsen heauton*), taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness. And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death—even death on a cross. Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name..."

**3. Christology:**

*   **Kenotic Christology:** This interpretation uses Philippians 2 to explain the human side of Jesus' existence.
    *   It suggests that Jesus, despite being divine, voluntarily humbled himself to live a human experience.
    *   Jesus emptied himself, allowing him to experience human limitations.
    *   Key theologians associated with kenotic Christology are Gottfried Thomasius, P. T. Forsyth, H. R. Mackintosh, Charles Gore, Fisher Humphreys, Donald G. Dawe, and Roger E. Olson.

*   **Eastern Orthodoxy:**
    *   Emphasis on following Christ's example.
    *   *Kenosis* is linked to humility and seeking union with God.
    *   Relates to both Christology and Pneumatology (Holy Spirit).
    *   *Kenosis* involves the continual self-denial of one's human will.
    *   In Christ, *kenosis* is a condescension and self-sacrifice for humanity's redemption.
    *   Emphasis on *theosis* (becoming holy by grace).
    *   Distinguishes between divine Essence and Energies. *Kenosis* unites a person with God.
    *   *Kenosis* is a component of dispassionation (detaching from the world).

*   **Catholicism:**
    *   Pope Pius XII condemned a particular interpretation of Philippians regarding *kenosis* in his 1951 *Sempiternus Rex Christus*. He stated, "This is called the kenotic doctrine, and according to it, they imagine that the divinity was taken away from the Word in Christ."
    *   John of the Cross used the concept of *kenosis* to explain "self-emptying" and becoming receptive to God's will. This is used to explain the Incarnation and to indicate the nature of God's activity and will.
    *   John of the Cross's "Dark Night of the Soul" is mentioned as a lucid explanation of the believer's transformation.

*   **Unitarianism:**
    *   Interpretations of Philippians 2:7 and *kenosis* vary, but start from the view that Christ "emptied" himself during his life, not before birth.
    *   Different views on when this emptying occurred (crucifixion, Garden of Gethsemane, continual process).
    *   Cited: Thomas Belsham, Joseph Priestley, and Tom Barling

*   **Gnosticism:**
    *   The equivalent to *kenosis* is Christ's withdrawal of his own luminosity so as to cease dazzling his own disciples.
    *   Mention of the *Pistis Sophia* text.

**4. Kenotic Ethic:**

*   The kenotic ethic interprets Philippians 2:7 as a call for Christians to be subservient to others, mirroring Jesus' humility.
