The web content is highly relevant. It is an entry from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on "Mysticism," which directly addresses the user's query about epistemological aspects of mystical experiences, particularly apophatic claims and the understanding of mystical experiences as knowledge.

Here's a detailed extraction of information, focusing on the user's request:

**Focus: Epistemological Aspects of Mystical Experience, Apophatic Claims, and Knowledge**

**1. Mystical Experiences (Section 1)**

*   **Definition:** The entry provides a definition of "mystical experience" in a narrow sense and a more inclusive definition. The narrow sense focuses on *unitive* experiences, excluding sensory input and involving a subject's awareness of realities not accessible through senses or standard introspection. The inclusive definition expands this to include both sensory and non-sensory awareness that grants acquaintance of realities or states of affairs not accessible via ordinary perception.
*   **Key Terms Explained:** The definitions clarifies "Purportedly", "Nonsensory awareness," "Nonstructured sensory experience," "Acquaintance," and "States of affairs."
*   **Knowledge by Participation/Identity:** The definition highlights that "acquaintance" in mystical experiences implies a "knowledge by participation" or "knowledge by identity."
*   **Examples:** The entry mentions experiences like "union with God," the realization of identity with a higher being (e.g., Brahman), and the experience of oneness with nature.
*   **Exclusion:** The definition excludes paranormal experiences like visions, voices, and out-of-body experiences, because they are dualistic experiences.
*   **Enduring States:** The entry emphasizes that mystics value achieving enduring states of consciousness over transient experiences and that mysticism is a matter of practices and ways of life, not episodic experiences.
*   **Distinction from Religious Experience:** It differentiates "mystical experience" from "religious experience," with the latter being a broader category.

**2. Classifying Mystical Experiences (Section 2)**

*   **Dichotomies:** The section classifies mystical experiences through various dichotomies, including:

    *   **Extrovertive and Introvertive (2.1):**
        *   **Extrovertive:** Experiences that include sense-perception. Examples include consciousness of the unity of nature.
        *   **Introvertive:** Experiences without sense-perception. Examples include experience of “nothingness” and awareness of God lacking sense-experiences.
    *   **Dualistic and Monistic (2.2):**
        *   **Dualistic:** Experiences that maintain a distinction between the subject and what is disclosed (e.g., theistic experiences).
        *   **Monistic:** Experiences that dissolve all duality. This includes experiences of absolute ontological oneness and pure consciousness experiences.
    *   **Apophatic and Kataphatic Mysticism (2.4):** This is highly relevant to the query.
        *   **Apophatic:** Mystics claim that nothing positive can be said about objects or states of affairs they experience. These are absolutely indescribable, or "ineffable." Thus, apophatic theology typically will be negative theology—that we can say only what God is not. Examples include Shankara’s Advaita Vedanta and Plotinus.
        *   **Kataphatic:** Mystics make claims about what they experience, describing it in positive terms. This applies to descriptions of God using positive terms.

**3. Attributes of Mystical Experience (Section 3)**

*   **Noetic Quality (3.1):** Mystical experiences are alleged to be "noetic," meaning they impart knowledge. This section cites James's view that mystical experiences give knowledge of what a subject apprehends. This section defines noetic quality as "a strong sense of gaining a genuine and unmediated insight, or of encountering ultimate reality; the mystical experience, by definition, is felt to be ‘more real than real’".
*   **Ineffability (3.2):**
    *   **Core Idea:** Mystical experiences are often described as ineffable, meaning they cannot be fully expressed in language. The entry explores the implications and various interpretations of ineffability.
    *   **Challenges:** The entry highlights a logical problem: stating that something is ineffable implies saying *something* about it, which contradicts ineffability.
    *   **Responses to the Problem:** The entry presents several solutions to the problem of ineffability:
        *   Silence.
        *   Distinguishing first-order and second-order attributions.
        *   Saying that “*X* is ineffable” is really a statement about the *term* “*X*,” saying about it that it fails to refer to any describable entity.
        *   The ongoing negation of whatever is said about *X* *ad infinitum* in an infinite “unsaying.”
        *   Referring to the difficulty of describing in literal terms rather than by metaphor, analogy, and symbols.
        *   Considering "ineffability" as an honorific title marking the value and intensity of an experience.
        *   Invoking ineffability is not to describe but to prescribe that no language shall be applicable.
    *   **Impact:** It also mentions that some philosophers see ineffability as an attempt to consign mysticism to the irrational or the emotions, and others defend the rationality of mysticism.
*   **Paradoxicality (3.3):** The entry discusses how mystical experiences are sometimes described as paradoxical, defining the term and giving different senses of "paradoxical." The section goes on to explain that "paradox" in mystical discourse is natural, because mystics want to affirm something of the nature of what they experienced, but they must utilize language originally designed for phenomenal realities and so must then deny the ascriptions as not actually applicable.

**4. Pure Consciousness Events (Section 4)**

*   **PCEs:** The entry discusses the possibility of "pure consciousness events" (PCEs), where the subject "empties out" all phenomenological qualities and content, yet remains awake.
*   **Defenders and Deniers:** It presents arguments for and against the occurrence and significance of PCEs.
*   **Arguments:**

    *   Defenders of PCEs cite references to pure consciousness in mystical literature.
    *   Critics offer counterarguments, including:
        *   Idealization in reports.
        *   "Emptying out" only refers to emptying ordinary content, not all content.
        *   Repression or nebulous conceptual events during the experience.
        *   The intentionality of consciousness (always consciousness *of* something).
*   **Centrality in Mysticism:** The entry questions the centrality of PCEs in theistic mysticism, where the goal is often to align oneself with reality or God, not necessarily to experience complete emptiness.

**5. Essentialism (Section 5)**

*   **Essentialists:** Claim that there is a "common core" to all mystical experiences, independent of culture.

**6. Perennialism (Section 6)**

*   **Perennialists:** Claim that there are universal mystical doctrines about what is allegedly experienced that transcend all cultures and religions—a common core of esoteric doctrines that are expressed differently in different religions and cultures.

**7. Constructivism (Section 7)**

*   **Constructivists:** Assert the conceptual "construction" of mystical experiences by cultural influences.
*   **Soft vs. Hard Constructivism:**
    *   **Soft Constructivism:** No mystical experiences without some structuring from the mystic’s culture.
    *   **Hard Constructivism:** A mystic’s specific cultural background completely determines the alleged cognitive content of all mystical experiences.
*   **Arguments Against PCEs (Soft Constructivist Arguments):**
    *   Impossibility due to the nature of humans.
    *   Distinguishing experience from an event.
    *   Mystical experiences always have conceptual content.
    *   Subjects could not know they underwent a PCE if truly empty.
    *   Problems with the relationship of PCEs to subsequent claims of knowledge.
    *   PCEs could not have an impact on a mystic’s life if contentless.
*   **Criticism of Soft Constructivism:**
    *   Pre-conceptual experiences are possible.
    *   The distinction between experience and event is not important.
    *   Neuropsychological studies support PCEs.
    *   Reliabilist and evidentialist accounts of knowledge.
    *   Defenders of PCEs can champion their epistemological significance.
*   **Hard Constructivism's Main Argument:**
    *   **Premise A:** The conceptual scheme a mystic possesses completely determines the nature and content of the mystical experience.
    *   **Premise B:** Mystics from different mystical traditions possess pervasively different conceptual schemes.
    *   **Conclusion:** Therefore, there cannot be a common experience across cultural traditions (essentialism is false).
*   **Criticism of Hard Constructivism:**
    *   "Thin" descriptions may be possible, allowing for common experiences.
    *   Expressions of surprise and heretical outcomes challenge the view.
    *   The valuable commonality of experiences despite conceptual disparity.
    *   Cultural conditioning does not influence everyone in the same way.
    *   Disciplines aimed at loosening one's conceptual scheme.
    *   Differing mystical understandings of the same religious text.
    *   Overemphasis on pre-mystical religious teaching.

**8. Inherentists and Attributionists (Section 8)**

*   **Inherentists:** Believe that there are experiences that are inherently religious or mystical.
*   **Attributionists:** Believe that there are no inherently religious or mystical experiences.

**9. Epistemology (Section 9)**

*   **Key Question:** Does mystical experience provide evidence for the truth of mystical claims?
*   **Two Main Approaches:**
    *   **Doxastic Practice Approach (9.1):** The Doxastic Practice Approach argues that the justification of every doxastic practice is “epistemically circular”—i.e., its reliability cannot be established in any way independent of the practice itself. This includes sense-perception practice. William Alston defends the beliefs that people form from their mystical and numinous experiences, specifically of a theistic kind, based on their "doxastic practice.”
    *   **The Argument from Experience (9.2):**
        *   Experiences of God have a subject/object structure with a phenomenological content.
        *   Such experiences count as at least some evidence.
        *   Agreement between experiences enhances the evidence.
        *   Consequences in the life of the experiencer can further enhance validity.
*   **Disanalogies to Sense-Experience (9.3):** Arguments are made against both the Doxastic Practice Approach and the Argument from Experience by way of alleged disanalogies between experiences of God and sense-perception, including:
    *   Lack of checkability.
    *   God’s lack of space-time coordinates.
*   **Evaluation of the Disanalogy Arguments (9.4):** The entry discusses the problems with the disanalogy arguments.
*   **The Argument from Experience as Dependent on the Doxastic Practice Approach (9.5):** This section argues that the Argument from Experience might have to yield to the Doxastic Practice Approach.
*   **The Problem of Religious Diversity (9.6):** This section addresses the problem of conflicting claims from different religious traditions.
*   **Scientific Studies: Meditation and Psychedelics (9.7):** The entry discusses scientific research into meditation and psychedelics, and the philosophical questions they raise.
*   **A Critique of Naturalist Explanations (9.8):** The entry presents arguments against reducing mystical experiences to natural causes. The section gives a critique of naturalistic explanations.
*   **Evaluation of Neuropsychological Explanations (9.8.1):** This evaluates what neurosciences may, and may not, explain in mystical experiences.
*   **The Claimed Superiority of Naturalist Explanation (9.8.2):** Some philosophers believe that naturalist explanations are superior, and should be adopted.

**11. Mysticism and Morality (Section 11)**

*   **Relationship to Morality:**
    *   Some scholars believe mystical experiences are the source of moral behavior.
    *   Others argue that some mystical doctrines are incompatible with morality.
    *   Others maintain that there is no intrinsic connection between mystical experience and moral behavior.
