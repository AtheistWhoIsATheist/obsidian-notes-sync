**Extracted Information:**

**1. Typologies of Mysticism:**

*   **Early Studies:**
    *   Lay scholars of the 19th and 20th centuries investigated mystical experiences, categorizing them into types.
    *   Examples: William James (*The Varieties of Religious Experience*, 1902), Edward Carpenter, Richard Bucke, Romain Rolland, Rudolf Otto, Friedrich von Hügel, Evelyn Underhill, Aldous Huxley (*The Perennial Philosophy*, 1945).
*   **R. C. Zaehner – Natural and Religious Mysticism:**
    *   Distinguishes three types:
        *   **Theistic Mysticism:** Includes Jewish, Christian, Islamic mysticism, and some Hindu examples.
        *   **Monistic Mysticism:** Based on the experience of unity of the soul, including early Buddhism and Hindu schools (Samkhya, Advaita Vedanta).
        *   **Natural Mysticism:** Experience of nature being one, including Zen Buddhism, Taoism, American Transcendentalism.
    *   Zaehner considers theistic mysticism superior due to its moral imperative.
    *   Zaehner's views have been criticized for imposing a theological framework on non-theistic traditions.
*   **Walter T. Stace – Extrovertive and Introvertive Mysticism:**
    *   Argues that doctrinal differences shouldn't be used for cross-cultural comparison of mystical experiences.
    *   Focuses on common characteristics of mystical experiences and separates perception from interpretation.
    *   Distinguishes two types:
        *   **Extrovertive Mysticism:** Unity within the world.
        *   **Introvertive Mysticism:** Unity devoid of perceptual objects; experience of "no-thing-ness".
    *   Table of Common Characteristics (as presented in the article):
        *   **Extrovertive:**
            1.  The Unifying Vision - all things are One
            2.  The more concrete apprehension of the One as an inner subjectivity, or life, in all things
            3.  Sense of objectivity or reality
            4.  Blessedness, peace, etc.
            5.  Feeling of the holy, sacred, or divine
            6.  Paradoxicality
            7.  Alleged by mystics to be ineffable
        *   **Introvertive:**
            1.  The Unitary Consciousness; the One, the Void; pure consciousness
            2.  Nonspatial, nontemporal
            3.  Sense of objectivity or reality
            4.  Blessedness, peace, etc.
            5.  Feeling of the holy, sacred, or divine
            6.  Paradoxicality
            7.  Alleged by mystics to be ineffable
    *   Stace argues that extrovertive experiences are on a lower level than introvertive experiences.
    *   Criticisms: Lack of methodological rigor, perennialist pre-assumptions, and the validity of claims that mysticism offers valid knowledge.

**2. Mystical Experience:**

*   Defined as a subjective experience interpreted within a religious framework.
*   Originated in the 19th century as a defense against rationalism.
*   Influenced by Perennial philosophy, Transcendentalism, Universalism, Theosophical Society, New Thought, Neo-Vedanta, and Buddhist modernism.
*   **William James:**
    *   Popularized "religious experience" in *The Varieties of Religious Experience*.
    *   Viewed mysticism as a distinctive experience providing knowledge of the transcendental.
    *   Four Qualities of Mystical Experiences:
        1.  Ineffability (defies expression)
        2.  Noetic quality (insight into truth)
        3.  Transiency (short duration, lasting effect)
        4.  Passivity (passive recipient, not an active seeker)
    *   Recognized conflicting doctrines but believed in a mystical unanimity.
    *   Separated the mystic's experience from theological claims.
    *   Emphasized "feeling" as central to religion, ignoring theology, ritual, and historicity.
*   **Inducement of Mystical Experience:**
    *   Distinction between trance (inhibited consciousness) and reverie (interpretation needed).
    *   Means of Inducement:
        *   Spontaneous
        *   Religious practices (contemplation, meditation)
        *   Entheogens (drugs)
        *   Neurophysiological origins
*   **Criticism of the term mystical experience:**
    *   Western-centric concept, introduces a false duality.
    *   Experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.
    *   Fails to distinguish between episodic experience and the process of mysticism.
    *   Can exclude social justice and focus on individual inner states.

**3. Perennialism, Constructionism, and Contextualism:**

*   **Perennialism:**
    *   Various mystical traditions point to a universal transcendental reality.
    *   Mystical experiences are privatized and separated from context.
    *   William James was highly influential in popularizing this approach.
    *   Essentialist model: experience is the same across all contexts.
    *   Common core-thesis.
    *   Principal exponents: James, Stace, Huston Smith, Ralph W. Hood.
*   **Constructionism:**
    *   Mystical experiences are shaped by ideas, symbols, and practices.
    *   Experiences are fully constructed.
    *   Principal exponent: Steven T. Katz.
    *   Katz: No pure, unmediated experiences; interpretations are shaped by cultural and religious backgrounds.
*   **Contextualism:**
    *   Considers historical and cultural context.
    *   Also includes constructionism and attribution theory.
    *   Neurological research provides an empirical approach.
*   **Steven Katz's Constructionism:**
    *   Criticizes Stace's typology and notion of unmediated experience.
    *   Argues that experience and interpretation are inseparable, and the latter is always mediated.
    *   Highlights the role of conceptual frameworks in shaping experience.
*   **Robert Forman - pure consciousness event:**
    *   Criticizes Katz
    *   Argues that mystical experiences involve a new awareness that cannot be described in existing frameworks.
    *   Neurological evidence for pure consciousness event.
*   **Richard Jones:**
    *   Believes the perennialism vs. constructionism debate is ill-formed.
    *   Constructivism is the nature of *mystical experiences* while perennialism is a matter of *mystical traditions and the doctrines they espouse*.

**4. Neurological Research:**

*   Focuses on identifying the neurological bases and triggers of mystical experiences.
*   Relates mystical experiences to neurological processes.
*   **Temporal Lobe:**
    *   Associated with the feeling of "I" and familiarity/strangeness.
    *   Linked to mystical experiences and personality changes.
    *   Links to epilepsy and religious experience.
*   **Anterior Insula:**
    *   Related to the feeling of ineffability and subjective certainty.
    *   Dysfunction may cause the experience of emotional confidence.
*   **Parietal Lobe:**
    *   "Orientation association area" (OAA) activity reduced during meditation, leading to a perceived lack of physical boundaries. (Newberg & d'Aquili)
*   **Default mode network:**
    *   Relevance of the default mode network in spiritual and self-transcending experiences.

**5. Validation and Assessment:**

*   The article does not provide specific *methods* or *criteria* for validating mystical experiences.
*   Stace's work implies that the common characteristics of mystical experiences, in both of his typologies, could be used in a way to validate that a certain experience has a common element across cultures, but this is not directly stated.
*   Hood's "Mysticism Scale" is mentioned, which aims to measure the experience based on Stace's model.

**Failure Scenarios:**

*   No failures encountered. The content is directly related to the query and provides detailed information.
