The web content is relevant and contains information about the Sufi concepts of *fanāʾ* (annihilation of the self) and *baqāʾ* (subsistence in God) as a paradoxical process, and how these relate to the understanding of divine reality.

Here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information:

**Overview:**

The article discusses *fanāʾ* and *baqāʾ* as central concepts in Sufism, exploring their etymology, literal meanings, and Sufi interpretations. It positions them as stages or states of spiritual development.

**Fanāʾ (Annihilation):**

*   **Etymology and Literal Meaning:**
    *   *Fanāʾ* (فَنَاء) in Arabic means annihilation, evanescence, extinction, and perishment.
    *   Related to Aramaic *pānyā* and Ottoman Turkish *fenâ* (vanity, perishment, nothingness).
    *   Root: *f-n-y* (ف ن ي‎) – associated with words like *fānin* (evanescent, transitory) and *ʔafnā* (to destroy, annihilate).
    *   Maltese *fena* means “to exhaust” and “to tire out”, particularly in a spiritual manner.
*   **Interpretations:**
    *   **Death before Death:** The complete annihilation of the ego and self-control.
    *   **Annihilation in the Presence of God:** Recognizing oneself as an instrument in the Divine Plan.
    *   **Unionist Approach:** A breakdown of the individual ego and the realization of unity between God, creation, and the individual self. This approach is considered heretical by some.
*   **Quranic Basis:**
    *   Reference to Surah Ar-Rahman, Verse 26-27: "All things in creation suffer annihilation and there remains the face of the Lord in its majesty and bounty."
    *   Implications of "every *nafs* that exists will suffer death" (Quran 3:185).
*   **Further Understanding of *Fana*:**
    *   **Annihilation of the lower self:** The passing away of the attributes of the lower self (nafs) and the passing away of the repugnance to, and reliance upon, anything that may happen.
    *   **Abandonment of the individual self:** Replacing it solely with the contemplation of Allah.
        *   It combines with the knowledge of certainty (*ilm al-yaqin*), leading to the vision of certainty (*ayn al-yaqin*), and then to **Ma’rifa** (gnosis).
        *   From here one can finally reach the reality of certainty (*haqq al-yaqin*).
        *   This stage is what Al-Ghazali called *fana’ kulli* and *fana fi al-tawhid*, and recognizes Allah as the sole agent of the universe.
        *   This stage does not imply fusion, identification, or incarnation.
    *   **Unionist Approach**
        *   Examples:
            *   "*When the Shaykh (Halláj) said ‘I am God’ and carried it through (to the end), he throttled (vanquished) all the blind (sceptics). When a man’s ‘I’ is negated (and eliminated) from existence, then what remains? Consider, O denier.*"
            *   Rumi's Masnavi poem describing the transformation from mineral to plant, animal to man, and ultimately to a state beyond the imagination.

**Baqāʾ (Subsistence):**

*   **Etymology and Literal Meaning:**
    *   *Baqāʾ* (بَقَاء) means remaining, lasting, enduring, perpetual existence, duration, survival, and continuance.
    *   Root: *b-q-y* (ب ق ي‎).
    *   *Baqiya* (بَقِيَ) means “to last”, “to endure”, “to stay”, and “to remain”.
    *   In South Levantine Arabic it exists as *biʔi* (بقي) meaning “to stay” and “to remain”.
    *   Ottoman Turkish, Persian, and Turkish all have words with a similar meaning as *baqāʾ*.
    *   Malay *baka* derived from the original Arabic baqaa, {and} which means eternal.
*   **Sufi Concept:**
    *   Living "with Allah, through Allah, in Allah, and for Allah".
    *   The state that comes *after fanāʾ*.
    *   The second step and the great *manzil* or destination.
    *   Preparedness for constant remembrance and living for Allah and the constant vision of the Divine.
    *   The highest stage where one retains self-awareness and is constantly aware of the Divine.

**Relationship between Fanāʾ and Baqāʾ:**

*   They are seen as sequential "stations" (*maqāmāt*), "waystations" (*manāzil*), "fields" (*maydān*), and "states" (*aḥwāl*) of the human being.
*   *Fanāʾ* is the annihilation of the individual self, and *baqāʾ* is the self that appears afterward.
*   *Baqāʾ* is the state of Divine Eternity.
