*   **Title:** Thermal Noise as a Window into the Quantum Vacuum: Spatial Patterns Revealed by Simple Experiments
*   **Authors:** Sun-Hyun Youn
*   **Abstract:** We show that the spatial structure of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations, predicted by quantum electrodynamics, can be indirectly observed using thermal noise at radio frequencies. Using simple lab equipment like coaxial cables and RF splitters, we detect a clear suppression of thermal noise near conducting boundaries, mirroring the expected modulation of vacuum modes. This provides accessible, experimental evidence for quantum vacuum behavior without requiring advanced optics or cryogenics.

**Relevance to the query:**

The content is highly relevant as it directly addresses the quantum vacuum and vacuum fluctuations in the context of experimental observation. The paper discusses how thermal noise can be used to investigate the spatial structure of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. It relates the quantum vacuum behavior to observable phenomena using accessible experimental setups. However, it does not appear to discuss "the Abyss" directly.
