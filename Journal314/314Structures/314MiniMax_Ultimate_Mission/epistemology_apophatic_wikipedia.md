**Extracted Information:**

**1. Etymology and Definition:**

*   **Definition:** Apophatic theology is a form of theological thinking and religious practice that attempts to approach God by negation. It focuses on what cannot be said about God.
*   **Alternative Name:** Negative theology.
*   **Origin of "Apophatic":** From the Greek word "apophēmi," meaning "to deny."
*   **Via Negativa:** The Latin term for the "negative way" or "by way of denial."
*   **Comparison:** It's contrasted with cataphatic theology (affirmative theology), which describes God through positive statements.

**2. Origins and Development:**

*   **Early Roots:** Elements of apophatic theology can be found in Plato's unwritten doctrines, Neo-Platonic, Gnostic, and early Christian writers.
*   **Key Developments:**
    *   The fusion of Jewish tradition with Platonic philosophy (Philo of Alexandria).
    *   The works of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, who infused Christian thought with Neo-Platonic ideas.
*   **Influence:** Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo.
*   **Central Figure:** Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Maximus the Confessor, whose writings shaped Hesychasm and Western mysticism.

**3. Historical Context and Key Figures:**

*   **Greek Philosophy:**
    *   **Pre-Socratic:** Xenophanes noted limitations in human knowledge of divine forms. Homer and Hesiod's works were used to explore the relationship between humanity and the divine. Parmenides's distinction between "Being" and "opinion" influenced the apophatic tradition.
    *   **Plato:** Plato, specifically his Theory of Forms (Truth, Beauty, and Goodness), influenced the development of apophatic thought. The Allegory of the Cave illustrates the human limitations in understanding the "Form of the Good." However, Plato himself cannot be regarded as the founder of the negative way.
    *   **Middle Platonism:** God as the first principle. Philo emphasized God's transcendence.
    *   **Neo-Platonism:** The first principle became even more elevated as a radical unity, which was presented as an unknowable Absolute.
        *   **Plotinus:**  The founder of Neo-Platonism.  For Plotinus, the *One* is the first principle, and "is beyond Mind and indeed beyond Being."  The *One* is radically simple and beyond self-knowledge.  Plotinus advocated for a search for the Absolute through "taking away" or abstraction, culminating in a sudden appearance of the *One.* Method for henosis - philosophy and negative theology.
        *   **Proclus:**  Introduced terminology used in apophatic and cataphatic theology. He presented them as a pair, with the apophatic approach corresponding to the manifestation of the world from the One, and cataphatic theology corresponding to the return to the One.
*   **Christianity:**
    *   **Early Church Fathers:** Influenced by Philo. Clement of Alexandria held that God is unknowable, though not in his energies. Tertullian stated that our incapacity to grasp God gives us an idea of what he is. Cyril of Jerusalem stated that to confess our ignorance in what concerns God is the best knowledge. Augustine defined God as "other, completely other," and stated that "if you understand, it is not God."
    *   **The Chalcedonian Christological dogma:** Formulated by the Fourth Ecumenical Council, it emphasizes that God remains transcendent to mankind's rational categories.
    *   **Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite:** Combined Christian and Neo-Platonic ideas. Described the human ascent to divinity as purgation, illumination, and union.
    *   **Eastern Orthodox Christianity:** Apophatic theology is taught as superior to cataphatic theology. Gregory of Nyssa, John Chrysostom, and Basil the Great emphasized the importance of negative theology. John of Damascus wrote that positive statements reveal "not the nature, but the things around the nature." Maximus the Confessor had a strong influence on the theology and contemplative practices of the Eastern Orthodox Churches. Gregory Palamas formulated the theology of Hesychasm, contemplative prayer, and theosis ("deification"). Vladimir Lossky argued that positive theology is always inferior to negative theology.
    *   **Western Christianity:** 9th-century theologian John Scotus Erigena wrote that God cannot be said to exist in the way creation does. Meister Eckhart and John of the Cross exemplified aspects of the apophatic tradition. The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) stated "between Creator and creature no similitude can be expressed without implying an even greater dissimilitude."
        *   ***Via Eminentiae:*** Thomas Aquinas's interpretation of the above-mentioned declaration, which overthrew its meaning, inaugurating the "analogical way" as a *tertium* between *via negativa* and *via positiva*.
    *   **20th Century:** Kierkegaard, Rudolf Otto, Karl Barth, Ludwig Wittgenstein (Tractatus), and Martin Heidegger. C.S. Lewis advocated for the use of negative theology to cleanse the mind of misconceptions. Herman Dooyeweerd provided a philosophical foundation for understanding the impossibility of absolutely knowing God and yet the possibility of truly knowing something of God. Ivan Illich can be read as an apophatic theologian.
    *   **21st Century:** Karen Armstrong notes a recovery of apophatic theology in postmodern theology.
        *   William Franke argues that literature and philosophy begin to bleed into one another as they approach what he frames as the "apophatic" side of Western thought.

*   **Islam:**
    *   *Ta'tīl* ('setting aside', 'canceling out', 'negation', or 'nullification').
    *   Mu'tazili school of Kalam were often called the *Mu'aṭṭilah* ('cancelers' or 'negators').
    *   Rajab ʿAlī Tabrīzī affirmed the completely unknowable and attributeless nature of God.
    *   Shia Islam largely adopts "negative theology."
    *   Literalists reject negation.
    *   Ash'aris and Maturidis adhere to a middle path between negation and anthropomorphism.

*   **Judaism:**
    *   **Maimonides:** The most influential medieval Jewish exponent of the *via negativa*. He emphasized that God is unlike anything else and thus indescribable. He saw his essence, being, and knowledge as completely one.
    *   **Yeshayahu Leibowitz:** A prominent modern exponent of Jewish negative theology.
    *   **Jacques Derrida:** His work, particularly deconstruction, has been compared to negative theology. Derrida argued the aims of negative theology - to demonstrate the ultimate, incomprehensible, transcendent reality of God- are a form of ontotheology which runs fundamentally counter to deconstruction's aim of purging Western thought of its pervasive metaphysics of presence.

*   **Indian Parallels:**
    *   **Upanishads:** Described Brahman as "neti neti" or "neither this, nor that."
    *   **Brahma Sutras:** State, "Whenever we deny something unreal, it is in reference to something real."
    *   **Buddhist Philosophy:** Emphasized the way of negation, including anatta (not-atman, not-self).
    *   **Shankara:** Holds that the transcendent noumenon, Brahman, is realized by the means of negation of every phenomenon including language.
    *   **Bhartṛhari:** Language has both phenomenal and noumenal dimensions, the latter of which manifests Brahman.
    *   **Advaita:** Brahman is Nirguna (without qualities).

*   **Baháʼí Faith:**
    *   God is ultimately unknowable.
    *   Emphasis on the Manifestation of God as a reflection of God's reality.

**4. Apophatic Theology and Atheism:**

*   Apophatic theology is sometimes accused of being a form of atheism or agnosticism because it cannot definitively say that God exists. However, it is argued that *via negativa* requires negation of correlative atheisms to maintain integrity.

**5. Methods:**

*   Approaching God through negation, focusing on what God is *not*.
*   Abstraction: "taking away" (Plotinus).
*   Emphasis on the unknowability and transcendence of God.
*   Contemplation and mysticism (often aligned with apophatic theology).
