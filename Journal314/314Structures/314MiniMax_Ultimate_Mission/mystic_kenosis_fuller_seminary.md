The provided web content contains a relevant article titled "The Self-Emptying of Christ" which directly addresses the user's query.

Here's a detailed extraction of the information:

**Concept of Kenosis:**

*   The article focuses on the concept of *kenosis* (self-emptying) as described in Philippians 2:5-11, a passage central to understanding Christian humility.
*   It explains that *kenosis* comes from the Greek word for "emptying."
*   The text examines how Jesus, "being in the form of God, emptied himself, taking the form of a slave." This is understood not as a divestment of deity but as an expression of it. Jesus was able to take on human form because he *is* God.

**Theological Meaning:**

*   The theological meaning of *kenosis* is explored in the context of the incarnation. Jesus, though divine, humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death.
*   The article emphasizes that the self-emptying is not a loss of divinity but a way God expresses his nature, taking on the existence of a creature while remaining God.
*   The article references that the humility described in Philippians 2:8 is not a display of a "loser." It is an understanding of the way of Christ.

**Implications for Christian Leadership and Humility:**

*   The article suggests that *kenosis* provides a key to understanding how Christians are called to exercise leadership with humility.
*   It draws a parallel between how Jesus, in his deity, could function as humanity and how Christian leaders should humbly serve.
*   Christian leadership, the article argues, should function in solidarity with humanity, utilizing resources to serve others, listen, pray, network and speak the grace of God.
*   The article references that the leaders should avoid actions of those who seek "grasping" or "exploitation" of others.
*   The author uses Philippians 2:1-6 from *The Message* translation to emphasize the importance of humility and service in Christian leadership: "Don't push your way to the front; don't sweet-talk your way to the top. Put yourself aside, and help others get ahead. Don't be obsessed with getting your own advantage. Forget yourselves long enough to lend a helping hand."

**Additional Information:**

*   The article also touches upon how Paul's letter to the Philippians acknowledges suffering within the church. Paul commends the "mind of Christ" to the Philippians as a way to handle distress.
*   The text references the "mind of Christ," which involves joy, humility, and obedience, as defining each other.
*   Several sources are cited, including commentaries by D.A. Carson and Peter O'Brien, and the work of N.T. Wright.
