**Śūnyatā (Emptiness) - Key Aspects Related to the Query:**

*   **Definition:** Śūnyatā, most often translated as "emptiness," "voidness," or "vacuity," is an Indian philosophical concept. In Buddhism, it has multiple meanings depending on the doctrinal context; it can be an ontological feature of reality, a meditative state, or a phenomenological analysis of experience.
*   **Early Buddhism:**
    *   **Pāli Nikāyas:** The Pāli Canon uses "śūnyatā" in three ways: as a meditative dwelling; as an attribute of objects; and as a type of awareness-release.
    *   **Emptiness as a Meditative State:** This state is reached when "not attending to any themes, he [the bhikkhu] enters & remains in internal emptiness". (MN 122). This is achieved through the "four formless states" of meditation and then through "themeless concentration of awareness."
    *   **Cūlasuññata-sutta (MN III 104) and the Mahāsuññata-sutta (MN III 109)**: These suttas outline a step-by-step mental cultivation process to "dwell in emptiness." Both stress the importance of impermanence and the absence of a self.
    *   **Kāmabhu Sutta (S IV.293)**: Describes a trancelike contemplation where perception and feeling cease, followed by three types of "contact" (*phasso*): emptiness (*suññato*), "signless" (*animitto*), and "undirected" (*appa*ṇ*ihito*).
    *   **Meaning of Emptiness:** Explained in M I.297 and S IV.296-97 as "emancipation of the mind by emptiness" (*suññatā cetovimutti*).
*   **Mahāyāna Buddhism:**
    *   **Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras:** Teach that all entities, including *dharmas*, are empty of self, essential core, or intrinsic nature (*svabhava*). Wisdom (prajña) is a non-conceptual understanding of emptiness. These sūtras use metaphors like "illusions" (*māyā*) and "dreams" (*svapna*).
    *   **Heart Sutra:** A key Prajñāpāramitā text, directly states that the five skandhas (along with the five senses, the mind, and the four noble truths) are "empty" (*sunya*).
    *   **Madhyamaka School:** Focused on the analysis of emptiness, and known as *śūnyatavāda*. Founded by Nāgārjuna, who used *reductio* arguments to show the non-substantiality of everything. Equated emptiness with dependent origination.
        *   *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (MMK)*: Nāgārjuna's main work.
        *   Nāgārjuna's interpretation: things have the nature of lacking true existence or own being (*niḥsvabhāva*), all things are mere conceptual constructs (*prajñaptimatra*).
        *   The realization of emptiness is key to liberation.
        *   Nāgārjuna argued his philosophy was not a view and did not take any position or thesis.
    *   **Yogācāra School:** Explains emptiness in terms of the three natures theory. Emptiness is the "absence of duality between perceiving subject (lit. "grasper", Skt: *grāhaka,* Tib: *'dzin-pa*) and the perceived object ("grasped", Skt: *grāhya,* Tib: *bzhung-ba*)." In Yogācāra, the subject and object are empty.
    *   **Buddha-nature:** *Tathāgatagarbha* or Buddha-nature texts suggest that all sentient beings contain a *Tathāgata* as their essence. The Buddha-nature transcends emptiness.
    *   **Tibetan Buddhism:** Emptiness is mainly interpreted through Mādhyamaka philosophy, with influence from Yogacara and Tathāgatagarbha.
        *   Distinction between autonomist (*svātantrika*) and consequentialist (*prāsaṅgika*) approaches.
        *   *Shentong* ("other empty") and *Rangtong* ("self-empty") views.

**Relevant Terminology:**

*   *Anatta/Anātman*: No-self.
*   *Svabhava*: Intrinsic nature.
*   *Dharma*: Phenomena, things.
*   *Samadhi*: Meditative absorption
*   *Satori*: Not directly mentioned, but the content speaks of the relationship between emptiness and meditative states which lead to enlightenment
*   *Māyā*: Illusion.
*   *Pratītyasamutpāda*: Dependent origination.

**Comparison to Non-Conceptual Understanding:**

*   The text directly links *śūnyatā* to a non-conceptual understanding through the concept of wisdom (*prajña*), which is a deep, non-conceptual understanding of emptiness, as presented in the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras.

**Note:** The article provides comprehensive information on the query's focus, particularly how Śūnyatā relates to meditation (samadhi), and the nature of reality it points to. It includes mentions of non-conceptual understanding through the idea of *prajña* and the emphasis on seeing the emptiness of phenomena.
