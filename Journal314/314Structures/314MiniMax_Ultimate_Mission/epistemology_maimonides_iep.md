Relevant sections of the article include:

*   **4. Some Fundamental Metaphysical and Epistemological Issues:** This section directly addresses Maimonides' negative theology. It discusses how Maimonides believed that God's nature is beyond human comprehension and can only be understood through negations. The article also explores the limitations of human knowledge in grasping the divine essence, emphasizing the use of equivocal language when speaking of God.
*   **5. Maimonides on the Limits of Knowledge:** This section further complements the discussion on negative theology by elaborating on Maimonides' views on the limits of demonstrative knowledge, particularly in relation to astronomy and the creation of the world.

Here's a detailed extraction of information related to the query, "{Extract information on Maimonides' negative theology, specifically how he argues God's attributes can only be understood through negation.}":

**Negative Theology and Understanding God's Attributes:**

*   **Core Concept:** Maimonides' negative theology posits that God's nature is so transcendent that it's impossible to comprehend it positively. Therefore, the only way to understand God is through negations.
*   **Method:** We can only describe God by what God is *not*. This approach avoids anthropomorphism and misrepresenting the divine simplicity.
*   **Attributes of Action vs. Attributes of Essence:** Maimonides distinguishes between attributes of God's actions (e.g., gracious, powerful, merciful) and attributes of God's essence. The former can be discussed based on the effects of divine activity in the world, but the latter is beyond human grasp.
    *   "Every attribute that is found in the books of the deity…is therefore an attribute of His action and not an attribute of His essence." (*Guide of the Perplexed*, I, 53, p. 121)
*   **Equivocal Language:** Language used to describe God is equivocal, meaning it doesn't have the same meaning as when used to describe created entities. Terms like "knowledge," "justice," and "benevolence" don't have the same meaning when applied to God.
*   **Limitations of Human Intellect:** Maimonides believed human intellect is inherently deficient in its ability to fully comprehend God. This is because of the perfection of God's existence and the limitations of human intellects.
    *   "It has also become clear in metaphysics that by our intellects we are unable to attain perfect comprehension of His existence, may He be exalted. This is due to the perfection of His existence and the deficiency of our intellects. His existence has no causes by which He could be known" (Maimonides, “Eight Chapters,” in *Ethical Writings of Maimonides*, Ch. VIII, pp. 94-5).
*   **Silence and Negation:** In attempting to describe God, language fails, and we are, in effect, silenced, thus relying on negation as the basis for our understanding of the divine. We can't know what God *is*, but what God is *not*.
*   **Scriptural Language:** The article mentions how Maimonides addressed the use of descriptive language in Scripture (e.g., God is forgiving, merciful, angry). He maintained that such language is meant to convey truths to those with less sophisticated understanding ("the language of the children of Man"). The philosopher can interpret this language in a way that aligns with metaphysical meaning.
*   **Example of Negation:** The example provided illustrates that when we use negative theology, such as saying God is not weak, we are not placing God in a category, rather, God is understood *not* to be limited by the categories of weak or strong.
    *   "God falls under no description" (Seeskin, p.88).
*   **Positive Knowledge through Effects:** We can know that God exists, is a unity, and is eternal. Moreover, even though we cannot comprehend divine activity, we can understand the effects of divine activity in the created order.
