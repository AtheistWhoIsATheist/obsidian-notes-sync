    *   The Buddha used "void," "no rising and falling," "calmness," and "extinction" to explain Śūnyatā and cessation.
    *   Śūnyatā is of positive and substantial significance.

*   **Contemplating the Implications of Sunyata and Stillness (Nirvana) by Observing Worldly Phenomena:**
    *   All existences exhibit void-nature and nirvana-nature.
    *   We realize the truth by observing our worldly existence.
    *   Three paths to observation:
        *   Observe the preceding and current states of conditions (time).
        *   Observe existences according to their interrelationships (space).
        *   Observe the true nature of all myriad beings.
    *   By observing the preceding-stage and the current-stage conditions, we verify the Law of Impermanence.
    *   Impermanence implies existences do not have a permanent entity; another implication of the nature of sunyata and stillness.
    *   From observations of existence via inter-relationships, we conclude that nothing is independent of the Law of Causation and that everything is without ego.
    *   From the observation of all existences, we can infer the theory of nirvana and the complete cessation of all phenomena.
*   **Sunyata and Cessation is the Truth (Nature) of All Existences:**
    *   All existences are misunderstood; we cling to them as real.
    *   "Unreal name" means "assumption" or "hypothesis."
    *   Everything exists relatively.
    *   Śūnyatā is the fundamental characteristic and reality of all existence.
    *   In the Sutras and Abhidharma, worldly understandings are referred to as phenomena (Dharma).
    *   Śūnyatā is referred to as Dharma-nature.
    *   We can analyze the "existence" and "nature (voidness)" from two aspects:
        *   The truth of sunyata is the nature of each individual existence.
        *   Dharma-nature is best described as the characteristic of equanimity of sunyata.
*   **The Relationship between Phenomena and the Sunyata of Dharma-nature:**
