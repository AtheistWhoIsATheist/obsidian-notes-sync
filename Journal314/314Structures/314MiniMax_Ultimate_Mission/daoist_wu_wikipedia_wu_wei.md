**Detailed Extraction of Information:**

The following information has been extracted from the Wikipedia article, focusing on the user's request for the Daoist concept of emptiness (wu, non-being) and its relationship to *wu wei*:

*   **Definition of *Wu Wei***: "Wu wei (traditional Chinese: 無為; simplified Chinese: 无为; pinyin: *wúwéi*) is a polysemous, ancient Chinese concept expressing an ideal practice of "inaction", "inexertion" or "effortless action," as a state of personal harmony and free-flowing, spontaneous creative manifestation."
*   **Early Scholarship:** The article discusses how Herrlee G. Creel took wu wei as denoting two different things:
    1.  An "attitude of genuine non-action, motivated by a lack of desire to participate in human affairs" which aligns closely with the contemplative Daoism of the *Zhuangzi*.
    2.  A "technique by means of which the one who practices it may gain enhanced control of human affairs." Creel suggested Daoists may have adopted the second idea of wu wei from Shen Buhai.
*   **Daoist Development:** The article references Laozi's emphasis on returning to the "primordial Mother" and becoming like "uncarved wood". *Wu wei* in practice is achieved through behavior modification and practices such as meditation and breathing techniques.
*   **Concept of *Shén***: The article refers to the concept of *shén* ('numen', 'numinous') attained through relaxed efforts:
    *   "There is a numen [*shén*]; naturally residing within; One moment it goes, the next it comes, And no one is able to conceive of it."
*   **Relationship to *Dao***: *Wu wei* is described as aligning with the natural *Dao* to avoid force or haste against the natural order.
*   **Influence of *Daodejing***: The *Daodejing* likely written after the early *Zhuangzi*, *wu wei* becomes a major "guiding principle for social and political pursuit" in which the Daoist "seeks to use his power to control and govern the world".
