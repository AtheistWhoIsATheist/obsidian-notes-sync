The web content from MasterClass provides information about ego death, including its stages, characteristics, and causes.

Here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information:

**What Is Ego Death?**

*   Ego death is an experience where an individual loses their sense of self.
*   It can be cultivated through deep awareness, often experienced during meditation or psychedelic states.
*   Some perceive it as encountering their true selves, while others believe it signifies the absence of a traditional self.
*   The concept is rooted in spiritual practices like Buddhism, Sufism, Christian mysticism, and Taoism.
*   The term was popularized by Timothy Leary in "The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead."

**What Causes Ego Death?**

*   **Near-death experiences:** A close brush with physical death can lead to ego death, often accompanied by feelings of unity and peace.
*   **Psychedelic substances:** Drugs like ayahuasca, DMT, LSD, ketamine, psilocybin (magic mushrooms), and others can trigger ego death at high doses. The content explicitly states that these substances come with the risk of negative side effects.
*   **Spiritual practice:** Practices like meditation, prayer, and other spiritual disciplines can lead to ego death, often associated with spiritual awakening.

**How Ego Death Works**

*   It involves short-circuiting aspects of the brain's default mode network.
*   Chemicals such as glutamate and dimethyltryptamine (DMT) may influence this process.

**3 Stages of Ego Death**

1.  **Dissolution:** An altered state of consciousness, often induced by meditation or psychedelic drugs. This stage can involve dreamlike imagery and a feeling of losing one's grip on reality.
2.  **Ego loss:** A complete loss of subjective identity, a sense of unity with the fabric of reality, which can feel like Nirvana or enlightenment.
3.  **Return to everyday life:** The individual returns to routine reality but may approach it with a new perspective. The experience can have lasting effects, both positive and negative.

**What Does Ego Death Feel Like?**

*   It can feel like liberation and enlightenment.
*   It can also be disruptive to mental health.
*   Some believe it offers a glimpse into one's true nature, while others see it as a state of drug-induced psychosis.
*   The experience leaves a lasting impact.
