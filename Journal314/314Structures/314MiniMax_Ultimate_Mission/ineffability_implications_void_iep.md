The web content is highly relevant to the query. It is a comprehensive article on "The Metaphysics of Nothing" and discusses various arguments on why nothingness or the void is considered ineffable, and the implications of this for describing it.

Here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information:

**Key Arguments and Implications:**

*   **Ineffability as a consequence of trying to describe Nothing:** The article explains that attempts to describe nothingness often lead to self-contradiction. By trying to define or describe "nothing" (a no-thing), one inadvertently turns it into "something" (a thing), thus violating its fundamental nature.
*   **The Dialectical Nature of Nothingness:** The article explores Hegel's dialectical approach (thesis, antithesis, synthesis) in relation to nothingness. Being is the thesis, nothing is the antithesis, and becoming is the synthesis. The article emphasizes that the distinction between Being and Nothing is "merely meant" in that both concepts share the same content.
    *   **Being and Nothing are equivalent in content**: Both are bare, undetermined, and lack properties, leading to a synthesis, which can then lead to contradictions.
    *   **Dialetheic Nothing**: This is an understanding of Nothing that treats the contradictions (arising from talking about it) as actually true. That is, Nothing *is* an object and is *not* an object, simultaneously.
*   **Nothing as a Verb ("Nothings"):** The article explores Heidegger's concept of "the nothing noths," suggesting that nothingness has an active, self-negating quality (it "nihilates").
*   **Absolute Nothingness:**
    *   **Beyond Relative Definition:** The article discusses the concept of absolute nothingness, drawing on Zen Buddhism and the Kyoto School.
    *   **Transcending Oppositions:** This type of nothingness transcends all binary oppositions (presence/absence, thing/no-thing), and all relative definitions, including the presence/absence distinction.
    *   **"Place" of Absolute Nothingness:** Nishida speaks of it as a "place," a space where all beings are determined.

**Specific Examples and Approaches:**

*   **Sartre's view**: Absences can be objects of judgements.
*   **Meinong's view**: Non-existent things have some form of Being, and are included in our ontology.
*   **The Eleatic principle**: Nonbeings are causally efficacious, and generalises that nonbeings are causally efficacious, such that they are as equally real as atoms and beings in general.
*   **Eliminating Negation** - Using methods such as the NAND operator to remove negations.
*   **Eliminating True Negative Existentials** - "Pegasus does not exist" and its paradoxes
*   **Eliminating Referring Terms** - Russell's descriptions.
*   **Eliminating Existentially Loaded Quantification** - Meinong's theory of objects, Lejewski, and Azzouni.

**Overall Implications:**

The central implication is the inherent difficulty and potential self-contradiction in attempting to define or describe nothingness. The article explores various philosophical approaches to navigate this challenge, including viewing nothingness as:

*   A presence of absence
*   An absence of presence
*   Both
*   Neither presence nor absence
