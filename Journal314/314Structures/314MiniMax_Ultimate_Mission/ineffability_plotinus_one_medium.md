The web content is a blog post comparing the concept of ineffability in Nagarjuna and Plotinus. It directly addresses the user's query and provides relevant information.

Here's the breakdown:

**Relevance:**

*   The core topic is "Plotinus's concept of The One as beyond being and ineffable". The article explicitly discusses Plotinus's One and its ineffability.
*   The article explains *why* the One cannot be predicated, linking it to its simplicity and lack of properties.
*   The article uses the term "ineffable" and defines it in the context of the discussion.
*   The article provides a comparative analysis by examining Nagarjuna's perspective on ineffability, which provides context and helps understand Plotinus's view better.

**Data Extraction:**

**Plotinus's Concept of The One:**

*   **Nature of The One:** The ultimate reality, the first principle of everything. It is beyond Being. It is pure unity.
*   **Why it is Ineffable:**
    *   Because of its simplicity; it has no properties or predicates.
    *   Any predicate would introduce plurality, violating its absolute unity.
    *   It is the source of all forms and cannot itself be a form.
    *   Material objects are grasped by the senses, and the objects of knowledge, the objects of the intellect, are the immaterial Ideas or forms that proceed from the One. But since the One is the cause of forms, it is not itself a form. So, the One cannot be known by the intellect.
*   **Argument for the One:** Plotinus argues that for anything *to be* is for it *to be one*, to have some kind of unity. This unity ultimately leads to the One, which is unity pure and simple.
*   **Quote on Ineffability:** "But we in our travail do not know what we ought to say, and are speaking of what cannot be spoken, and give it a name because we want to indicate it to ourselves best we can. Perhaps this name “One” contains only a denial of multiplicity." (*Enneads* V.5.6)
*   **Argument from No Form:** "Since the substance which is generated from the One is form — one could not say that what is generated from that source is anything else — and not the form of some one thing but of everything, so that no form is left outside it, the One must be without form." (*Enneads* V.5.6)

**Comparison with Nagarjuna:**

*   **Similarities:** Both Nagarjuna and Plotinus consider the ultimate reality to be ineffable. The reason for this is the impossibility of applying predicates to ultimate reality.
*   **Differences:** The nature of the ultimate reality differs. For Plotinus, it's the transcendent One; for Nagarjuna, it is the world of interdependent causes and effects.

**Key Concepts:**

*   *Ineffability*: The inability to describe something with words or otherwise.
*   *Nous*: Pure, immaterial intellect or understanding.
*   *Svabhava*: inherent existence, self-nature, or substance.
*   *Shunyata*: emptiness.
*   *Samsara*: the cycle of birth and death.
*   *Nirvana*: a state of liberation.
*   *Bodhisattva*: an enlightened being.
