**Detailed Extraction of Information:**

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information, organized according to your specific request:

*   **Nagarjuna's Assertion of the Fundamental Identity:**

    *   The article focuses on a verse from the Mulamadhyamikakarika (Fundamental Stanzas on the Middle Way), specifically verse 24:18, which is considered central to understanding Nagarjuna's core tenets.
    *   This verse asserts the fundamental identity of:
        *   Emptiness (Śūnyatā), the ultimate truth.
        *   The dependently originated (all phenomena).
        *   Verbal convention/designation.
    *   This verse lays the foundation for understanding the emptiness of emptiness.
*   **Explanation of Emptiness (Śūnyatā):**

    *   Emptiness, for Nagarjuna, means the lack of inherent existence (svabhava) or essence in things. It does not mean complete non-existence.
    *   The content highlights that when a Madhyamika philosopher says a table is empty, it means the table lacks inherent existence, its existence depending on parts, causes, and conventions.
    *   The article emphasizes that emptiness is not a separate void but an aspect of conventional reality.
*   **Dependent Origination (Pratītyasamutpāda):**

    *   Nagarjuna takes it as a fundamental philosophical task to provide an understanding of dependent co-origination.
    *   Dependent origination refers to the nexus between phenomena in virtue of which events depend on other events.
    *   The article investigates how dependency is spelled out, and its status, in Nagarjuna's philosophy.
*   **Verbal Conventions/Designations:**

    *   The article points out that understanding the relation between emptiness, dependent origination, and convention is the "middle-way" philosophical view.
    *   The identity of any dependently arisen thing depends upon verbal conventions.
    *   To say of a thing that its identity is a merely verbal fact about it is to say that it is empty.
*   **Emptiness as the Ultimate Truth/Foundation:**

    *   The article explains the two truths: conventional and ultimate.
    *   Nagarjuna's greatest philosophical contribution is the sophisticated development of the doctrine of the two truths as a vehicle for understanding Buddhist metaphysics and epistemology.
    *   The ultimate truth is emptiness.
    *   The text argues that these three concepts (emptiness, dependent origination, and verbal conventions) are not just related but are fundamentally the same thing.
    *   Emptiness is not a separate entity but the nature of all phenomena.
    *   The article highlights the concept of the "emptiness of emptiness," where even emptiness itself is empty, meaning it lacks inherent existence.
    *   Nagarjuna argues that the emptiness of phenomena is itself empty—the central claim of Madhyamika ontology.

**Additional Important Points from the Article:**

*   **Method of Reductio Ad Absurdum:** The article notes that Nagarjuna uses the method of *reductio ad absurdum* to demonstrate the incoherence of positive metaphysical doctrines, which is a core methodological aspect of his system.
*   **Emptiness of Causation:** The article discusses Nagarjuna's argument for the "emptiness of causation," rejecting the idea of inherent causal powers. Instead, he emphasizes that phenomena arise from conditions.
*   **Two Truths Doctrine:** It provides an understanding of the two truths doctrine (conventional and ultimate truth), where conventional reality is the reality of our everyday experience, while ultimate reality is the emptiness of all phenomena. The article suggests that the two truths are ultimately not separate but are different ways of looking at the same reality.
*   **Antimetaphysical Pragmatism:** The text describes Nagarjuna's approach as an antimetaphysical pragmatism, focusing on the practical implications of understanding emptiness.
*   **Rejection of Nihilism:** The content emphasizes that Nagarjuna's philosophy is not nihilistic. Instead, it provides a nuanced view where conventional reality is not denied but understood as empty of inherent existence.
*   **Central Chapter:** Chapter 24 of the Mulamadhyamikakarika (Examination of the Four Noble Truths) is identified as the central chapter of the text.

In essence, this web content gives a comprehensive overview of Nagarjuna's main ideas, answering all aspects of the user's query, including the technical aspects of his reasoning, his philosophical methods, and his view of reality.
