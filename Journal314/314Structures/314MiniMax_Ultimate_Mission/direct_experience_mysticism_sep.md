The web content is a detailed entry on "Mysticism" from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. It contains a wealth of information relevant to the user's query.

Here's a detailed extraction of the information about "{Extract information on how mystical experiences are characterized as direct, unmediated insights, and the nature of non-conceptual experience in mysticism, including its claim to provide knowledge.}":

**1. Mystical Experiences as Direct and Unmediated Insights:**

*   **Definition of Mystical Experience (Broad Sense):** "Acquaintance of realities in mystical experiences means the subject is putatively aware of one or more realities in a way that overcomes the normal subject/object duality: the “acquaintance” is “knowledge by participation” or “knowledge by identity”... Mystical experiences are allegedly “direct,” “unmediated” insights in that sense."
*   **Acquaintance of States of Affairs:** This direct, unmediated insight can also involve the awareness of states of affairs. This acquaintance of states of affairs comes in two forms:
    *   A subject is aware of one or more realities on which states of affairs supervene.
    *   Acquaintance of states of affairs involves an insight directly, without supervening on acquaintance of any reality.

**2. Nature of Non-Conceptual Experience:**

*   **Nonsensory Awareness:** The broader definition includes "a purportedly nonsensory awareness or a nonstructured sensory experience..."
*   **Nonstructured Sensory Experience:** This refers to experiences with "phenomenological sensory content but lacks the conceptualization normally structuring sense-perception."
*   **Buddhist Traditions and Non-Conceptual Experience:** "Many Buddhist traditions, however, make no claim for an experience of a supersensory reality but instead cultivate an experience of “unconstructed awareness” involving an awareness of the world on a completely or partially non-conceptual level."
*   **Knowledge of the True Nature:** The non-conceptual experience is thought to "grant knowledge of the true nature of phenomenal reality, such as the impermanent nature of all things."

**3. Claim to Provide Knowledge:**

*   **Noetic Quality:** Mystical experiences are alleged to be "noetic," i.e., giving knowledge of what a subject apprehends. This includes both introvertive and extrovertive experiences.
*   **James's View:** "As Chris Letheby puts it: “Noetic quality refers to a strong sense of gaining a genuine and unmediated insight, or of encountering ultimate reality; the mystical experience, by definition, is felt to be ‘more real than real’"
*   **Epistemology Section:** The entry has a whole section (Section 9) on Epistemology and discusses the evidential value and knowledge claims associated with Mystical Experiences.
*   **Argument from Experience:** The entry outlines "The Argument from Experience" as a defense for the evidential value of religious and mystical experiences.
*   **Doxastic Practice Approach:** This approach addresses whether mystics are warranted in thinking that their experiences are veridical.
