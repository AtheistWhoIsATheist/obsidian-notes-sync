Here's a breakdown of how epistemological pluralism helps reorganize interdisciplinary research, based on the provided content:

**Relevance:** The document is directly relevant to the query. It's a scientific journal article discussing "Epistemological pluralism: reorganizing interdisciplinary research."

**Key Findings and Data:**

*   **Core Argument:** The paper argues that scholars, educators, and practitioners need to rethink how interdisciplinary research and training are conducted. It proposes epistemological pluralism as a valuable approach.
*   **Epistemological Pluralism Defined:** Epistemological pluralism acknowledges that various ways of knowing are valid within a research context. Accommodating this plurality can lead to more successful integrated study.
*   **Application to Social-Ecological Systems:** This approach is particularly useful in the study and management of social-ecological systems.
*   **Methodological Approach:** The authors use resilience theory's adaptive cycle to show how epistemological pluralism can facilitate the reorganization of interdisciplinary research. This helps avoid the accumulation of disciplinary-dominated research that lacks sufficient integration.
*   **Case Studies:** The paper uses two case studies—urban ecology and social-ecological research in Alaska—to illustrate how interdisciplinary work can be hampered when different epistemologies aren't recognized and valued. The incorporation of a pluralistic framework allows for better exploration of these issues, leading to a more integrated understanding.

**In summary, the paper highlights that epistemological pluralism helps reorganize interdisciplinary research by:**

1.  **Recognizing and Valuing Multiple Ways of Knowing:** It acknowledges the validity of diverse epistemological perspectives.
2.  **Facilitating Integrated Study:** Accommodating different ways of knowing leads to more successful research integration.
3.  **Using Resilience Theory:** Specifically, the adaptive cycle is used to demonstrate how this reorganization works.
4.  **Avoiding Disciplinary Silos:** It helps prevent the accumulation of research dominated by single disciplines, which may lack integration.
5.  **Improving Understanding:** The approach allows for the better exploration of problems and provides more comprehensive understanding.
