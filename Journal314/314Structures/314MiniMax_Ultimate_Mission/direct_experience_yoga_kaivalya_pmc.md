The article directly addresses the concept of *Kaivalya* in yoga, its relationship to yoga practices, particularly *Samadhi*, and its nature as the ultimate freedom or realization.

**Detailed Data Extraction:**

Here's a detailed extraction of information on *Kaivalya* from the provided text:

*   **Definition of Kaivalya:**
    *   *Kaivalya* is defined as the "ultimate freedom" that is the purpose and end goal of yoga practices.
    *   It is described as a state of being where the practitioner is free from all external influences and disturbances.
    *   It is a state where Purusha (pure consciousness) is isolated from Prakruti (nature).
    *   It is a state of supreme consciousness established in its own self, unrelated to and unconcerned with Buddhi (intellect).
*   **Achieving Kaivalya through Yoga Practices:**
    *   The article mentions that achieving Kaivalya requires following the steps outlined in Sage Patanjali's *Yoga Sutras*.
    *   *Yama* and *Niyama* are ethical codes that are necessary to overcome emotional disturbances to the mind.
    *   *Asanas* make the body supple and strong, providing a platform for inner yogic practices.
    *   *Pranayama* facilitates the flow of *prana* (life force), which enables *pratyahara* that directs the senses inward.
    *   **Samadhi:** The text emphasizes the role of *Samadhi* in the path to *Kaivalya*. It mentions:
        *   The progression from *Sabija Samadhi* (with seed) to seedless *Samadhi*.
        *   In seedless *Samadhi*, the yogi is in complete control of the thoughtless state.
    *   Intense practice (*tapas*) and *vairagya* (detachment) are also essential.
*   **Nature of Kaivalya:**
    *   It is a state where Purusha and Prakruti are separated.
    *   *Avidya* (ignorance) and *Asmita* (ego) are the two *kleshas* (afflictions) that cause bondage, and *Kaivalya* is the solution to overcome them.
    *   The individual in *Kaivalya* is beyond the *gunas* (qualities) of *Prakruti*, and the *gunas* revert to their origin.
    *   It is a state of transcendence and is described as the ultimate truth.
*   **Additional points:**
    *   The article mentions that the *siddhis* (supernatural powers) attained through yoga practices should be bypassed if one aims to realize the ultimate truth.
    *   It highlights the stages of consciousness in the journey to *Kaivalya*, relating them to the *koshas* (sheaths) of the individual. The consciousness becomes more focused as it penetrates the deeper koshas.
    *   The text mentions that the practice progresses through four stages of consciousness, each being more subtle than the previous one.
