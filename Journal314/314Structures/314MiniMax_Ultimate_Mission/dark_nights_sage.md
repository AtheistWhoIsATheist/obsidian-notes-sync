Here is a detailed extraction of the information about "Dark Nights of the Soul" from the provided content:

**1. Abstract:**

*   The article combines phenomenological, clinical, and neurocognitive levels of analysis to understand the cognitive bases of spirituality and spiritual suffering.
*   It compares the "dark night of the soul" in classical mysticism, with its painful "metapathological" loss of felt meaning, to the anhedonias central to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and schizotypicality.
*   It references Paul Schilder's work on instabilities in the body image, as our core sense of self, as a key to understanding both the disorganized hallucinatory syndromes of psychosis and the relative enhancements of body image/ecological self in spirituality.
*   It proposes that expanded versus deleted felt presence/embodiment, indexed in measures of physical balance and spatial abilities, is the general dimension underlying integrative versus disintegrative transformations of consciousness.
*   It suggests that "dark night" suffering can be seen as a semantic satiation leading to a relative deletion of experienced presence in the context of its previous enhancement, a focalized version of the more general anhedonic despair shared by clinical schizotypy and aspects of a larger secularized culture.

**5. Relevant Concepts and Perspectives:**

*   **Phenomenological Analysis:** The article employs a phenomenological approach to analyze the subjective experience of spiritual suffering, particularly within the context of the "dark night of the soul."
*   **Neurocognitive Analysis:** The study incorporates neurocognitive perspectives to explore the cognitive underpinnings of spirituality and spiritual suffering.
*   **Spiritual Suffering:** The study focuses on spiritual suffering, specifically the "dark night of the soul," and its related painful experiences.
*   **Mysticism:** The article examines classical mysticism, providing insights into the phenomenology of the "dark night of the soul."
*   **Psychosis:** The study relates the experience of the "dark night" to the negative symptoms (anhedonia) of schizophrenia and schizotypicality.
*   **Body Image and Self:** It connects the experience of spiritual suffering to instabilities in the body image and the core sense of self. Paul Schilder's work on body image is mentioned as a key.
*   **Presence and Embodiment:** The article uses the dimension of expanded versus deleted felt presence/embodiment, as indexed in measures of physical balance and spatial abilities, to understand the transformation of consciousness.
*   **Semantic Satiation:** The study suggests "dark night" suffering can be a result of semantic satiation leading to a deletion of experienced presence.
