**Relevance:**

The web content is *highly relevant* to the user's query. The title of the article directly addresses the key concepts: "Total Kenosis, True Shunyata, and the Plerotic Self of Thomas Merton and Masao Abe." The article explores the understanding of kenosis and śūnyatā by both Merton and Abe, and also introduces and defines the concept of the "plerotic self." It then further examines the relationship between these concepts and their relation to the idea of fullness.

**Detailed Information Extraction:**

Here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information, organized for clarity:

**1. Thomas Merton's Understanding:**

*   **False Self:** Merton defines the self as having two parts: the "false self" (also called "lower self," "external self," "inferior self," "illusory self," "outer self," "selfhood") which is a constructed and not-real self. It is tied to desires and created identities. The false self consists of self-identity and self-will.
*   **True Self:**  The "true self" (also called "upper self," "superior self," "inner self," "deep self," "real self," "original nature") is the actual, present self expressed through union with God.  The true self is perpetual and simultaneous self-negation and self-affirmation in God. The true self is self-negation in the sense that we must completely give up the false self. The true self is self-affirmation in the sense that we become more complete as a result of our unification with God in the true self.

**2. Masao Abe's Understanding:**

*   **Self-centeredness:** Abe identifies self-centeredness as the root of human suffering, manifesting in four forms: individual, national, anthropocentric, and religious.
    *   Individual:  The ego, the basic subject-object duality.
    *   National: The "group-self" of a sovereign nation-state.
    *   Anthropocentric: Assuming humanity as one's substantial self-identity.
    *   Religious: Assuming the ultimate principle of religion as one's self-identity.
*   **No-self:** Abe argues the only way to be free from self-centeredness is through no-self.
*   ***Kenosis*** **and total *kenosis* (Self-emptying in Christianity):** Abe uses the concept of *kenosis* as presented in Philippians 2:5-8 to explain how Christ emptied himself of his divine rank. Abe says that *kenosis* must be a total *kenosis* for Christ to be Christ. Abe reformulates the doctrine of Christ’s *kenosis*: "The Son of God is not the Son of God (for he is essentially and fundamentally self-emptying): precisely because he *is not* the Son of God he *is* truly the Son of God (for he originally and always works as Christ, the Messiah, in his salvational function of self-emptying)."
*   ***Shunyata*** **and true *shunyata* (Emptiness in Buddhism):** Abe connects *shunyata* to the concept of no-self. *Shunyata* is unobjectifiable and thoroughly self-negative, emptying everything, including itself. Two considerations for understanding: it is not a goal but the ground from which Buddhist life begins, and it should be understood in its verbal form (“self-emptying”).
*   **Relationship between *kenosis* and *shunyata*:**  Abe equates true *shunyata* with the true self. *Satori*, or awakening, "in Zen is nothing but the self-awakening of the true Self." Both *shunyata* and *kenosis* are conceptually paradoxical.

**3. The Concept of the "Plerotic Self":**

*   **Definition:** *Plerosis* (self-fulfilling) is derived from the ancient Greek *pleros* meaning "full." The *plerotic* self is the self-fulfilling self, which is the ultimate effect of total *kenosis* and true *shunyata*.
*   **Relationship to *kenosis* and *shunyata*:**  *Kenosis* = *plerosis* and *shunyata* = *plerosis*, because *plerosis* is the ultimate effect and counterpart of *kenosis* and *shunyata*.
*   **Three-part definition of *plerosis*:**
    1.  *Kenosis* is self-emptying, *shunyata* is total emptiness, and *plerosis* is self-fulfilling.
    2.  *Kenosis* = *plerosis* and *shunyata* = *plerosis,* because *plerosis* is the ultimate effect and counterpart of *kenosis* and *shunyata*.
    3.  However, although *kenosis* = *plerosis* and *shunyata* = *plerosis*, *kenosis* ≠ *shunyata*.

**4. Perpetual Self-Negation and Self-Affirmation in God (Merton):**

*   The true self is perpetual and simultaneous self-negation and self-affirmation in God.
    *   Self-negation: Giving up the false self.
    *   Self-affirmation: Becoming more complete through unification with God.

**5. Relationship Between Emptying Concepts and Fullness:**

*   *Kenosis* and *shunyata* are unique parallels originating from the same point.
*   Abe affirms that the intersection between immanence and transcendence “is symbolized in Christianity by Jesus Christ who is the true human and the true God, and in Buddhism by Shunyata, in which emptiness and fullness are dynamically identical.”
*   The *plerotic* self, as the self-fulfilling self, is the ultimate goal. It is the ontological reality for both Buddhism and Christianity.
*   The article asserts that, in Merton's view, the major difference in the two views of the self is their dependence or non-dependence on history. Merton’s thought requires the personal and historical necessity of Christ’s *kenosis*, whereas Abe’s thought stresses the ahistorical and non-personal aspect of true *shunyata*.

**6. Comparisons and Contrasts:**

*   **Merton vs. Abe:**
    *   Merton is a mystic aiming to invoke religious experience, speaking vaguely.
    *   Abe is a philosopher aiming for interreligious dialogue, clarifying his philosophy.
*   Both would agree on the substance of each other's points.
*   Abe's philosophy suggests uniting *kenosis* (Christianity) and *shunyata* (Buddhism) to find common ground.
*   Merton focuses on personal religious experience, transcending conceptual duality.
*   Abe is critical of the current state of both religions, with a shared spiritual basis that will be revealed through self-purification.
*   *Kenosis* and *shunyata* are not identical but are unique parallels.
