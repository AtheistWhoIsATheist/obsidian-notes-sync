Here's a detailed analysis of the provided web content concerning the knowledge argument:

**1. Relevance to the Query:**

The web content is highly relevant to the query. It is a comprehensive entry from the *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)* dedicated to "Qualia: The Knowledge Argument." The article explicitly addresses the knowledge argument, its aim to establish that conscious experience involves non-physical properties, and its relevance to the philosophical status of experiential knowledge, including non-conceptual or mystical insights.

**2. Detailed Extraction of Information:**

Here's a breakdown of the key information extracted from the article, organized according to the query's focus:

*   **The Knowledge Argument's Aim:**
    *   The primary aim of the knowledge argument is to demonstrate that conscious experience involves non-physical properties.
    *   It argues against physicalism, the view that everything is physical or supervenes on the physical.

*   **Core Idea of the Knowledge Argument:**
    *   The argument centers on the idea that someone can possess complete physical knowledge about another conscious being (e.g., Mary and her knowledge of color vision) but still lack knowledge of what it's *like* to have the experiences of that being (the subjective, qualitative aspects or qualia).

*   **Relevance to the Philosophical Status of Experiential Knowledge:**
    *   The knowledge argument directly challenges the idea that all knowledge can be reduced to or explained by physical facts.
    *   It raises questions about the nature of knowledge itself, distinguishing between "knowing that" (propositional knowledge) and "knowing what it's like" (experiential knowledge or acquaintance knowledge).
    *   It implies that some knowledge, such as the knowledge of qualia, may be fundamentally different from other types of knowledge, potentially involving non-physical properties or requiring a subjective perspective.
    *   The argument is also relevant to the concept of objectivism, with some interpretations suggesting that it challenges the notion that an objective description of reality can be complete.

*   **Discussion of Non-Conceptual or Mystical Insights:**
    *   The text explicitly mentions the relevance to the philosophical status of *experiential knowledge*. While not directly discussing *mystical insights*, the argument's focus on the irreducibility of subjective experience inherently relates to any form of knowledge gained through direct experience. It can be extended to analyze any experiential knowledge, including mystical experiences that provide non-conceptual or non-propositional forms of knowledge, even if not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
    *   The article's discussion of phenomenal concepts and phenomenal beliefs relates to the kind of insights that are gained through direct experience.

*   **Key Components and Examples:**
    *   **Mary's Room:** The classic thought experiment where a neuroscientist, Mary, knows everything physical about color vision but has never seen colors. Upon seeing color, she learns something new.
    *   **Fred:** A thought experiment involving a person who can see a color unknown to others, highlighting the limitations of physical knowledge in capturing subjective experience.

*   **Versions of the Argument:**
    *   **Weaker Version (V1):** Mary has complete *physical knowledge* but gains *new knowledge* that is non-physical.
    *   **Stronger Version (V2):** Mary knows all *physical facts* but learns *non-physical facts*.

*   **Main Objections and Counter-Arguments (with detailed summaries of the key views):**
    *   **Doubts about the Thought Experiment:** The validity of Mary's situation is questioned, focusing on whether someone could be in such a situation or if her knowledge is complete.
        *   **The Ignorance Hypothesis:** This argument by Stoljar claims that we are not in an informed position about whether or not Mary would know the phenomenal facts.
        *   **McClelland's Dilemma:** If we're not forthcoming with evidence, the argument can't be accepted, but the fact is that it's redundant.
    *   **Complete Physical Knowledge Without Knowledge of all the Physical Facts:** The premise that Mary has complete physical knowledge implies that she also knows all physical facts is challenged.
    *   **No Propositional Knowledge:**
        *   **The Ability Hypothesis (Lewis, Nemirow):** Mary gains abilities (recognizing, imagining) but no new propositional knowledge (facts).
        *   **The Acquaintance Hypothesis (Conee):** Mary gains "acquaintance knowledge," a third category distinct from propositional knowledge or abilities.
    *   **New Knowledge/Old Fact View:** Mary gains new *propositional* knowledge, but the facts she learns were already known under another conceptualization (Horgan, Tye, Lycan, Papineau).
        *   Various representationalist views on phenomenal concepts (Lycan, Tye, Papineau, Perry, Loar) are considered.
    *   **Objections Against the New Knowledge/Old Fact View:** Counterarguments are presented based on the idea that the different modes of presentation do involve the introduction of different reference-fixing properties (Lockwood, White, Chalmers).
    *   **The Knowledge Argument and Objectivism:** The Knowledge Argument is interpreted as an argument against objectivism (Howell).

*   **Dualist Perspective:**
    *   The article discusses potential dualist responses to the knowledge argument, acknowledging the challenge of epiphenomenalism (the view that qualia are causally inert) and its implications.

*   **Related Arguments and Extensions:**
    *   The *explanatory knowledge argument* (Mørch) is discussed which highlights how phenomenal knowledge provides explanations of regularities, and that this argument is different to the physical explanation.
    *   Parallels between the Knowledge Argument and moral philosophy are discussed.

*   **Key Terminology and Concepts:**
    *   Qualia
    *   Physicalism
    *   Epiphenomenalism
    *   Knowledge Argument
    *   Phenomenal Knowledge
    *   Propositional Knowledge
