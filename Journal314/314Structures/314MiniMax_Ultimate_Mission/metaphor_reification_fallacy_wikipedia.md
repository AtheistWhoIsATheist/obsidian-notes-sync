**Relevance:**

The provided Wikipedia article is **highly relevant** to the user's query. It is specifically about "Reification (fallacy)" and provides a definition and explanation of the concept.

**Extracted Information:**

*   **Definition:** Reification (also known as concretism, hypostatization, or the fallacy of misplaced concreteness) is a fallacy of ambiguity, when an abstraction (abstract belief or hypothetical construct) is treated as if it were a concrete real event or physical entity.
*   **Explanation:** It's the error of treating something that is not concrete, such as an idea, as a concrete thing. A common case of reification is the confusion of a model with reality: "the map is not the territory".
*   **Context of Use:** Reification is part of normal usage of natural language, as well as of literature, where a reified abstraction is intended as a figure of speech, and actually understood as such. But the use of reification in logical reasoning or rhetoric is misleading and usually regarded as a fallacy.
*   **Etymology:** The term "reification" comes from "res" ("thing") and "-fication" (from "facere", meaning "to make"), translating to "thing-making".
*   **Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness:** According to Alfred North Whitehead, it's the mistake of treating an abstract belief, opinion, or concept about the way things are for a physical or "concrete" reality.
*   **Vicious Abstractionism:** William James used this term to criticize certain philosophical approaches. He described it as singling out a feature, classifying it, and then using the concept privatively, reducing the phenomenon to the naked suggestions of that name abstractly taken.
*   **Use of Constructs in Science:** The article mentions how constructs (hypothetical explanatory variables) like motivation and gravity are used in science. It notes that the validity of a construct depends on empirical research demonstrating construct validity.
*   **Example:** Stephen Jay Gould's use of the fallacy to argue that the use of intelligence quotient scores doesn't mean intelligence is a real thing.
*   **Relation to other fallacies:**
    *   **Pathetic Fallacy:** A specific type of reification, where human characteristics are attributed to abstract ideas.
    *   **Animistic Fallacy:** Attributing personal intention to an event or situation.
*   **Rhetorical Device:** The rhetorical devices of metaphor and personification can express a form of reification.
*   **Counterexamples:** The article mentions that reification is sometimes considered a valid argument, such as in the work of Thomas Schelling.
*   **Related Fallacies:** The article also distinguishes reification from other fallacies of ambiguity, such as Equivocation, Amphiboly, Composition, Division, etc.
