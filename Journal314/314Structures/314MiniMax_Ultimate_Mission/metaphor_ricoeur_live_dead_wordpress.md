**NOTES on Paul Ricoeur (1913-2005): The Metaphorical Process**

The content focuses on Paul Ricoeur's philosophy of language, particularly his ideas on metaphor. It discusses Ricoeur's distinction between live and dead metaphors, providing the following key points:

*   **Ricoeur's Main Ideas:**
    *   **Tension in Metaphor:** "Metaphor proceeds from the tension between all the terms in a metaphorical statement." This tension arises from the unexpected juxtaposition of words, forcing the reader to interpret the relationship.
    *   **Interpretation is Key:** "...metaphor does not exist in itself, but in an interpretation. Metaphorical interpretation presupposes a literal interpretation which is destroyed." The meaning of a metaphor isn't inherent in the words themselves but emerges through interpretation.
    *   **Calculated Error:** Metaphor "is a calculated error. It consists in assimilating things which do not go together. But precisely by means of this calculated error, metaphor discloses a relationship of meaning hitherto unnoticed between terms which were prevented from communicating by former classifications.” Metaphors intentionally create a "mistake" that, through interpretation, reveals new connections.
    *   **Metaphors of Invention:** "True metaphors are *metaphors of invention* in which a new extension of the meanings of the words answers a novel discordance in the sentence." This points to the innovative nature of true metaphors.
    *   **Untranslatability of True Metaphors:** "...true metaphors are untranslatable.... Tension metaphors are untranslatable because they create meaning." The inherent meaning of a live metaphor is lost when translated.
    *   **Metaphor's Function:** "...metaphor is not an ornament of discourse. Metaphor has more than an emotional value. It includes *new information*. ... In short, metaphor says something new about reality." Metaphors are not merely stylistic devices but convey new information about reality.

*   **Live vs. Dead Metaphors:** Ricoeur distinguishes between live and dead metaphors.
    *   **Dead metaphors** have lost their original metaphorical impact through overuse and become part of everyday language. An example provided is the phrase "foot of a chair" or "leg of a table."
    *   **Live metaphors** create new meaning, challenge existing classifications, and are central to poetic and religious language.
