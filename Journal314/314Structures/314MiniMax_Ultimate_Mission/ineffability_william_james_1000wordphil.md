Here's a breakdown of the William James's views on mystical experience, particularly focusing on ineffability, based on the provided text:

**1. Defining Mystical Experience**

*   **Definition:** For William James, mystical experience is a type of religious experience. He aimed to define it because he believed its elements, like awareness of an unseen reality, are central to all religious experiences.
*   **Key Traits:** James identifies four main characteristics: ineffability, noetic quality, transiency, and passivity. He also mentions additional characteristics like a sense of oneness, monism, pantheism, compatibility with a supernatural worldview, and optimism.

**1.1. Ineffable**

*   **Description:** Mystical experiences are, in part, *ineffable*, meaning they are difficult or impossible to fully express in language.
*   **Challenge:** Individuals who have mystical experiences struggle to accurately convey what happened to them when they return to ordinary awareness.
*   **James's View:** James states that no adequate report of a mystical experience can be given in words.
*   **Explanation:** This doesn’t mean mystical experiences can’t be described at all; metaphors and poetic language can be used. Mystical experiences are like emotions; they must be directly experienced to be fully understood.
*   **Supporting Quote:** "The subject of it [i.e., mystical experience] immediately says it defies expression, that no adequate report of its contents can be given in words." (James, 1902/2004, p. 329)
*   **Analogies:** Describing these experiences is similar to describing emotions; one must experience them to understand fully. James writes, "that its quality must be directly experienced; it cannot be imparted or transferred to others. In this peculiarity mystical states are more like states of feeling than like states of intellect."
*   **Further Explanation:** James (1902/2004: p. 351) also writes, “This incommunicableness of the transport is the keynote of all mysticism. Mystical truth exists for the individual who has the transport, but for no one else.”
*   **Counterpoint:** The text mentions that Franks Davis (1989) disagrees with James, stating that ineffability is not unique to mystical experiences, as most, if not all, religious experiences are ineffable to some degree.

**Additional Information**

*   The text also discusses other characteristics of mystical experiences, such as the *noetic quality* (the experience feels like a state of knowledge), *transiency* (they are usually short-lived), and *passivity* (they feel like they happen to the experiencer).
*   The text explores whether mystical experiences are authoritative, meaning whether they justify beliefs based on them. James believes they are authoritative for the person having the experience but not for others.
