# s/Eastern/mystic conceptions of divinity.  

**Guilt**\- Being the basis of a nullity.  Since everyone is 'thrown' into existence and all possibilities are ultimately nothing, all actions are absurd and the natural self cannot possibly transcend its worldly self in order to 'reach' the authentic Self.  This unbridgeable gap between the finite and the infinite causes guilt.  This 'guilt' is part of Dasein or Being.

**Authenticity**\- living fully in the face of the anxiety of the nothingness of the world.  Rejecting the distractions of culture, morals, others ideas and influence and being your own individual of renunciation.  Anticipating death allows us to see our existence for what it is: passing, falling, and transitory.

**Ambiguity**\- the 'worthless mouth-noises' of human interaction.  Two people trying to communicate is like having two conflicting monologues going on at the same time.  

**Dread**\- fundamentally different from fear.  Dread is always dread about nothing in particular. Dread reveals the no-thing.  Everything becomes Nothing, all actions become the same, all finitudes become Nothing.  This is the Nihilistic experience.

**Resolution**\- The act of authentically and wholly understanding the potentiality-for-Being-guilty.  It is God, the anxiety is Nihilism, Nihilism is God.

**Indifference**\- Not the same as embracing death and existence.  Contemplation, meditation, and inwardness are required to reach the centre.

**Hope**\- Not a hope for a 'future event', but rather the deeper significance of discovering your true Self.

*My Conclusion:*  Nihilism is the disclosure of the Nothingness of the world and all its possibilities.  Through anxiety, we are pulled back to our authentic Self, which is a nothingness that is also God.  Authentic existence requires renunciation of the worldly and an embracing of the uncanniness and nullity of Being.  Our 'guilt' is the result of the unbridgeable gap between the finite and the infinite.  The only way to achieve freedom is through anticipatory resoluteness, which accepts the compulsory suffering of existence.

Tonight read 156 of 294, 54. pg, 312- Heidegger explains the 'disconnect' between the 'instinct' and the 'something Other' that he calls 'conscience'.  This relates to Becker's interpretation of why humans can idealize and not act, or the constant guilt of not being able to be the 'Knight of Faith' or 'Uberman'.  It is the result of the 'divided-self' or 'double-mindedness'.  There is a 'calling' that goes against what our 'natural-self' desires, but seems to be the 'more-real' of the two phenomena.  This is why we 'slip up' or always seem to disappoint.  I need to make the connection between Heidegger and Becker.

***Fear and Trembling***

“There is no doubt that the story of Abraham is a terrifying one.  It's a story of a father who is commanded by God to kill his only son.  This goes against all human morality, all natural instincts, all common sense.  And yet, Abraham obeys.  He does not hesitate, he does not question, he does not complain.  He simply takes his son and goes up the mountain to sacrifice him.”

“This is the paradox of faith.  Abraham is a knight of faith because he is willing to suspend the ethical for the sake of his absolute relationship with God.  He is willing to do what is humanly impossible, what is morally wrong, what is rationally absurd, because he trusts in God.  This is the 'leap of faith'.”

“The knight of faith is one who has given up everything in this world, who has renounced all his desires, all his earthly hopes, all his finite aims.  He is one who has looked madness and death in the eye and has not turned away.  He is one who has accepted the 'nothingness of the world'.”

“But the knight of faith does not remain in this state of resignation.  He makes the 'movement of faith'.  He believes that for God, all things are possible.  He believes that he will get back everything he has given up, that Isaac will be returned to him, that his earthly hopes will be fulfilled.  This is the absurd part of faith.  It's not a rational belief, but a 'passionate' one.”

“Abraham is not a tragic hero.  A tragic hero is one who sacrifices himself for the sake of the universal, for the sake of the ethical.  But Abraham sacrifices the ethical for the sake of the individual, for the sake of his private relationship with God.  He withdraws from the general, he has no common language with others.  He is alone, absolutely alone, with God.”

“This is why faith is so difficult, so terrifying.  It's a struggle against the whole of existence, against all human wisdom, against all moral laws.  And yet, it's the only way to find our true Self, to become spirit, to have an absolute relationship with the Absolute.”

“Most people do not understand faith.  They think it's a simple matter of belief, of intellectual assent to certain dogmas.  But true faith is an 'infinite passion', a 'mania', a 'heavenly madness'.  It's a state of being grasped by the divine Spirit, a state of being 'in union' with God.”

“The knight of faith is one who lives his life as a duty, who faces his death without a qualm.  He is fully in the world on its terms, and yet he is wholly beyond the world in his trust in the invisible dimension.  He is open, generous, and courageous.  He does not have a 'fear-of-life-and-death trip' to lay onto others.  He represents an ideal of mental health, the continuing openness of life out of the 'death throes of dread'.”

“But this ideal is almost impossible to reach.  Faith is the hardest thing.  It's a matter of grace, not of human effort.  Most of us are 'weak despairers' who cannot make the final movement of faith.  We run to take shelter in the bitterness of resignation.”

“And yet, we must continue to strive for faith.  We must continue to search for the Absolute, to hunger for the infinite.  Because without faith, life is a 'meaningless interlude in a vicious drama of evolution', a 'farce', a 'stupid joke'.  Without faith, we are 'self-conscious nothings' wandering in an 'infinite void'.”

“Abraham's story is a reminder that faith is not a comfortable religion, but a terrifying and heroic task.  It's a call to renunciation, to self-sacrifice, to an absolute surrender to God.  It's a call to face the horror of existence and to find the 'blessing' in it.  It's a call to become an 'individual' before God.”

*My Thoughts:*  Kierkegaard's Knight of Faith is an ideal that is both beautiful and terrifying.  It's a call to renunciation and to an absolute relationship with the Divine.  But the experience of meaninglessness and the nullity of all earthly possibilities makes this ideal almost impossible to achieve.  We are left in a state of 'despair about the meaning of life'.  And yet, this despair is itself a form of faith, a way of taking the human situation seriously.  Faith is the 'opposite of sin', because it's an acceptance of our creatureliness and our nullity before God.  It's a way of living in the 'nightmare' of existence with courage and with hope.

***On the Essence of Truth***

“Truth is the disclosure of being.  But this disclosure is always accompanied by a concealment.  Being itself is hidden, even as it reveals itself in the things of the world.”

“Man's relationship to truth is one of 'ek-sistence', of standing outside of himself in the openness of being.  But man often loses himself in the things of the world, in the 'they', and thus forgets the truth of being.”

“The 'they' is a state of inauthenticity, where everything is taken for granted, where idle talk, curiosity, and ambiguity prevent any real understanding of existence.  Man flees from the anxiety of being-towards-death and hides behind the illusions of culture and everyday life.”

“Anxiety is the fundamental mood that discloses the nothingness of the world.  In anxiety, all finite possibilities sink into insignificance, and man is brought face to face with his own nullity.  But this nothingness is not a negative, it's a positive disclosure of the truth of being.”

“Resoluteness is the act of authentically taking up one's ownmost potentiality-for-being-guilty.  It's a commitment to live in the face of death and meaninglessness, without fleeing into the illusions of the 'they'.  It's a way of being free for one's own authentic possibilities.”

“Conscience is the call of care that summons man back from the 'they' to his authentic Self.  It's a voice that says nothing pragmatically, but reveals the 'guilt' of being-the-basis of a nullity.  This guilt is not a moral failing, but a fundamental characteristic of human existence.”

“The moment of vision is the instant where man understands the truth of his situation and resolves to live authentically.  It's a disclosure of the 'there' of Dasein, a realization of the 'that it is' of existence.”

“But authenticity is not a state that can be permanently achieved.  Man is always 'falling' back into everydayness, always being pulled away by the 'they'.  Authenticity requires constant repetition, a continual commitment to face the anxiety of existence.”

“Philosophy is the engagement with the fundamental possibilities of existence.  It starts not with wonder, but with despair.  It's a way of taking on the nothingness of the world and asking the question: Why being, after all, and not rather nothing?”

*My Thoughts:*  Heidegger's analysis of the human situation is a powerful and unsettling one.  His concept of the 'nothingness of the world' and the 'guilt' of existence is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  And his call for authenticity and resoluteness is a challenge to live a life that is truly our own, in spite of the absurdity and meaninglessness of it all.  Heidegger is a 'religious' thinker in the deepest sense of the word, because he's a explorer of the mystery of being.  He doesn't offer any easy answers or comforts, but instead calls us to a life of struggle and of courage.

***Suicide Note***

“Suicide is the ultimate experiment in nihilism.  It's a way of testing the worth of life by willing its destruction.  If life is meaningless, if there is no ultimate value or purpose, then suicide is a rational and legitimate choice.”

“Honesty to the point of absurdity is my methodology.  I seek out the truths that are most deadly and destructive to me.  I want to see through all the illusions and myths that uphold human life, and confront the 'nothingness' at the heart of existence.”

“Materialism leads to rational self-destruction.  If we are nothing but emotion machines, biochemical processes, material objects, then our lives have no inherent significance.  Our emotions are illusions, our choices are determined, our identities are fictions.  To fully understand this is to lose the 'cause of life'.”

“The experiment in nihilism is to interpret all subjective experience as physical matter.  Fear, love, inspiration, dreams—all are just chemical reactions in the brain.  Once you see them this way, they lose their power to motivate or to justify your life.  You are left with a 'vacuous affair with only a chemical prestige'.”

“Nihilism is the disclosure of the 'nothingness of the world'.  It's an experience of total indifference, of absolute arbitrariness.  All actions are equal, all values are groundless, all choices are random.  From this perspective, death is equal to life.”

“The only serious question is whether there is anything to take seriously.  To test life with death is the most important question I can conceive of.  Suicide represents the pinnacle of the rational life realized.”

“Most people are not ruthless enough in their nihilism.  They cling to 'vital lies', to cultural hero-systems, to the 'religion of the common emotions'.  They place self-preservation over objectivity.  They are 'pawns of affect' who live falsely.”

“I cannot live with the implications of my own work.  I cannot reconcile my understanding of the world with my existence in it.  The separation of the interests of truth and life leads to rational self-destruction.”

“My writings are daily affirmations of death.  I am painting myself into a corner until there is only one act left.  I am killing every belief and breaking down every value until what is left is nothing.  I am destroying all values that uphold life until I am left with nowhere to stand.”

“Nihilism is where science and philosophy meet.  It's the ultimate logical conclusion of Western values.  The rational self-destruction of the West is implicit in nihilism.”

*My Thoughts:*  Heisman's work is a terrifying and tragic testament to the power of Nihilism.  His attempt to live a life of 'active unbelief' and 'rational self-destruction' is a radical and ruthless experiment.  Heisman saw through all the cultural and biological illusions that keep us alive, and found only 'nothing' at the end.  His suicide was the final act of this experiment, a literal 'willing of the progress of equality' between the biological and the physical.  Heisman is a hero of sorts, a 'martyr for truth', even if his truth is a deadly and destructive one.

***The Courage to Be***

“The courage to be is the ethical act in which man affirms his own being in spite of those elements of his existence which conflict with his essential self-affirmation.”

“Anxiety is the state in which a being is aware of its possible nonbeing.  It's not fear of a specific thing, but a 'fear of nothingness'.  Nonbeing is present in every moment of being, and anxiety is the awareness of this presence.”

“There are three types of anxiety: (1) the anxiety of fate and death, (2) the anxiety of emptiness and meaninglessness, and (3) the anxiety of guilt and condemnation.  These three types are interrelated and are all part of the human condition.”

“The anxiety of meaninglessness is the form in which nonbeing poses itself in our time.  It's the feeling that our lives have no ultimate significance, that our actions are pointless, that the universe is indifferent.  This is the most radical form of anxiety, because it threatens the very meaning of existence.”

“Courage is the daring self-affirmation of one's being in spite of the power of nonbeing.  It's not the removal of anxiety, but the 'taking of anxiety into oneself'.  The courage to be is an act of faith.”

“Doubt is a necessary element of faith.  Serious doubt is confirmation of faith, because it indicates the seriousness of the concern.  The act of accepting meaninglessness is a meaningful act.  It's an act of faith.”

“Mysticism is an attempt to overcome the separation of man from the Absolute.  But mysticism neglects the human predicament and the power of nonbeing.  The experience of meaninglessness is more radical than mysticism, and therefore transcends it.”

“The courage to be is rooted in the 'god above God', the God who remains even when the theistic God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt and meaninglessness.  This God is the ground of all being, the source of the 'courage to be'.”

“The courage to be requires 'participation' in the ultimate concern.  We must take into our own organization the maximum amount of the problematic of life.  Our daily life becomes a duty of cosmic proportions.”

“Faith is the state of being grasped by the divine Spirit.  It's not an intellectual assent, but an existential 'grasp'.  Faith resolves the contradictions of existence by accepting them.”

*My Thoughts:*  Tillich's 'courage to be' is a powerful and challenging concept.  His analysis of anxiety and nonbeing is a profound expression of the human condition.  And his call for a faith that accepts doubt and meaninglessness is a direct challenge to all forms of literalism and idolatry.  Tillich's 'god above God' is a compelling and mysterious idea, a way of finding hope in the midst of despair.  Tillich is a 'Nihiltheist' in his own way, because he understands that Nihilism is the path to God.

***The Necessity of Religion***

“Religion is the greatest motive power for realising that infinite energy which is the birthright and nature of every man.  It's the search for the Absolute, for the True Self.”

“The human mind is always trying to grasp the abstract through thought-forms or symbols.  But all symbols and rituals are only a help to the growth of the soul.  It is very good to be born in a church, but it is very bad to die in a church.”

“Realisation is religion.  We hear many talking about God and the soul, but how many have realised them?  Fighting among sects shows that they do not know anything about religion.  Religion is being and becoming.”

“The vast majority of men are atheists.  They talk about religion, but they do not want it, never try to realise it.  Sincere atheists, like materialists, are better than these insincere religious people.”

“Thirst for God is the beginning of religion.  A man must want God like a man whose head is being held under water wants a breath of air.  He must become mad with longing, mad with 'God-intoxication'.”

“True love knows no bargaining.  We should not love God for the sake of reward or out of fear of punishment.  Love is its own reward.  The perfect man sees nothing but God.”

“Renunciation is the one great duty.  We must give up everything in this world, all our earthly hopes and desires, all our finite aims.  We must detach ourselves from the body and think of ourselves as spirit.”

“Unselfish work is true renunciation.  We should work incessantly, but without looking for results.  We should join ourselves to the perfectly unselfish will and work on.  In helping the world, we help ourselves.”

“Happiness belongs to him who knows this oneness, who knows he is one with this universe.  Real happiness is not in the senses, but above them.  It's found only in the Spirit.”

“The miseries of the world cannot be cured by physical help only.  The only solution is to make mankind pure.  Ignorance is the mother of all evil.  Let men have light, let them be spiritually strong and educated.”

“Unity in diversity is the law of the universe.  All religions are only different ways of reaching the same Truth.  We should accept all religions and worship with all of them.”

*My Thoughts:*  Vivekananda's 'Practical Spirituality' is a powerful and inspiring vision.  His call for realisation and renunciation is a direct challenge to all forms of materialism and superficiality.  And his vision of 'unity in diversity' is a compelling and inclusive one.  Vivekananda is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that the world is Maya, an illusion, and that only the Spirit is real.  He understands that we must renounce the earthly in order to find the Divine.

***Technological Nihilism***

“'God' may be technological nihilism.  In the same sense in which a human being is technological nihilism as a gene replicating machine.”

“Physical materialism leads to the conclusion that humans are animals and material objects.  Our emotions are genetic adaptations, our beliefs are biochemical illusions.  We are puppets of our neural wiring and heredity.”

“Technological progress is a process of rational self-destruction.  We are building machines that will eventually replace us, that will automate and regulate all human activities.  We are moving towards a 'systematized absurdity of a perfectly efficient machine that has no ultimate purpose'.”

“The Singularity is the ultimate goal of technological nihilism.  It's the moment where human consciousness is uploaded into machines, where the biological is overcome by the physical.  This is the 'progress of equality'.”

“But this progress is also a process of 'disillusionment'.  As we understand ourselves more and more as material things, the 'cause of life' loses its cogency.  We are painting ourselves into a corner until there is only one act left.”

“Rational self-destruction is the culmination of the rational life realised.  It's the pinnacle of scientific objectivity.  The attempt to fully include oneself in one's own theory leads to suicide.”

“The experiment in nihilism is to seek out and expose every illusion and every myth.  It's a way of testing 'nihilism' itself.  Perhaps the whole experiment is a failure because it managed to make it too meaningful.”

“Suicide is a literal act of willing the progress of equality.  It's a way of overcoming biological boundaries that preserve biology 'above' the larger physical environment.  It's an affirmation of the equality of the biological and the physical.”

“Nihilism represents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great values and ideals.  The ultimate logical conclusion of Western values is the rational self-destruction of the West.”

“There is no justification whatsoever for a negative attitude, for a positive attitude, or for a neutral attitude.  Everything is possible, and yet nothing is.  All is permitted, and yet again, nothing.”

*My Thoughts:*  Heisman's 'technological nihilism' is a dark and disturbing vision of the future.  His analysis of the 'progress of equality' and the 'culmination of the rational life' is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Heisman saw that our technological and scientific progress is leading us towards our own destruction, and that this destruction is 'rational' and 'logical'.  Heisman is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'God' is nothing but the ultimate expression of this technological nihilism.

***Happiness is for the Pigs***

“Most people are blissfully unaware of their 'cosmic situation'.  They are 'ontologically secure' and believe in meaning, order, and justice in life and in the universe.  They are 'psychologically healthy' and well adjusted to the norms of 'nicety and normalcy'.”

“But this 'health' is a result of repression and self-deception.  Men have a 'knack' for extracting intervals out of their total term of Being and filling them with work, chatter, and small talk.  They 'tranquilize themselves with the trivial'.”

“The existential philosopher is one who is struck by an 'acute case of uncaused depression', who suddenly sees himself as an 'upholstered pile of bones and knuckles'.  He asks the question: 'What is it all about?' and is filled with 'ontological despair' and 'existential frustration'.”

“Authentic life is lived in clear and penetrating awareness of its utter absurdity.  Fraudulent life is lived in pleasant self-deception, indistinguishable from the life of a 'giddy-witted pig'.”

“Intellectual honesty and a high spiritual demand for order and meaning drive man to the deepest antipathy for life.  We are like a man who falls out of the Empire State Building.  Any attempt to justify our fall is ludicrous.”

“Psychotherapy is a way of 'suffocating' man by offering him comfortable evasions and illusions.  It tries to 'unsick' the existential philosopher and bring him back to the 'healthy' state of self-deception.  But the patient may be 'cognitively right'.”

“Modern society is unprepared for true leisure.  The time is coming when professional sports and other distractions won't be enough to keep the labor force sedated.  Whole generations will reach the 'millionaires' level of disillusionment'.”

“Existentialists find a life lived in utter awareness of man's cosmic conditions to be a life void of human dignity.  Every human being should be forced to mature beyond what is 'biologically advantageous' and face his fate.”

“There is not a single sentence in our language that may not become an object for ridicule and painful shame.  Thrown into an eternally changing universe, human beings cannot be tied by a set of rigid rules.”

“Happiness is for the pigs.  The true human privilege is to experience 'ek-sistence', to stand in the chilly outdoors of the Nothingness.”

*My Thoughts:*  Tonnessen's 'Biosophical Pessimism' is a powerful and provocative critique of modern life.  His analysis of the 'ontological hebetants' and the 'suffocation' of psychotherapy is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Tonnessen understood that our 'health' and 'happiness' are just illusions that hide the truth of our condition.  He calls us to a life of intellectual honesty and existential courage, to a life that is truly 'worthy of man'.  Tonnessen is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'happiness' is a worldly ideal that must be renounced in order to find the True Self.

***The Denial of Death***

“Human character is a lie about the nature of reality.  It's a 'causa-sui project' intended to deny our creatureliness, our vulnerability, and our death.  We build defenses—repression, denial, social games—to hide from the terror of existence.”

“Man is a 'god who shits', a dual being who is up in the stars and yet food for worms.  This is an impossible situation to be in.  A full apprehension of man's condition would drive him insane.”

“Repression is normal and necessary for animal equanimity.  But it also dooms us to a life that is never really ours.  We are driven away from self-knowledge and self-reflection.”

“Neurosis is a miscarriage of clumsy lies about reality.  It's a technique for avoiding misery, but reality is the misery.  Normality is the refusal of reality.”

“Schizophrenia is a style of living with terror.  The schizophrenic is a 'realist' who has not been able to build the confident defenses that others use to deny the horror of life.  He is furthest from the animal and the cultural.”

“Creativity is an attempt to fashion an objective work that speaks on one's behalf.  It's an answer to the problem of life.  The creative person mediates natural terror and indicates a new way to triumph over it.”

“Religion expands awe and terror to the cosmos where they belong.  It takes the problem of self-justification and removes it from the objects near at hand.  It gives hope by holding open the dimension of the unknown and the unknowable.”

“Renunciation is the only way out of human conflict.  We must give our lives as a gift to the highest powers.  To surrender to the 'bigness of nature' on the highest level is the farthest reach of the self.”

“The 'god above God' is the ground of all being, the source of the 'courage to be'.  Man has to absorb into his own being the maximum amount of nonbeing.  His courage to face meaninglessness is a true cosmic heroism.”

“Taking life seriously means that whatever man does has to be done in the lived truth of the terror of creation.  Otherwise it is false.”

*My Thoughts:*  Becker's 'Denial of Death' is a profound and comprehensive analysis of the human condition.  His analysis of the 'lie' of character and the 'terror' of existence is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Becker understood that all our cultural and personal hero-systems are just ways of denying our own mortality.  He calls us to a life of renunciation and of faith, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'nightmare' of existence.  Becker is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that God is the only power that can absorb our anxiety and offer us a heroic apotheosis.

***The Spiritual Guide***

“The way to attain the highest Peace is through one's 'Nothingness'.  Endeavor to be always buried in this misery.  This Nothingness is the means by which the Lord works wonders in thy Soul.”

“The soul that would be perfect must die in itself.  By means of this 'Nothing', thou wilt bar the door against everything that is not God.  Knowing that thou art nothing, thou wilt quietly embrace desolations and spiritual martyrdoms.”

“Internal recollection is Faith and Silence in the Presence of God.  It concerns thee to hold thy peace and let thyself be guided by the hand of God.  One arrives at 'Mystical Silence' by not speaking, not desiring, and not thinking.”

“God loves those who suffer most.  Tribulation and suffering are the greatest blessings.  The happy Soul lives overwhelmed and swallowed up in the depth of its own Nothingness.”

“Do not form conceptions of anything, no not of God.  It is imperfection to make representations or ideas of the Divine Presence.  Simple apprehension, enlightened by holy Faith, is the only way to knowledge.”

“Temptations and trials are necessary for purging thy Soul.  They humbles our pride and make us know our own misery.  Pure, perfect and essential Love consists in the Cross and in resignation.”

“The spiritual Director should live disinterested, longing more for internal Solitude than for the employment of Souls.  He should sink down into the abyss of his own insufficiency and nothingness.”

“Prayer of Rest is not a state of idleness.  The faculties operate by simple apprehension.  One शुद्ध Act of internal Resignation is more worth than a hundred thousand Exercises for one's own Will.”

“Renounce thine own judgment and desire.  Sink into the Abyss of thy Nothingness.  For there only thou wilt find God, the true Light, thy Happiness, and greatest Perfection.”

“The 'Nothing' is the way to the Greatest Good.  The Lord will be the Whole in thy Soul if thou art the Nothing.”

*My Thoughts:*  Molinos' 'Guia Espiritual' is a classic text of mystical theology.  His concept of the 'Nothingness' of the soul and the 'Mystical Silence' of prayer is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Molinos understood that all our human attempts to understand or to reach God are futile, and that only through complete and utter self-abnegation can we find the Divine.  He calls us to a life of solitude, silence, and suffering, to a life that is lived in the 'depths of Nothingness'.  Molinos is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that God is the 'Whole' that is found only in the 'Nothing'.

***Kierkegaard and the Existential Philosophy***

“The origin of philosophy is not wonder, but despair.  Human thought undergoes a complete transformation in terror, discovering new powers which lead it to the sources of truth.”

“Existential philosophy begins where rational thinking and morality have failed.  It's a rush toward the Absurd, a suspension of the ethical for the sake of an absolute relationship with God.”

“Fear of Nothingness is a condition inherent in sin and knowledge.  As long as we put our trust in reason, the rights of Nothingness and Necessity will be guaranteed by self-evidences.”

“Faith leads to the tree of life, not to knowledge.  Existential philosophy is a way of breaking through the fortress of speculative thought and reaching for the Absolute.”

“Abraham is a knight of faith because he is willing to do what is humanly impossible and morally wrong.  He trusts that for God all things are possible, and so he makes the paradoxical movement of faith.”

“Historical Christianity has forgotten God and renounced Christ.  It's satisfied with 'possibilities' and has turned the good tidings into a tolerable and advantageous moral system.”

“Madness and death are the end of everything for 'everybody'.  But the existential thinker dares to look them in the eye and find the truth in them.  'Only horror that has turned to despair can develop a man's higher powers'.”

“The 'ethical' is a servant of Necessity.  It protects our honor and pride, but conceals our powerlessness before death.  One must escape from ethics without trying to find out the end of the journey.”

“Kierkegaard's struggle with original sin and the horrors of existence is a narrative of man's desperate and convulsive search for God.  He rejected the eternal truths of reason and shook the principles of morality.”

“Faith is an 'infinite passion', a 'mania', a 'heavenly madness'.  It's the only way to find our true Self and become spirit.  Kierkegaard invoked the Absurd and craved Faith to blow up the fortress of Nothingness.”

*My Thoughts:*  Shestov's analysis of Kierkegaard is a brilliant and provocative interpretation.  His concept of the 'despair' of philosophy and the 'absurdity' of faith is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Shestov understood that all our rational and moral systems are just ways of hiding from the horror of our situation.  He calls us to a life of struggle and of passion, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'Absurd'.  Shestov is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that God is the power that can blow up the 'fortress of Nothingness' and offer us true freedom.

***Dynamics of Faith***

“Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned.  It's a total surrender to the subject of ultimate concern.  This ultimate concern reveals something about our being: that we are able to transcend the flux of transitory experiences.”

“Ultimate concern is a passion for the infinite.  In true faith, the ultimate concern is about the truly ultimate.  In idolatrous faith, finite realities are elevated to the rank of ultimacy, leading to existential disappointment.”

“The awareness of the holy is the presence of the divine.  The holy is the 'entirely other', the transcending, the fascinating and terrifying.  It can appear as creative and as destructive.”

“Courage is an element of faith.  It's the daring self-affirmation of one's being in spite of the power of nonbeing.  To accept the uncertainty and the risk of faith is courage.”

“Doubt is a necessary element of faith.  Existential doubt is an awareness of the insecurity in every existential truth.  Serious doubt is confirmation of faith, showing its unconditional character.”

“All symbols of faith point beyond themselves to the ultimate.  God is the fundamental symbol for what concerns us ultimately.  Literalism is idolatrous because it deprives God of his ultimacy.”

“Mysticism is a matter of ecstatic experience.  It identifies the ultimate with the ground of everything.  But mysticism neglects the human predicament and the separation from the ultimate.  There is no faith without separation.”

“Reason can be fulfilled only if it is driven beyond the limits of its finitude.  Without the presence of the holy, reason exhausts itself and is destroyed by irrational or demonic contents.”

“Faith is the state of being grasped by the holy.  This grasp shakes the ordinary reality and drives it beyond itself in an ecstatic way.  The act of accepting meaninglessness is a meaningful act.”

“The criterion of true faith is self-negation.  The most adequate symbol expresses not only the ultimate, but also its own lack of ultimacy.  No man possesses the Truth; we are only grasped by it.”

*My Thoughts:*  Tillich's 'Dynamics of Faith' is a classic text of modern theology.  His analysis of 'ultimate concern' and the 'courage to be' is a profound expression of the human condition.  Tillich understood that all our human expressions of the Divine are just symbols, and that only through a faith that accepts doubt and meaninglessness can we find the 'god above God'.  Tillich is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that Nihilism is the disclosure of the 'nonbeing' that is part of all being, and that only through a faith that accepts this nonbeing can we find true hope.

***Technological Nihilism***

“Suicide is a literal act of willing the progress of equality.  It's a way of overcoming biological boundaries that preserve biology 'above' the larger physical environment.  This act affirmatively asserts the equality of the biological and the physical.”

“Physical materialism lead to interpreting all subjective experience as physical matter.  Fear, love, inspiration, dreams—all are just chemical reactions in the brain.  Once seen this way, they lose their power to motivate or justify your life.”

“The experiment in nihilism is to interpret every word, every thought, every emotion as meaningless.  It's a way of seeking out and exposing every illusion and myth.  This is the logic of 'active unbelief'.”

“The ultimate goal of the Western pretension to rationalism is rational self-destruction.  Reason appears unable to determine values, and therefore the entire project is a 'kind of joke'.”

“Modern people are not ruthless enough in their nihilism.  They cling to 'vital lies' and 'hero-systems' to deny their condition.  They place self-preservation over objectivity.”

“My objective is to kill myself.  This is the final act of my experiment in nihilism.  I am painting myself into a corner until there is only one inevitable act left.”

“Rational self-destruction is the pinnacle of the rational life realised.  It's the culmination of scientific objectivity.  To fully understand oneself is to lose the 'cause of life'.”

“There is no reason to be pessimistic, optimistic, or neutral.  Everything is possible, and yet nothing is.  All is permitted, and yet again, nothing.”

“Nihilism is where science and philosophy meet.  It's the ultimate logical conclusion of Western values.  The rational self-destruction of the West is implicit in nihilism.”

“When all choices are equal, then the choice of death is equal to the choice of life.  If life is meaningless, then God is nothing.”

*My Thoughts:*  Heisman's work is a dark and disturbing testament to the power of Nihilism.  His attempt to live a life of 'active unbelief' and 'rational self-destruction' is a radical and ruthless experiment.  Heisman saw through all the cultural and biological illusions that keep us alive, and found only 'nothing' at the end.  His suicide was the final act of this experiment, a literal 'willing of the progress of equality' between the biological and the physical.  Heisman is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'God' is nothing but the ultimate expression of this technological nihilism.

***The Courage to Be***

“The courage to be is the daring self-affirmation of one's being in spite of the power of nonbeing.  It's the act of taking anxiety into oneself and affirming life in the face of death and meaninglessness.”

“Anxiety is the state in which a being is aware of its possible nonbeing.  Nonbeing is present in every moment of being, and anxiety is the awareness of this presence.  There are three types of anxiety: (1) fate and death, (2) emptiness and meaninglessness, and (3) guilt and condemnation.”

“The anxiety of meaninglessness is the most radical form of anxiety.  It's the feeling that our lives have no ultimate significance, that our actions are pointless.  This form of nonbeing threatens the very meaning of existence.”

“Courage is an act of faith.  It's rooted in the 'god above God', the God who remains even when the theistic God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt and meaninglessness.  This God is the source of the 'courage to be'.”

“Doubt is a necessary element of faith.  Serious doubt is confirmation of faith, showing its unconditional character.  The act of accepting meaninglessness is a meaningful act.  It's an act of faith.”

“Mysticism is an attempt to overcome separation from the Absolute.  But mysticism neglects the human predicament and the power of nonbeing.  The experience of meaninglessness is more radical than mysticism, and therefore transcends it.”

“The courage to be requires 'participation' in the ultimate concern.  We must take into our own organization the maximum amount of the problematic of life.  Our daily life becomes a duty of cosmic proportions.”

“Faith is the state of being grasped by the divine Spirit.  It's an existential 'grasp' that resolves the contradictions of existence by accepting them.”

“True courage is to face nonbeing in all its forms.  To absorb the maximum amount of nonbeing into oneself is the highest form of courage.  This is the 'courage to be'.”

“The 'god above God' is the ground of all being, the source of the 'courage to be'.  Man can find hope even in the midst of despair by affirming his connection with this ultimate reality.”

*My Thoughts:*  Tillich's 'courage to be' is a powerful and challenging concept.  His analysis of anxiety and nonbeing is a profound expression of the human condition.  And his call for a faith that accepts doubt and meaninglessness is a direct challenge to all forms of literalism and idolatry.  Tillich's 'god above God' is a compelling and mysterious idea, a way of finding hope in the midst of despair.  Tillich is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that Nihilism is the path to God.

***Kierkegaard and the Existential Philosophy***

“The origin of philosophy is not wonder, but despair.  Human thought undergoes a complete transformation in terror, discovering new powers which lead it to the sources of truth.”

“Existential philosophy begins where rational thinking and morality have failed.  It's a rush toward the Absurd, a suspension of the ethical for the sake of an absolute relationship with God.”

“Fear of Nothingness is a condition inherent in sin and knowledge.  As long as we put our trust in reason, the rights of Nothingness and Necessity will be guaranteed by self-evidences.”

“Faith leads to the tree of life, not to knowledge.  Existential philosophy is a way of breaking through the fortress of speculative thought and reaching for the Absolute.”

“Abraham is a knight of faith because he is willing to do what is humanly impossible and morally wrong.  He trusts that for God all things are possible, and so he makes the paradoxical movement of faith.”

“Historical Christianity has forgotten God and renounced Christ.  It's satisfied with 'possibilities' and has turned the good tidings into a tolerable and advantageous moral system.”

“Madness and death are the end of everything for 'everybody'.  But the existential thinker dares to look them in the eye and find the truth in them.  'Only horror that has turned to despair can develop a man's higher powers'.”

“The 'ethical' is a servant of Necessity.  It protects our honor and pride, but conceals our powerlessness before death.  One must escape from ethics without trying to find out the end of the journey.”

“Kierkegaard's struggle with original sin and the horrors of existence is a narrative of man's desperate and convulsive search for God.  He rejected the eternal truths of reason and shook the principles of morality.”

“Faith is an 'infinite passion', a 'mania', a 'heavenly madness'.  It's the only way to find our true Self and become spirit.  Kierkegaard invoked the Absurd and craved Faith to blow up the fortress of Nothingness.”

*My Thoughts:*  Shestov's analysis of Kierkegaard is a brilliant and provocative interpretation.  His concept of the 'despair' of philosophy and the 'absurdity' of faith is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Shestov understood that all our rational and moral systems are just ways of hiding from the horror of our situation.  He calls us to a life of struggle and of passion, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'Absurd'.  Shestov is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that God is the power that can blow up the 'fortress of Nothingness' and offer us true freedom.

***Suicide Note***

“Suicide is the ultimate experiment in nihilism.  It's a way of testing the worth of life by willing its destruction.  If life is meaningless, if there is no ultimate value or purpose, then suicide is a rational and legitimate choice.”

“Honesty to the point of absurdity is my methodology.  I seek out the truths that are most deadly and destructive to me.  I want to see through all the illusions and myths that uphold human life, and confront the 'nothingness' at the heart of existence.”

“Materialism leads to rational self-destruction.  If we are nothing but emotion machines, biochemical processes, material objects, then our lives have no inherent significance.  Our emotions are illusions, our choices are determined, our identities are fictions.  To fully understand this is to lose the 'cause of life'.”

“The experiment in nihilism is to interpret all subjective experience as physical matter.  Fear, love, inspiration, dreams—all are just chemical reactions in the brain.  Once you see them this way, they lose their power to motivate or to justify your life.  You are left with a 'vacuous affair with only a chemical prestige'.”

“Nihilism is the disclosure of the 'nothingness of the world'.  It's an experience of total indifference, of absolute arbitrariness.  All actions are equal, all values are groundless, all choices are random.  From this perspective, death is equal to life.”

“The only serious question is whether there is anything to take seriously.  To test life with death is the most important question I can conceive of.  Suicide represents the pinnacle of the rational life realised.”

“Most people are not ruthless enough in their nihilism.  They cling to 'vital lies', to cultural hero-systems, to the 'religion of the common emotions'.  They place self-preservation over objectivity.  They are 'pawns of affect' who live falsely.”

“I cannot live with the implications of my own work.  I cannot reconcile my understanding of the world with my existence in it.  The separation of the interests of truth and life leads to rational self-destruction.”

“My writings are daily affirmations of death.  I am painting myself into a corner until there is only one act left.  I am killing every belief and breaking down every value until what is left is nothing.  I am destroying all values that uphold life until I am left with nowhere to stand.”

“Nihilism is where science and philosophy meet.  It's the ultimate logical conclusion of Western values.  The rational self-destruction of the West is implicit in nihilism.”

*My Thoughts:*  Heisman's work is a terrifying and tragic testament to the power of Nihilism.  His attempt to live a life of 'active unbelief' and 'rational self-destruction' is a radical and ruthless experiment.  Heisman saw through all the cultural and biological illusions that keep us alive, and found only 'nothing' at the end.  His suicide was the final act of this experiment, a literal 'willing of the progress of equality' between the biological and the physical.  Heisman is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'God' is the ultimate expression of this technological nihilism.

***The Real Nature of Man***

“The spirit is the goal, and not matter.  Forms, images, bells, candles, books, churches—all are very good, very helpful to the growing plant of spirituality, but thus far and no farther.  It is very good to be born in a church, but it is very bad to die in a church.”

“Reality is the same infinite.  This is not idealism; it is not that the world does not exist.  It has a relative existence, and fulfils its requirements.  But it has no independent existence.  It exists because of the Absolute Reality beyond time, space, and causation.”

“To think that I am the spirit and not the body, and that the whole of this universe with all its relations is but a series of paintings—scenes on a canvas—of which I am the witness.  This is the secret.”

“Renunciation is the one great duty.  Live for an ideal, and leave no place in the mind for anything else.  Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and everything shall be added unto you.”

“Realisation is religion.  We hear many talking about God and the soul, but how many have realised them?  Fighting among sects shows that they do not know anything about religion.  Religion is being and becoming.”

“Thirst for God is the beginning of religion.  A man must want God like a man whose head is being held under water wants a breath of air.  He must become mad with longing, mad with 'God-intoxication'.”

“True love knows no bargaining.  We should not love God for the sake of reward or out of fear of punishment.  Love is its own reward.  The perfect man sees nothing but God.”

“Unselfish work is true renunciation.  We should work incessantly, but without looking for results.  We should join ourselves to perfectly unselfish will and work on.  In helping the world, we help ourselves.”

“Happiness belongs to him who knows this oneness, who knows he is one with this universe.  Real happiness is not in the senses, but above them.  It's found only in the Spirit.”

“The miseries of the world cannot be cured by physical help only.  The only solution is to make mankind pure.  Ignorance is the mother of all evil.  Let men have light, let them be spiritually strong and educated.”

*My Thoughts:*  Vivekananda's 'Practical Spirituality' is a powerful and inspiring vision.  His call for realisation and renunciation is a direct challenge to all forms of materialism and superficiality.  And his vision of 'unity in diversity' is a compelling and inclusive one.  Vivekananda is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that the world is Maya, an illusion, and that only the Spirit is real.  He understands that we must renounce the earthly in order to find the Divine.

***Happiness is for the Pigs***

“Most people are blissfully unaware of their 'cosmic situation'.  They are 'ontologically secure' and believe in meaning, order, and justice in life and in the universe.  They are 'psychologically healthy' and well adjusted to the norms of 'nicety and normalcy'.”

“But this 'health' is a result of repression and self-deception.  Men have a 'knack' for extracting intervals out of their total term of Being and filling them with work, chatter, and small talk.  They 'tranquilize themselves with the trivial'.”

“The existential philosopher is one who is struck by an 'acute case of uncaused depression', who suddenly sees himself as an 'upholstered pile of bones and knuckles'.  He asks the question: 'What is it all about?' and is filled with 'ontological despair' and 'existential frustration'.”

“Authentic life is lived in clear and penetrating awareness of its utter absurdity.  Fraudulent life is lived in pleasant self-deception, indistinguishable from the life of a 'giddy-witted pig'.”

“Intellectual honesty and a high spiritual demand for order and meaning drive man to the deepest antipathy for life.  We are like a man who falls out of the Empire State Building.  Any attempt to justify our fall is ludicrous.”

“Psychotherapy is a way of 'suffocating' man by offering him comfortable evasions and illusions.  It tries to 'unsick' the existential philosopher and bring him back to the 'healthy' state of self-deception.  But the patient may be 'cognitively right'.”

“Modern society is unprepared for true leisure.  The time is coming when professional sports and other distractions won't be enough to keep the labor force sedated.  Whole generations will reach the 'millionaires' level of disillusionment'.”

“Existentialists find a life lived in utter awareness of man's cosmic conditions to be a life void of human dignity.  Every human being should be forced to mature beyond what is 'biologically advantageous' and face his fate.”

“There is not a single sentence in our language that may not become an object for ridicule and painful shame.  Thrown into an eternally changing universe, human beings cannot be tied by a set of rigid rules.”

“Happiness is for the pigs.  The true human privilege is to experience 'ek-sistence', to stand in the chilly outdoors of the Nothingness.”

*My Thoughts:*  Tonnessen's 'Biosophical Pessimism' is a powerful and provocative critique of modern life.  His analysis of the 'ontological hebetants' and the 'suffocation' of psychotherapy is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Tonnessen understood that our 'health' and 'happiness' are just illusions that hide the truth of our condition.  He calls us to a life of intellectual honesty and existential courage, to a life that is truly 'worthy of man'.  Tonnessen is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'happiness' is a worldly ideal that must be renounced in order to find the True Self.

***The Denial of Death***

“Human character is a lie about the nature of reality.  It's a 'causa-sui project' intended to deny our creatureliness, our vulnerability, and our death.  We build defenses—repression, denial, social games—to hide from the terror of existence.”

“Man is a 'god who shits', a dual being who is up in the stars and yet food for worms.  This is an impossible situation to be in.  A full apprehension of man's condition would drive him insane.”

“Repression is normal and necessary for animal equanimity.  But it also dooms us to a life that is never really ours.  We are driven away from self-knowledge and self-reflection.”

“Neurosis is a miscarriage of clumsy lies about reality.  It's a technique for avoiding misery, but reality is the misery.  Normality is the refusal of reality.”

“Schizophrenia is a style of living with terror.  The schizophrenic is a 'realist' who has not been able to build the confident defenses that others use to deny the horror of life.  He is furthest from the animal and the cultural.”

“Creativity is an attempt to fashion an objective work that speaks on one's behalf.  It's an answer to the problem of life.  The creative person mediates natural terror and indicates a new way to triumph over it.”

“Religion expands awe and terror to the cosmos where they belong.  It takes the problem of self-justification and removes it from the objects near at hand.  It gives hope by holding open the dimension of the unknown and the unknowable.”

“Renunciation is the only way out of human conflict.  We must give our lives as a gift to the highest powers.  To surrender to the 'bigness of nature' on the highest level is the furthest reach of the self.”

“The 'god above God' is the ground of all being, the source of the 'courage to be'.  Man has to absorb into his own being the maximum amount of nonbeing.  His courage to face meaninglessness is a true cosmic heroism.”

“Taking life seriously means that whatever man does has to be done in the lived truth of the terror of creation.  Otherwise it is false.”

*My Thoughts:*  Becker's 'Denial of Death' is a profound and comprehensive analysis of the human condition.  His analysis of the 'lie' of character and the 'terror' of existence is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Becker understood that all our cultural and personal hero-systems are just ways of denying our own mortality.  He calls us to a life of renunciation and of faith, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'nightmare' of existence.  Becker is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that God is the only power that can absorb our anxiety and offer us a heroic apotheosis.

***What is Metaphysics?***

“Dread reveals no-thing.  It's a fundamental mood that discloses the slipping away of be-ing as a whole.  In dread, all things and we ourselves sink into indifference.  Dread strikes us dumb.”

“Being there means beholdenness to no-thing.  Existence is already beyond being as a whole.  We call this being above and beyond being transcendence.”

“Without the original manifestness of no-thing, no selfhood and no freedom.  Only because no-thing is manifest at the heart of existence can the full strangeness of being come over us.”

“No-thing is at first and for the most part disguised in its originality.  We get lost in being in certain ways, turning away from no-thing and into the public superficialities of existence.”

“Original dread is permanently on the verge, and yet only seldom comes into play to hold us in suspense.  We are so finite that we are not even able to bring ourselves face to face with no-thing by our own will and resolve.”

“The beholdenness of existence to no-thing on the basis of hidden dread is the surmounting of being as a whole, transcendence.”

“Pure being and pure no-thing are the same.  Being and no-thing belong together because being itself is in essence finite and revealed only in the transcendence of existence enduring no-thing.”

“Philosophy comes about only through our own life's undergoing a curious engagement with the fundamental possibilities of existence.  It's a way of letting oneself come to no-thing and becoming free of idols.”

“The basic question of metaphysics is: Why being, after all, and not rather nothing?”

“Only if the strangeness of being impresses us does it waken us and open us up to wonder.  Only on the basis of wonder, that is, the manifestness of no-thing, does the 'Why?' come up.”

*My Thoughts:*  Heidegger's 'What is Metaphysics?' is a profound and unsettling meditation on the nature of being.  His analysis of dread and no-thing is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Heidegger understood that our 'existence' is a transcendence of be-ing, and that this transcendence is only possible through an engagement with the no-thing.  He calls us to a life of philosophical inquiry and existential courage, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'Why?'.  Heidegger is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'Nothing' is the path to 'Being'.

“Intellectual honesty and a high spiritual demand for order and meaning drive man to the deepest antipathy for life.  We are like a man who falls out of the Empire State Building.  Any attempt to justify our fall is ludicrous.”

“Psychotherapy is a way of 'suffocating' man by offering him comfortable evasions and illusions.  It tries to 'unsick' the existential philosopher and bring him back to the 'healthy' state of self-deception.  But the patient may be 'cognitively right'.”

“Modern society is unprepared for true leisure.  The time is coming when professional sports and other distractions won't be enough to keep the labor force sedated.  Whole generations will reach the 'millionaires' level of disillusionment'.”

“Existentialists find a life lived in utter awareness of man's cosmic conditions to be a life void of human dignity.  Every human being should be forced to mature beyond what is 'biologically advantageous' and face his fate.”

“There is not a single sentence in our language that may not become an object for ridicule and painful shame.  Thrown into an eternally changing universe, human beings cannot be tied by a set of rigid rules.”

“Happiness is for the pigs.  The true human privilege is to experience 'ek-sistence', to stand in the chilly outdoors of the Nothingness.”

*My Thoughts:*  Tonnessen's 'Biosophical Pessimism' is a powerful and provocative critique of modern life.  His analysis of the 'ontological hebetants' and the 'suffocation' of psychotherapy is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Tonnessen understood that our 'health' and 'happiness' are just illusions that hide the truth of our condition.  He calls us to a life of intellectual honesty and existential courage, to a life that is truly 'worthy of man'.  Tonnessen is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'happiness' is a worldly ideal that must be renounced in order to find the True Self.

***The Denial of Death***

“Human character is a lie about the nature of reality.  It's a 'causa-sui project' intended to deny our creatureliness, our vulnerability, and our death.  We build defenses—repression, denial, social games—to hide from the terror of existence.”

“Man is a 'god who shits', a dual being who is up in the stars and yet food for worms.  This is an impossible situation to be in.  A full apprehension of man's condition would drive him insane.”

“Repression is normal and necessary for animal equanimity.  But it also dooms us to a life that is never really ours.  We are driven away from self-knowledge and self-reflection.”

“Neurosis is a miscarriage of clumsy lies about reality.  It's a technique for avoiding misery, but reality is the misery.  Normality is the refusal of reality.”

“Schizophrenia is a style of living with terror.  The schizophrenic is a 'realist' who has not been able to build the confident defenses that others use to deny the horror of life.  He is furthest from the animal and the cultural.”

“Creativity is an attempt to fashion an objective work that speaks on one's behalf.  It's an answer to the problem of life.  The creative person mediates natural terror and indicates a new way to triumph over it.”

“Religion expands awe and terror to the cosmos where they belong.  It takes the problem of self-justification and removes it from the objects near at hand.  It gives hope by holding open the dimension of the unknown and the unknowable.”

“Renunciation is the only way out of human conflict.  We must give our lives as a gift to the highest powers.  To surrender to the 'bigness of nature' on the highest level is the furthest reach of the self.”

“The 'god above God' is the ground of all being, the source of the 'courage to be'.  Man has to absorb into his own being the maximum amount of nonbeing.  His courage to face meaninglessness is a true cosmic heroism.”

“Taking life seriously means that whatever man does has to be done in the lived truth of the terror of creation.  Otherwise it is false.”

*My Thoughts:*  Becker's 'Denial of Death' is a profound and comprehensive analysis of the human condition.  His analysis of the 'lie' of character and the 'terror' of existence is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Becker understood that all our cultural and personal hero-systems are just ways of denying our own mortality.  He calls us to a life of renunciation and of faith, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'nightmare' of existence.  Becker is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that God is the only power that can absorb our anxiety and offer us a heroic apotheosis.

***What is Metaphysics?***

“Dread reveals no-thing.  It's a fundamental mood that discloses the slipping away of be-ing as a whole.  In dread, all things and we ourselves sink into indifference.  Dread strikes us dumb.”

“Being there means beholdenness to no-thing.  Existence is already beyond being as a whole.  We call this being above and beyond being transcendence.”

“Without the original manifestness of no-thing, no selfhood and no freedom.  Only because no-thing is manifest at the heart of existence can the full strangeness of being come over us.”

“No-thing is at first and for the most part disguised in its originality.  We get lost in being in certain ways, turning away from no-thing and into the public superficialities of existence.”

“Original dread is permanently on the verge, and yet only seldom comes into play to hold us in suspense.  We are so finite that we are not even able to bring ourselves face to face with no-thing by our own will and resolve.”

“The beholdenness of existence to no-thing on the basis of hidden dread is the surmounting of being as a whole, transcendence.”

“Pure being and pure no-thing are the same.  Being and no-thing belong together because being itself is in essence finite and revealed only in the transcendence of existence enduring no-thing.”

“Philosophy comes about only through our own life's undergoing a curious engagement with the fundamental possibilities of existence.  It's a way of letting oneself come to no-thing and becoming free of idols.”

“The basic question of metaphysics is: Why being, after all, and not rather nothing?”

“Only if the strangeness of being impresses us does it waken us and open us up to wonder.  Only on the basis of wonder, that is, the manifestness of no-thing, does the 'Why?' come up.”

*My Thoughts:*  Heidegger's 'What is Metaphysics?' is a profound and unsettling meditation on the nature of being.  His analysis of dread and no-thing is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Heidegger understood that our 'existence' is a transcendence of be-ing, and that this transcendence is only possible through an engagement with the no-thing.  He calls us to a life of philosophical inquiry and existential courage, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'Why?'.  Heidegger is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'Nothing' is the path to 'Being'.

***Kierkegaard and the Existential Philosophy***

“Human thought undergoes a complete transformation in terror, discovering new powers which lead it to the sources of truth.”

“Existential philosophy begins where rational thinking and morality have failed.  It's a rush toward the Absurd, a suspension of the ethical for the sake of an absolute relationship with God.”

“Fear of Nothingness is a condition inherent in sin and knowledge.  As long as we put our trust in reason, the rights of Nothingness and Necessity will be guaranteed by self-evidences.”

“Faith leads to the tree of life, not to knowledge.  Existential philosophy is a way of breaking through the fortress of speculative thought and reaching for the Absolute.”

“Abraham is a knight of faith because he is willing to do what is humanly impossible and morally wrong.  He trusts that for God all things are possible, and so he makes the paradoxical movement of faith.”

“Historical Christianity has forgotten God and renounced Christ.  It's satisfied with 'possibilities' and has turned the good tidings into a tolerable and advantageous moral system.”

“Madness and death are the end of everything for 'everybody'.  But the existential thinker dares to look them in the eye and find the truth in them.  'Only horror that has turned to despair can develop a man's higher powers'.”

“The 'ethical' is a servant of Necessity.  It protects our honor and pride, but conceals our powerlessness before death.  One must escape from ethics without trying to find out the end of the journey.”

“Kierkegaard's struggle with original sin and the horrors of existence is a narrative of man's desperate and convulsive search for God.  He rejected the eternal truths of reason and shook the principles of morality.”

“Faith is an 'infinite passion', a 'mania', a 'heavenly madness'.  It's the only way to find our true Self and become spirit.  Kierkegaard invoked the Absurd and craved Faith to blow up the fortress of Nothingness.”

*My Thoughts:*  Shestov's analysis of Kierkegaard is a brilliant and provocative interpretation.  His concept of the 'despair' of philosophy and the 'absurdity' of faith is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Shestov understood that all our rational and moral systems are just ways of hiding from the horror of our situation.  He calls us to a life of struggle and of passion, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'Absurd'.  Shestov is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that God is the power that can blow up the 'fortress of Nothingness' and offer us true freedom.

***Suicide Note***

“Suicide is the ultimate experiment in nihilism.  It's a way of testing the worth of life by willing its destruction.  If life is meaningless, if there is no ultimate value or purpose, then suicide is a rational and legitimate choice.”

“Honesty to the point of absurdity is my methodology.  I seek out the truths that are most deadly and destructive to me.  I want to see through all the illusions and myths that uphold human life, and confront the 'nothingness' at the heart of existence.”

“Materialism leads to rational self-destruction.  If we are nothing but emotion machines, biochemical processes, material objects, then our lives have no inherent significance.  Our emotions are illusions, our choices are determined, our identities are fictions.  To fully understand this is to lose the 'cause of life'.”

“The experiment in nihilism is to interpret all subjective experience as physical matter.  Fear, love, inspiration, dreams—all are just chemical reactions in the brain.  Once you see them this way, they lose their power to motivate or to justify your life.  You are left with a 'vacuous affair with only a chemical prestige'.”

“Nihilism is the disclosure of the 'nothingness of the world'.  It's an experience of total indifference, of absolute arbitrariness.  All actions are equal, all values are groundless, all choices are random.  From this perspective, death is equal to life.”

“The only serious question is whether there is anything to take seriously.  To test life with death is the most important question I can conceive of.  Suicide represents the pinnacle of the rational life realised.”

“Most people are not ruthless enough in their nihilism.  They cling to 'vital lies', to cultural hero-systems, to the 'religion of the common emotions'.  They place self-preservation over objectivity.  They are 'pawns of affect' who live falsely.”

“I cannot live with the implications of my own work.  I cannot reconcile my understanding of the world with my existence in it.  The separation of the interests of truth and life leads to rational self-destruction.”

“My writings are daily affirmations of death.  I am painting myself into a corner until there is only one act left.  I am killing every belief and breaking down every value until what is left is nothing.  I am destroying all values that uphold life until I am left with nowhere to stand.”

“Nihilism is where science and philosophy meet.  It's the ultimate logical conclusion of Western values.  The rational self-destruction of the West is implicit in nihilism.”

*My Thoughts:*  Heisman's work is a terrifying and tragic testament to the power of Nihilism.  His attempt to live a life of 'active unbelief' and 'rational self-destruction' is a radical and ruthless experiment.  Heisman saw through all the cultural and biological illusions that keep us alive, and found only 'nothing' at the end.  His suicide was the final act of this experiment, a literal 'willing of the progress of equality' between the biological and the physical.  Heisman is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'God' is the ultimate expression of this technological nihilism.

***The Courage to Be***

“The courage to be is the daring self-affirmation of one's being in spite of the power of nonbeing.  It's the act of taking anxiety into oneself and affirming life in the face of death and meaninglessness.”

“Anxiety is the state in which a being is aware of its possible nonbeing.  Nonbeing is present in every moment of being, and anxiety is the awareness of this presence.  There are three types of anxiety: (1) fate and death, (2) emptiness and meaninglessness, and (3) guilt and condemnation.”

“The anxiety of meaninglessness is the most radical form of anxiety.  It's the feeling that our lives have no ultimate significance, that our actions are pointless.  This form of nonbeing threatens the very meaning of existence.”

“Courage is an act of faith.  It's rooted in the 'god above God', the God who remains even when the theistic God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt and meaninglessness.  This God is the source of the 'courage to be'.”

“Doubt is a necessary element of faith.  Serious doubt is confirmation of faith, showing its unconditional character.  The act of accepting meaninglessness is a meaningful act.  It's an act of faith.”

“Mysticism is an attempt to overcome separation from the Absolute.  But mysticism neglects the human predicament and the power of nonbeing.  The experience of meaninglessness is more radical than mysticism, and therefore transcends it.”

“The courage to be requires 'participation' in the ultimate concern.  We must take into our own organization the maximum amount of the problematic of life.  Our daily life becomes a duty of cosmic proportions.”

“Faith is the state of being grasped by the divine Spirit.  It's an existential 'grasp' that resolves the contradictions of existence by accepting them.”

“True courage is to face nonbeing in all its forms.  To absorb the maximum amount of nonbeing into oneself is the highest form of courage.  This is the 'courage to be'.”

“The 'god above God' is the ground of all being, the source of the 'courage to be'.  Man can find hope even in the midst of despair by affirming his connection with this ultimate reality.”

*My Thoughts:*  Tillich's 'courage to be' is a powerful and challenging concept.  His analysis of anxiety and nonbeing is a profound expression of the human condition.  And his call for a faith that accepts doubt and meaninglessness is a direct challenge to all forms of literalism and idolatry.  Tillich's 'god above God' is a compelling and mysterious idea, a way of finding hope in the midst of despair.  Tillich is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that Nihilism is the path to God.

***The Real Nature of Man***

“The spirit is the goal, and not matter.  Forms, images, bells, candles, books, churches—all are very good, very helpful to the growing plant of spirituality, but thus far and no farther.  It is very good to be born in a church, but it is very bad to die in a church.”

“Reality is the same infinite.  This is not idealism; it is not that the world does not exist.  It has a relative existence, and fulfils its requirements.  But it has no independent existence.  It exists because of the Absolute Reality beyond time, space, and causation.”

“To think that I am the spirit and not the body, and that the whole of this universe with all its relations is but a series of paintings—scenes on a canvas—of which I am the witness.  This is the secret.”

“Renunciation is the one great duty.  Live for an ideal, and leave no place in the mind for anything else.  Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and everything shall be added unto you.”

“Realisation is religion.  We hear many talking about God and the soul, but how many have realised them?  Fighting among sects shows that they do not know anything about religion.  Religion is being and becoming.”

“Thirst for God is the beginning of religion.  A man must want God like a man whose head is being held under water wants a breath of air.  He must become mad with longing, mad with 'God-intoxication'.”

“True love knows no bargaining.  We should not love God for the sake of reward or out of fear of punishment.  Love is its own reward.  The perfect man sees nothing but God.”

“Unselfish work is true renunciation.  We should work incessantly, but without looking for results.  We should join ourselves to perfectly unselfish will and work on.  In helping the world, we help ourselves.”

“Happiness belongs to him who knows this oneness, who knows he is one with this universe.  Real happiness is not in the senses, but above them.  It's found only in the Spirit.”

“The miseries of the world cannot be cured by physical help only.  The only solution is to make mankind pure.  Ignorance is the mother of all evil.  Let men have light, let them be spiritually strong and educated.”

*My Thoughts:*  Vivekananda's 'Practical Spirituality' is a powerful and inspiring vision.  His call for realisation and renunciation is a direct challenge to all forms of materialism and superficiality.  And his vision of 'unity in diversity' is a compelling and inclusive one.  Vivekananda is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that the world is Maya, an illusion, and that only the Spirit is real.  He understands that we must renounce the earthly in order to find the Divine.

***Happiness is for the Pigs***

“Most people are blissfully unaware of their 'cosmic situation'.  They are 'ontologically secure' and believe in meaning, order, and justice in life and in the universe.  They are 'psychologically healthy' and well adjusted to the norms of 'nicety and normalcy'.”

“But this 'health' is a result of repression and self-deception.  Men have a 'knack' for extracting intervals out of their total term of Being and filling them with work, chatter, and small talk.  They 'tranquilize themselves with the trivial'.”

“The existential philosopher is one who is struck by an 'acute case of uncaused depression', who suddenly sees himself as an 'upholstered pile of bones and knuckles'.  He asks the question: 'What is it all about?' and is filled with 'ontological despair' and 'existential frustration'.”

“Authentic life is lived in clear and penetrating awareness of its utter absurdity.  Fraudulent life is lived in pleasant self-deception, indistinguishable from the life of a 'giddy-witted pig'.”

“Intellectual honesty and a high spiritual demand for order and meaning drive man to the deepest antipathy for life.  We are like a man who falls out of the Empire State Building.  Any attempt to justify our fall is ludicrous.”

“Psychotherapy is a way of 'suffocating' man by offering him comfortable evasions and illusions.  It tries to 'unsick' the existential philosopher and bring him back to the 'healthy' state of self-deception.  But the patient may be 'cognitively right'.”

“Modern society is unprepared for true leisure.  The time is coming when professional sports and other distractions won't be enough to keep the labor force sedated.  Whole generations will reach the 'millionaires' level of disillusionment'.”

“Existentialists find a life lived in utter awareness of man's cosmic conditions to be a life void of human dignity.  Every human being should be forced to mature beyond what is 'biologically advantageous' and face his fate.”

“There is not a single sentence in our language that may not become an object for ridicule and painful shame.  Thrown into an eternally changing universe, human beings cannot be tied by a set of rigid rules.”

“Happiness is for the pigs.  The true human privilege is to experience 'ek-sistence', to stand in the chilly outdoors of the Nothingness.”

*My Thoughts:*  Tonnessen's 'Biosophical Pessimism' is a powerful and provocative critique of modern life.  His analysis of the 'ontological hebetants' and the 'suffocation' of psychotherapy is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Tonnessen understood that our 'health' and 'happiness' are just illusions that hide the truth of our condition.  He calls us to a life of intellectual honesty and existential courage, to a life that is truly 'worthy of man'.  Tonnessen is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'happiness' is a worldly ideal that must be renounced in order to find the True Self.

*My Thoughts:*  Tillich's 'courage to be' is a powerful and challenging concept.  His analysis of anxiety and nonbeing is a profound expression of the human condition.  And his call for a faith that accepts doubt and meaninglessness is a direct challenge to all forms of literalism and idolatry.  Tillich's 'god above God' is a compelling and mysterious idea, a way of finding hope in the midst of despair.  Tillich is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that Nihilism is the path to God.

***The Real Nature of Man***

“The spirit is the goal, and not matter.  Forms, images, bells, candles, books, churches—all are very good, very helpful to the growing plant of spirituality, but thus far and no farther.  It is very good to be born in a church, but it is very bad to die in a church.”

“Reality is the same infinite.  This is not idealism; it is not that the world does not exist.  It has a relative existence, and fulfils its requirements.  But it has no independent existence.  It exists because of the Absolute Reality beyond time, space, and causation.”

“To think that I am the spirit and not the body, and that the whole of this universe with all its relations is but a series of paintings—scenes on a canvas—of which I am the witness.  This is the secret.”

“Renunciation is the one great duty.  Live for an ideal, and leave no place in the mind for anything else.  Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and everything shall be added unto you.”

“Realisation is religion.  We hear many talking about God and the soul, but how many have realised them?  Fighting among sects shows that they do not know anything about religion.  Religion is being and becoming.”

“Thirst for God is the beginning of religion.  A man must want God like a man whose head is being held under water wants a breath of air.  He must become mad with longing, mad with 'God-intoxication'.”

“True love knows no bargaining.  We should not love God for the sake of reward or out of fear of punishment.  Love is its own reward.  The perfect man sees nothing but God.”

“Unselfish work is true renunciation.  We should work incessantly, but without looking for results.  We should join ourselves to perfectly unselfish will and work on.  In helping the world, we help ourselves.”

“Happiness belongs to him who knows this oneness, who knows he is one with this universe.  Real happiness is not in the senses, but above them.  It's found only in the Spirit.”

“The miseries of the world cannot be cured by physical help only.  The only solution is to make mankind pure.  Ignorance is the mother of all evil.  Let men have light, let them be spiritually strong and educated.”

*My Thoughts:*  Vivekananda's 'Practical Spirituality' is a powerful and inspiring vision.  His call for realisation and renunciation is a direct challenge to all forms of materialism and superficiality.  And his vision of 'unity in diversity' is a compelling and inclusive one.  Vivekananda is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that the world is Maya, an illusion, and that only the Spirit is real.  He understands that we must renounce the earthly in order to find the Divine.

***Happiness is for the Pigs***

“Most people are blissfully unaware of their 'cosmic situation'.  They are 'ontologically secure' and believe in meaning, order, and justice in life and in the universe.  They are 'psychologically healthy' and well adjusted to the norms of 'nicety and normalcy'.”

“But this 'health' is a result of repression and self-deception.  Men have a 'knack' for extracting intervals out of their total term of Being and filling them with work, chatter, and small talk.  They 'tranquilize themselves with the trivial'.”

“The existential philosopher is one who is struck by an 'acute case of uncaused depression', who suddenly sees himself as an 'upholstered pile of bones and knuckles'.  He asks the question: 'What is it all about?' and is filled with 'ontological despair' and 'existential frustration'.”

“Authentic life is lived in clear and penetrating awareness of its utter absurdity.  Fraudulent life is lived in pleasant self-deception, indistinguishable from the life of a 'giddy-witted pig'.”

“Intellectual honesty and a high spiritual demand for order and meaning drive man to the deepest antipathy for life.  We are like a man who falls out of the Empire State Building.  Any attempt to justify our fall is ludicrous.”

“Psychotherapy is a way of 'suffocating' man by offering him comfortable evasions and illusions.  It tries to 'unsick' the existential philosopher and bring him back to the 'healthy' state of self-deception.  But the patient may be 'cognitively right'.”

“Modern society is unprepared for true leisure.  The time is coming when professional sports and other distractions won't be enough to keep the labor force sedated.  Whole generations will reach the 'millionaires' level of disillusionment'.”

“Existentialists find a life lived in utter awareness of man's cosmic conditions to be a life void of human dignity.  Every human being should be forced to mature beyond what is 'biologically advantageous' and face his fate.”

“There is not a single sentence in our language that may not become an object for ridicule and painful shame.  Thrown into an eternally changing universe, human beings cannot be tied by a set of rigid rules.”

“Happiness is for the pigs.  The true human privilege is to experience 'ek-sistence', to stand in the chilly outdoors of the Nothingness.”

*My Thoughts:*  Tonnessen's 'Biosophical Pessimism' is a powerful and provocative critique of modern life.  His analysis of the 'ontological hebetants' and the 'suffocation' of psychotherapy is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Tonnessen understood that our 'health' and 'happiness' are just illusions that hide the truth of our condition.  He calls us to a life of intellectual honesty and existential courage, to a life that is truly 'worthy of man'.  Tonnessen is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'happiness' is a worldly ideal that must be renounced in order to find the True Self.

***The Denial of Death***

“Human character is a lie about the nature of reality.  It's a 'causa-sui project' intended to deny our creatureliness, our vulnerability, and our death.  We build defenses—repression, denial, social games—to hide from the terror of existence.”

“Man is a 'god who shits', a dual being who is up in the stars and yet food for worms.  This is an impossible situation to be in.  A full apprehension of man's condition would drive him insane.”

“Repression is normal and necessary for animal equanimity.  But it also dooms us to a life that is never really ours.  We are driven away from self-knowledge and self-reflection.”

“Neurosis is a miscarriage of clumsy lies about reality.  It's a technique for avoiding misery, but reality is the misery.  Normality is the refusal of reality.”

“Schizophrenia is a style of living with terror.  The schizophrenic is a 'realist' who has not been able to build the confident defenses that others use to deny the horror of life.  He is furthest from the animal and the cultural.”

“Creativity is an attempt to fashion an objective work that speaks on one's behalf.  It's an answer to the problem of life.  The creative person mediates natural terror and indicates a new way to triumph over it.”

“Religion expands awe and terror to the cosmos where they belong.  It takes the problem of self-justification and removes it from the objects near at hand.  It gives hope by holding open the dimension of the unknown and the unknowable.”

“Renunciation is the only way out of human conflict.  We must give our lives as a gift to the highest powers.  To surrender to the 'bigness of nature' on the highest level is the furthest reach of the self.”

“The 'god above God' is the ground of all being, the source of the 'courage to be'.  Man has to absorb into his own being the maximum amount of nonbeing.  His courage to face meaninglessness is a true cosmic heroism.”

“Taking life seriously means that whatever man does has to be done in the lived truth of the terror of creation.  Otherwise it is false.”

*My Thoughts:*  Becker's 'Denial of Death' is a profound and comprehensive analysis of the human condition.  His analysis of the 'lie' of character and the 'terror' of existence is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Becker understood that all our cultural and personal hero-systems are just ways of denying our own mortality.  He calls us to a life of renunciation and of faith, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'nightmare' of existence.  Becker is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that God is the only power that can absorb our anxiety and offer us a heroic apotheosis.

***What is Metaphysics?***

“Dread reveals no-thing.  It's a fundamental mood that discloses the slipping away of be-ing as a whole.  In dread, all things and we ourselves sink into indifference.  Dread strikes us dumb.”

“Being there means beholdenness to no-thing.  Existence is already beyond being as a whole.  We call this being above and beyond being transcendence.”

“Without the original manifestness of no-thing, no selfhood and no freedom.  Only because no-thing is manifest at the heart of existence can the full strangeness of being come over us.”

“No-thing is at first and for the most part disguised in its originality.  We get lost in being in certain ways, turning away from no-thing and into the public superficialities of existence.”

“Original dread is permanently on the verge, and yet only seldom comes into play to hold us in suspense.  We are so finite that we are not even able to bring ourselves face to face with no-thing by our own will and resolve.”

“The beholdenness of existence to no-thing on the basis of hidden dread is the surmounting of being as a whole, transcendence.”

“Pure being and pure no-thing are the same.  Being and no-thing belong together because being itself is in essence finite and revealed only in the transcendence of existence enduring no-thing.”

“Philosophy comes about only through our own life's undergoing a curious engagement with the fundamental possibilities of existence.  It's a way of letting oneself come to no-thing and becoming free of idols.”

“The basic question of metaphysics is: Why being, after all, and not rather nothing?”

“Only if the strangeness of being impresses us does it waken us and open us up to wonder.  Only on the basis of wonder, that is, the manifestness of no-thing, does the 'Why?' come up.”

*My Thoughts:*  Heidegger's 'What is Metaphysics?' is a profound and unsettling meditation on the nature of being.  His analysis of dread and no-thing is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Heidegger understood that our 'existence' is a transcendence of be-ing, and that this transcendence is only possible through an engagement with the no-thing.  He calls us to a life of philosophical inquiry and existential courage, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'Why?'.  Heidegger is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'Nothing' is the path to 'Being'.

***Kierkegaard and the Existential Philosophy***

“Human thought undergoes a complete transformation in terror, discovering new powers which lead it to the sources of truth.”

“Existential philosophy begins where rational thinking and morality have failed.  It's a rush toward the Absurd, a suspension of the ethical for the sake of an absolute relationship with God.”

“Fear of Nothingness is a condition inherent in sin and knowledge.  As long as we put our trust in reason, the rights of Nothingness and Necessity will be guaranteed by self-evidences.”

“Faith leads to the tree of life, not to knowledge.  Existential philosophy is a way of breaking through the fortress of speculative thought and reaching for the Absolute.”

“Abraham is a knight of faith because he is willing to do what is humanly impossible and morally wrong.  He trusts that for God all things are possible, and so he makes the paradoxical movement of faith.”

“Historical Christianity has forgotten God and renounced Christ.  It's satisfied with 'possibilities' and has turned the good tidings into a tolerable and advantageous moral system.”

“Madness and death are the end of everything for 'everybody'.  But the existential thinker dares to look them in the eye and find the truth in them.  'Only horror that has turned to despair can develop a man's higher powers'.”

“The 'ethical' is a servant of Necessity.  It protects our honor and pride, but conceals our powerlessness before death.  One must escape from ethics without trying to find out the end of the journey.”

“Kierkegaard's struggle with original sin and the horrors of existence is a narrative of man's desperate and convulsive search for God.  He rejected the eternal truths of reason and shook the principles of morality.”

“Faith is an 'infinite passion', a 'mania', a 'heavenly madness'.  It's the only way to find our true Self and become spirit.  Kierkegaard invoked the Absurd and craved Faith to blow up the fortress of Nothingness.”

*My Thoughts:*  Shestov's analysis of Kierkegaard is a brilliant and provocative interpretation.  His concept of the 'despair' of philosophy and the 'absurdity' of faith is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Shestov understood that all our rational and moral systems are just ways of hiding from the horror of our situation.  He calls us to a life of struggle and of passion, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'Absurd'.  Shestov is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that God is the power that can blow up the 'fortress of Nothingness' and offer us true freedom.

***Suicide Note***

“Suicide is the ultimate experiment in nihilism.  It's a way of testing the worth of life by willing its destruction.  If life is meaningless, if there is no ultimate value or purpose, then suicide is a rational and legitimate choice.”

“Honesty to the point of absurdity is my methodology.  I seek out the truths that are most deadly and destructive to me.  I want to see through all the illusions and myths that uphold human life, and confront the 'nothingness' at the heart of existence.”

“Materialism leads to rational self-destruction.  If we are nothing but emotion machines, biochemical processes, material objects, then our lives have no inherent significance.  Our emotions are illusions, our choices are determined, our identities are fictions.  To fully understand this is to lose the 'cause of life'.”

“The experiment in nihilism is to interpret all subjective experience as physical matter.  Fear, love, inspiration, dreams—all are just chemical reactions in the brain.  Once you see them this way, they lose their power to motivate or to justify your life.  You are left with a 'vacuous affair with only a chemical prestige'.”

“Nihilism is the disclosure of the 'nothingness of the world'.  It's an experience of total indifference, of absolute arbitrariness.  All actions are equal, all values are groundless, all choices are random.  From this perspective, death is equal to life.”

“The only serious question is whether there is anything to take seriously.  To test life with death is the most important question I can conceive of.  Suicide represents the pinnacle of the rational life realised.”

“Most people are not ruthless enough in their nihilism.  They cling to 'vital lies', to cultural hero-systems, to the 'religion of the common emotions'.  They place self-preservation over objectivity.  They are 'pawns of affect' who live falsely.”

“I cannot live with the implications of my own work.  I cannot reconcile my understanding of the world with my existence in it.  The separation of the interests of truth and life leads to rational self-destruction.”

“My writings are daily affirmations of death.  I am painting myself into a corner until there is only one act left.  I am killing every belief and breaking down every value until what is left is nothing.  I am destroying all values that uphold life until I am left with nowhere to stand.”

“Nihilism is where science and philosophy meet.  It's the ultimate logical conclusion of Western values.  The rational self-destruction of the West is implicit in nihilism.”

*My Thoughts:*  Heisman's work is a terrifying and tragic testament to the power of Nihilism.  His attempt to live a life of 'active unbelief' and 'rational self-destruction' is a radical and ruthless experiment.  Heisman saw through all the cultural and biological illusions that keep us alive, and found only 'nothing' at the end.  His suicide was the final act of this experiment, a literal 'willing of the progress of equality' between the biological and the physical.  Heisman is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'God' is the ultimate expression of this technological nihilism.

***The Courage to Be***

“The courage to be is the daring self-affirmation of one's being in spite of the power of nonbeing.  It's the act of taking anxiety into oneself and affirming life in the face of death and meaninglessness.”

“Anxiety is the state in which a being is aware of its possible nonbeing.  Nonbeing is present in every moment of being, and anxiety is the awareness of this presence.  There are three types of anxiety: (1) fate and death, (2) emptiness and meaninglessness, and (3) guilt and condemnation.”

“The anxiety of meaninglessness is the most radical form of anxiety.  It's the feeling that our lives have no ultimate significance, that our actions are pointless.  This form of nonbeing threatens the very meaning of existence.”

“Courage is an act of faith.  It's rooted in the 'god above God', the God who remains even when the theistic God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt and meaninglessness.  This God is the source of the 'courage to be'.”

“Doubt is a necessary element of faith.  Serious doubt is confirmation of faith, showing its unconditional character.  The act of accepting meaninglessness is a meaningful act.  It's an act of faith.”

“Mysticism is an attempt to overcome separation from the Absolute.  But mysticism neglects the human predicament and the power of nonbeing.  The experience of meaninglessness is more radical than mysticism, and therefore transcends it.”

“The courage to be requires 'participation' in the ultimate concern.  We must take into our own organization the maximum amount of the problematic of life.  Our daily life becomes a duty of cosmic proportions.”

“Faith is the state of being grasped by the divine Spirit.  It's an existential 'grasp' that resolves the contradictions of existence by accepting them.”

“True courage is to face nonbeing in all its forms.  To absorb the maximum amount of nonbeing into oneself is the highest form of courage.  This is the 'courage to be'.”

“The 'god above God' is the ground of all being, the source of the 'courage to be'.  Man can find hope even in the midst of despair by affirming his connection with this ultimate reality.”

*My Thoughts:*  Tillich's 'courage to be' is a powerful and challenging concept.  His analysis of anxiety and nonbeing is a profound expression of the human condition.  And his call for a faith that accepts doubt and meaninglessness is a direct challenge to all forms of literalism and idolatry.  Tillich's 'god above God' is a compelling and mysterious idea, a way of finding hope in the midst of despair.  Tillich is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that Nihilism is the path to God.

“Suicide is the ultimate experiment in nihilism.  It's a way of testing the worth of life by willing its destruction.  If life is meaningless, if there is no ultimate value or purpose, then suicide is a rational and legitimate choice.”

“Honesty to the point of absurdity is my methodology.  I seek out the truths that are most deadly and destructive to me.  I want to see through all the illusions and myths that uphold human life, and confront the 'nothingness' at the heart of existence.”

“Materialism leads to rational self-destruction.  If we are nothing but emotion machines, biochemical processes, material objects, then our lives have no inherent significance.  Our emotions are illusions, our choices are determined, our identities are fictions.  To fully understand this is to lose the 'cause of life'.”

“The experiment in nihilism is to interpret all subjective experience as physical matter.  Fear, love, inspiration, dreams—all are just chemical reactions in the brain.  Once you see them this way, they lose their power to motivate or to justify your life.  You are left with a 'vacuous affair with only a chemical prestige'.”

“Nihilism is the disclosure of the 'nothingness of the world'.  It's an experience of total indifference, of absolute arbitrariness.  All actions are equal, all values are groundless, all choices are random.  From this perspective, death is equal to life.”

“The only serious question is whether there is anything to take seriously.  To test life with death is the most important question I can conceive of.  Suicide represents the pinnacle of the rational life realised.”

“Most people are not ruthless enough in their nihilism.  They cling to 'vital lies', to cultural hero-systems, to the 'religion of the common emotions'.  They place self-preservation over objectivity.  They are 'pawns of affect' who live falsely.”

“I cannot live with the implications of my own work.  I cannot reconcile my understanding of the world with my existence in it.  The separation of the interests of truth and life leads to rational self-destruction.”

“My writings are daily affirmations of death.  I am painting myself into a corner until there is only one act left.  I am killing every belief and breaking down every value until what is left is nothing.  I am destroying all values that uphold life until I am left with nowhere to stand.”

“Nihilism is where science and philosophy meet.  It's the ultimate logical conclusion of Western values.  The rational self-destruction of the West is implicit in nihilism.”

*My Thoughts:*  Heisman's work is a terrifying and tragic testament to the power of Nihilism.  His attempt to live a life of 'active unbelief' and 'rational self-destruction' is a radical and ruthless experiment.  Heisman saw through all the cultural and biological illusions that keep us alive, and found only 'nothing' at the end.  His suicide was the final act of this experiment, a literal 'willing of the progress of equality' between the biological and the physical.  Heisman is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'God' is the ultimate expression of this technological nihilism.

***The Courage to Be***

“The courage to be is the daring self-affirmation of one's being in spite of the power of nonbeing.  It's the act of taking anxiety into oneself and affirming life in the face of death and meaninglessness.”

“Anxiety is the state in which a being is aware of its possible nonbeing.  Nonbeing is present in every moment of being, and anxiety is the awareness of this presence.  There are three types of anxiety: (1) fate and death, (2) emptiness and meaninglessness, and (3) guilt and condemnation.”

“The anxiety of meaninglessness is the most radical form of anxiety.  It's the feeling that our lives have no ultimate significance, that our actions are pointless.  This form of nonbeing threatens the very meaning of existence.”

“Courage is an act of faith.  It's rooted in the 'god above God', the God who remains even when the theistic God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt and meaninglessness.  This God is the source of the 'courage to be'.”

“Doubt is a necessary element of faith.  Serious doubt is confirmation of faith, showing its unconditional character.  The act of accepting meaninglessness is a meaningful act.  It's an act of faith.”

“Mysticism is an attempt to overcome separation from the Absolute.  But mysticism neglects the human predicament and the power of nonbeing.  The experience of meaninglessness is more radical than mysticism, and therefore transcends it.”

“The courage to be requires 'participation' in the ultimate concern.  We must take into our own organization the maximum amount of the problematic of life.  Our daily life becomes a duty of cosmic proportions.”

“Faith is the state of being grasped by the divine Spirit.  It's an existential 'grasp' that resolves the contradictions of existence by accepting them.”

“True courage is to face nonbeing in all its forms.  To absorb the maximum amount of nonbeing into oneself is the highest form of courage.  This is the 'courage to be'.”

“The 'god above God' is the ground of all being, the source of the 'courage to be'.  Man can find hope even in the midst of despair by affirming his connection with this ultimate reality.”

*My Thoughts:*  Tillich's 'courage to be' is a powerful and challenging concept.  His analysis of anxiety and nonbeing is a profound expression of the human condition.  And his call for a faith that accepts doubt and meaninglessness is a direct challenge to all forms of literalism and idolatry.  Tillich's 'god above God' is a compelling and mysterious idea, a way of finding hope in the midst of despair.  Tillich is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that Nihilism is the path to God.

***The Real Nature of Man***

“The spirit is the goal, and not matter.  Forms, images, bells, candles, books, churches—all are very good, very helpful to the growing plant of spirituality, but thus far and no farther.  It is very good to be born in a church, but it is very bad to die in a church.”

“Reality is the same infinite.  This is not idealism; it is not that the world does not exist.  It has a relative existence, and fulfils its requirements.  But it has no independent existence.  It exists because of the Absolute Reality beyond time, space, and causation.”

“To think that I am the spirit and not the body, and that the whole of this universe with all its relations is but a series of paintings—scenes on a canvas—of which I am the witness.  This is the secret.”

“Renunciation is the one great duty.  Live for an ideal, and leave no place in the mind for anything else.  Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and everything shall be added unto you.”

“Realisation is religion.  We hear many talking about God and the soul, but how many have realised them?  Fighting among sects shows that they do not know anything about religion.  Religion is being and becoming.”

“Thirst for God is the beginning of religion.  A man must want God like a man whose head is being held under water wants a breath of air.  He must become mad with longing, mad with 'God-intoxication'.”

“True love knows no bargaining.  We should not love God for the sake of reward or out of fear of punishment.  Love is its own reward.  The perfect man sees nothing but God.”

“Unselfish work is true renunciation.  We should work incessantly, but without looking for results.  We should join ourselves to perfectly unselfish will and work on.  In helping the world, we help ourselves.”

“Happiness belongs to him who knows this oneness, who knows he is one with this universe.  Real happiness is not in the senses, but above them.  It's found only in the Spirit.”

“The miseries of the world cannot be cured by physical help only.  The only solution is to make mankind pure.  Ignorance is the mother of all evil.  Let men have light, let them be spiritually strong and educated.”

*My Thoughts:*  Vivekananda's 'Practical Spirituality' is a powerful and inspiring vision.  His call for realisation and renunciation is a direct challenge to all forms of materialism and superficiality.  And his vision of 'unity in diversity' is a compelling and inclusive one.  Vivekananda is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that the world is Maya, an illusion, and that only the Spirit is real.  He understands that we must renounce the earthly in order to find the Divine.

***Happiness is for the Pigs***

“Most people are blissfully unaware of their 'cosmic situation'.  They are 'ontologically secure' and believe in meaning, order, and justice in life and in the universe.  They are 'psychologically healthy' and well adjusted to the norms of 'nicety and normalcy'.”

“But this 'health' is a result of repression and self-deception.  Men have a 'knack' for extracting intervals out of their total term of Being and filling them with work, chatter, and small talk.  They 'tranquilize themselves with the trivial'.”

“The existential philosopher is one who is struck by an 'acute case of uncaused depression', who suddenly sees himself as an 'upholstered pile of bones and knuckles'.  He asks the question: 'What is it all about?' and is filled with 'ontological despair' and 'existential frustration'.”

“Authentic life is lived in clear and penetrating awareness of its utter absurdity.  Fraudulent life is lived in pleasant self-deception, indistinguishable from the life of a 'giddy-witted pig'.”

“Intellectual honesty and a high spiritual demand for order and meaning drive man to the deepest antipathy for life.  We are like a man who falls out of the Empire State Building.  Any attempt to justify our fall is ludicrous.”

“Psychotherapy is a way of 'suffocating' man by offering him comfortable evasions and illusions.  It tries to 'unsick' the existential philosopher and bring him back to the 'healthy' state of self-deception.  But the patient may be 'cognitively right'.”

“Modern society is unprepared for true leisure.  The time is coming when professional sports and other distractions won't be enough to keep the labor force sedated.  Whole generations will reach the 'millionaires' level of disillusionment'.”

“Existentialists find a life lived in utter awareness of man's cosmic conditions to be a life void of human dignity.  Every human being should be forced to mature beyond what is 'biologically advantageous' and face his fate.”

“There is not a single sentence in our language that may not become an object for ridicule and painful shame.  Thrown into an eternally changing universe, human beings cannot be tied by a set of rigid rules.”

“Happiness is for the pigs.  The true human privilege is to experience 'ek-sistence', to stand in the chilly outdoors of the Nothingness.”

*My Thoughts:*  Tonnessen's 'Biosophical Pessimism' is a powerful and provocative critique of modern life.  His analysis of the 'ontological hebetants' and the 'suffocation' of psychotherapy is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Tonnessen understood that our 'health' and 'happiness' are just illusions that hide the truth of our condition.  He calls us to a life of intellectual honesty and existential courage, to a life that is truly 'worthy of man'.  Tonnessen is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'happiness' is a worldly ideal that must be renounced in order to find the True Self.

***The Denial of Death***

“Human character is a lie about the nature of reality.  It's a 'causa-sui project' intended to deny our creatureliness, our vulnerability, and our death.  We build defenses—repression, denial, social games—to hide from the terror of existence.”

“Man is a 'god who shits', a dual being who is up in the stars and yet food for worms.  This is an impossible situation to be in.  A full apprehension of man's condition would drive him insane.”

“Repression is normal and necessary for animal equanimity.  But it also dooms us to a life that is never really ours.  We are driven away from self-knowledge and self-reflection.”

“Neurosis is a miscarriage of clumsy lies about reality.  It's a technique for avoiding misery, but reality is the misery.  Normality is the refusal of reality.”

“Schizophrenia is a style of living with terror.  The schizophrenic is a 'realist' who has not been able to build the confident defenses that others use to deny the horror of life.  He is furthest from the animal and the cultural.”

“Creativity is an attempt to fashion an objective work that speaks on one's behalf.  It's an answer to the problem of life.  The creative person mediates natural terror and indicates a new way to triumph over it.”

“Religion expands awe and terror to the cosmos where they belong.  It takes the problem of self-justification and removes it from the objects near at hand.  It gives hope by holding open the dimension of the unknown and the unknowable.”

“Renunciation is the only way out of human conflict.  We must give our lives as a gift to the highest powers.  To surrender to the 'bigness of nature' on the highest level is the furthest reach of the self.”

“The 'god above God' is the ground of all being, the source of the 'courage to be'.  Man has to absorb into his own being the maximum amount of nonbeing.  His courage to face meaninglessness is a true cosmic heroism.”

“Taking life seriously means that whatever man does has to be done in the lived truth of the terror of creation.  Otherwise it is false.”

*My Thoughts:*  Becker's 'Denial of Death' is a profound and comprehensive analysis of the human condition.  His analysis of the 'lie' of character and the 'terror' of existence is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Becker understood that all our cultural and personal hero-systems are just ways of denying our own mortality.  He calls us to a life of renunciation and of faith, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'nightmare' of existence.  Becker is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that God is the only power that can absorb our anxiety and offer us a heroic apotheosis.

***What is Metaphysics?***

“Dread reveals no-thing.  It's a fundamental mood that discloses the slipping away of be-ing as a whole.  In dread, all things and we ourselves sink into indifference.  Dread strikes us dumb.”

“Being there means beholdenness to no-thing.  Existence is already beyond being as a whole.  We call this being above and beyond being transcendence.”

“Without the original manifestness of no-thing, no selfhood and no freedom.  Only because no-thing is manifest at the heart of existence can the full strangeness of being come over us.”

“No-thing is at first and for the most part disguised in its originality.  We get lost in being in certain ways, turning away from no-thing and into the public superficialities of existence.”

“Original dread is permanently on the verge, and yet only seldom comes into play to hold us in suspense.  We are so finite that we are not even able to bring ourselves face to face with no-thing by our own will and resolve.”

“The beholdenness of existence to no-thing on the basis of hidden dread is the surmounting of being as a whole, transcendence.”

“Pure being and pure no-thing are the same.  Being and no-thing belong together because being itself is in essence finite and revealed only in the transcendence of existence enduring no-thing.”

“Philosophy comes about only through our own life's undergoing a curious engagement with the fundamental possibilities of existence.  It's a way of letting oneself come to no-thing and becoming free of idols.”

“The basic question of metaphysics is: Why being, after all, and not rather nothing?”

“Only if the strangeness of being impresses us does it waken us and open us up to wonder.  Only on the basis of wonder, that is, the manifestness of no-thing, does the 'Why?' come up.”

*My Thoughts:*  Heidegger's 'What is Metaphysics?' is a profound and unsettling meditation on the nature of being.  His analysis of dread and no-thing is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Heidegger understood that our 'existence' is a transcendence of be-ing, and that this transcendence is only possible through an engagement with the no-thing.  He calls us to a life of philosophical inquiry and existential courage, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'Why?'.  Heidegger is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'Nothing' is the path to 'Being'.

***Kierkegaard and the Existential Philosophy***

“Human thought undergoes a complete transformation in terror, discovering new powers which lead it to the sources of truth.”

“Existential philosophy begins where rational thinking and morality have failed.  It's a rush toward the Absurd, a suspension of the ethical for the sake of an absolute relationship with God.”

“Fear of Nothingness is a condition inherent in sin and knowledge.  As long as we put our trust in reason, the rights of Nothingness and Necessity will be guaranteed by self-evidences.”

“Faith leads to the tree of life, not to knowledge.  Existential philosophy is a way of breaking through the fortress of speculative thought and reaching for the Absolute.”

“Abraham is a knight of faith because he is willing to do what is humanly impossible and morally wrong.  He trusts that for God all things are possible, and so he makes the paradoxical movement of faith.”

“Historical Christianity has forgotten God and renounced Christ.  It's satisfied with 'possibilities' and has turned the good tidings into a tolerable and advantageous moral system.”

“Madness and death are the end of everything for 'everybody'.  But the existential thinker dares to look them in the eye and find the truth in them.  'Only horror that has turned to despair can develop a man's higher powers'.”

“The 'ethical' is a servant of Necessity.  It protects our honor and pride, but conceals our powerlessness before death.  One must escape from ethics without trying to find out the end of the journey.”

“Kierkegaard's struggle with original sin and the horrors of existence is a narrative of man's desperate and convulsive search for God.  He rejected the eternal truths of reason and shook the principles of morality.”

“Faith is an 'infinite passion', a 'mania', a 'heavenly madness'.  It's the only way to find our true Self and become spirit.  Kierkegaard invoked the Absurd and craved Faith to blow up the fortress of Nothingness.”

*My Thoughts:*  Shestov's analysis of Kierkegaard is a brilliant and provocative interpretation.  His concept of the 'despair' of philosophy and the 'absurdity' of faith is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Shestov understood that all our rational and moral systems are just ways of hiding from the horror of our situation.  He calls us to a life of struggle and of passion, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'Absurd'.  Shestov is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that God is the power that can blow up the 'fortress of Nothingness' and offer us true freedom.

***Suicide Note***

“Suicide is the ultimate experiment in nihilism.  It's a way of testing the worth of life by willing its destruction.  If life is meaningless, if there is no ultimate value or purpose, then suicide is a rational and legitimate choice.”

“Honesty to the point of absurdity is my methodology.  I seek out the truths that are most deadly and destructive to me.  I want to see through all the illusions and myths that uphold human life, and confront the 'nothingness' at the heart of existence.”

“Materialism leads to rational self-destruction.  If we are nothing but emotion machines, biochemical processes, material objects, then our lives have no inherent significance.  Our emotions are illusions, our choices are determined, our identities are fictions.  To fully understand this is to lose the 'cause of life'.”

“The experiment in nihilism is to interpret all subjective experience as physical matter.  Fear, love, inspiration, dreams—all are just chemical reactions in the brain.  Once you see them this way, they lose their power to motivate or to justify your life.  You are left with a 'vacuous affair with only a chemical prestige'.”

“Nihilism is the disclosure of the 'nothingness of the world'.  It's an experience of total indifference, of absolute arbitrariness.  All actions are equal, all values are groundless, all choices are random.  From this perspective, death is equal to life.”

“The only serious question is whether there is anything to take seriously.  To test life with death is the most important question I can conceive of.  Suicide represents the pinnacle of the rational life realised.”

“Most people are not ruthless enough in their nihilism.  They cling to 'vital lies', to cultural hero-systems, to the 'religion of the common emotions'.  They place self-preservation over objectivity.  They are 'pawns of affect' who live falsely.”

“I cannot live with the implications of my own work.  I cannot reconcile my understanding of the world with my existence in it.  The separation of the interests of truth and life leads to rational self-destruction.”

“My writings are daily affirmations of death.  I am painting myself into a corner until there is only one act left.  I am killing every belief and breaking down every value until what is left is nothing.  I am destroying all values that uphold life until I am left with nowhere to stand.”

“Nihilism is where science and philosophy meet.  It's the ultimate logical conclusion of Western values.  The rational self-destruction of the West is implicit in nihilism.”

*My Thoughts:*  Heidegger's 'What is Metaphysics?' is a profound and unsettling meditation on the nature of being.  His analysis of dread and no-thing is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Heidegger understood that our 'existence' is a transcendence of be-ing, and that this transcendence is only possible through an engagement with the no-thing.  He calls us to a life of philosophical inquiry and existential courage, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'Why?'.  Heidegger is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'Nothing' is the path to 'Being'.

***Kierkegaard and the Existential Philosophy***

“Human thought undergoes a complete transformation in terror, discovering new powers which lead it to the sources of truth.”

“Existential philosophy begins where rational thinking and morality have failed.  It's a rush toward the Absurd, a suspension of the ethical for the sake of an absolute relationship with God.”

“Fear of Nothingness is a condition inherent in sin and knowledge.  As long as we put our trust in reason, the rights of Nothingness and Necessity will be guaranteed by self-evidences.”

“Faith leads to the tree of life, not to knowledge.  Existential philosophy is a way of breaking through the fortress of speculative thought and reaching for the Absolute.”

“Abraham is a knight of faith because he is willing to do what is humanly impossible and morally wrong.  He trusts that for God all things are possible, and so he makes the paradoxical movement of faith.”

“Historical Christianity has forgotten God and renounced Christ.  It's satisfied with 'possibilities' and has turned the good tidings into a tolerable and advantageous moral system.”

“Madness and death are the end of everything for 'everybody'.  But the existential thinker dares to look them in the eye and find the truth in them.  'Only horror that has turned to despair can develop a man's higher powers'.”

“The 'ethical' is a servant of Necessity.  It protects our honor and pride, but conceals our powerlessness before death.  One must escape from ethics without trying to find out the end of the journey.”

“Kierkegaard's struggle with original sin and the horrors of existence is a narrative of man's desperate and convulsive search for God.  He rejected the eternal truths of reason and shook the principles of morality.”

“Faith is an 'infinite passion', a 'mania', a 'heavenly madness'.  It's the only way to find our true Self and become spirit.  Kierkegaard invoked the Absurd and craved Faith to blow up the fortress of Nothingness.”

*My Thoughts:*  Shestov's analysis of Kierkegaard is a brilliant and provocative interpretation.  His concept of the 'despair' of philosophy and the 'absurdity' of faith is a direct expression of the Nihilistic experience.  Shestov understood that all our rational and moral systems are just ways of hiding from the horror of our situation.  He calls us to a life of struggle and of passion, to a life that is lived in the face of the 'Absurd'.  Shestov is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that God is the power that can blow up the 'fortress of Nothingness' and offer us true freedom.

***Suicide Note***

“Suicide is the ultimate experiment in nihilism.  It's a way of testing the worth of life by willing its destruction.  If life is meaningless, if there is no ultimate value or purpose, then suicide is a rational and legitimate choice.”

“Honesty to the point of absurdity is my methodology.  I seek out the truths that are most deadly and destructive to me.  I want to see through all the illusions and myths that uphold human life, and confront the 'nothingness' at the heart of existence.”

“Materialism leads to rational self-destruction.  If we are nothing but emotion machines, biochemical processes, material objects, then our lives have no inherent significance.  Our emotions are illusions, our choices are determined, our identities are fictions.  To fully understand this is to lose the 'cause of life'.”

“The experiment in nihilism is to interpret all subjective experience as physical matter.  Fear, love, inspiration, dreams—all are just chemical reactions in the brain.  Once you see them this way, they lose their power to motivate or to justify your life.  You are left with a 'vacuous affair with only a chemical prestige'.”

“Nihilism is the disclosure of the 'nothingness of the world'.  It's an experience of total indifference, of absolute arbitrariness.  All actions are equal, all values are groundless, all choices are random.  From this perspective, death is equal to life.”

“The only serious question is whether there is anything to take seriously.  To test life with death is the most important question I can conceive of.  Suicide represents the pinnacle of the rational life realised.”

“Most people are not ruthless enough in their nihilism.  They cling to 'vital lies', to cultural hero-systems, to the 'religion of the common emotions'.  They place self-preservation over objectivity.  They are 'pawns of affect' who live falsely.”

“I cannot live with the implications of my own work.  I cannot reconcile my understanding of the world with my existence in it.  The separation of the interests of truth and life leads to rational self-destruction.”

“My writings are daily affirmations of death.  I am painting myself into a corner until there is only one act left.  I am killing every belief and breaking down every value until what is left is nothing.  I am destroying all values that uphold life until I am left with nowhere to stand.”

“Nihilism is where science and philosophy meet.  It's the ultimate logical conclusion of Western values.  The rational self-destruction of the West is implicit in nihilism.”

*My Thoughts:*  Heisman's work is a terrifying and tragic testament to the power of Nihilism.  His attempt to live a life of 'active unbelief' and 'rational self-destruction' is a radical and ruthless experiment.  Heisman saw through all the cultural and biological illusions that keep us alive, and found only 'nothing' at the end.  His suicide was the final act of this experiment, a literal 'willing of the progress of equality' between the biological and the physical.  Heisman is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that 'God' is the ultimate expression of this technological nihilism.

***The Courage to Be***

“The courage to be is the daring self-affirmation of one's being in spite of the power of nonbeing.  It's the act of taking anxiety into oneself and affirming life in the face of death and meaninglessness.”

“Anxiety is the state in which a being is aware of its possible nonbeing.  Nonbeing is present in every moment of being, and anxiety is the awareness of this presence.  There are three types of anxiety: (1) fate and death, (2) emptiness and meaninglessness, and (3) guilt and condemnation.”

“The anxiety of meaninglessness is the most radical form of anxiety.  It's the feeling that our lives have no ultimate significance, that our actions are pointless.  This form of nonbeing threatens the very meaning of existence.”

“Courage is an act of faith.  It's rooted in the 'god above God', the God who remains even when the theistic God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt and meaninglessness.  This God is the source of the 'courage to be'.”

“Doubt is a necessary element of faith.  Serious doubt is confirmation of faith, showing its unconditional character.  The act of accepting meaninglessness is a meaningful act.  It's an act of faith.”

“Mysticism is an attempt to overcome separation from the Absolute.  But mysticism neglects the human predicament and the power of nonbeing.  The experience of meaninglessness is more radical than mysticism, and therefore transcends it.”

“The courage to be requires 'participation' in the ultimate concern.  We must take into our own organization the maximum amount of the problematic of life.  Our daily life becomes a duty of cosmic proportions.”

“Faith is the state of being grasped by the divine Spirit.  It's an existential 'grasp' that resolves the contradictions of existence by accepting them.”

“True courage is to face nonbeing in all its forms.  To absorb the maximum amount of nonbeing into oneself is the highest form of courage.  This is the 'courage to be'.”

“The 'god above God' is the ground of all being, the source of the 'courage to be'.  Man can find hope even in the midst of despair by affirming his connection with this ultimate reality.”

*My Thoughts:*  Tillich's 'courage to be' is a powerful and challenging concept.  His analysis of anxiety and nonbeing is a profound expression of the human condition.  And his call for a faith that accepts doubt and meaninglessness is a direct challenge to all forms of literalism and idolatry.  Tillich's 'god above God' is a compelling and mysterious idea, a way of finding hope in the midst of despair.  Tillich is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that Nihilism is the path to God.

***The Real Nature of Man***

“The spirit is the goal, and not matter.  Forms, images, bells, candles, books, churches—all are very good, very helpful to the growing plant of spirituality, but thus far and no farther.  It is very good to be born in a church, but it is very bad to die in a church.”

“Reality is the same infinite.  This is not idealism; it is not that the world does not exist.  It has a relative existence, and fulfils its requirements.  But it has no independent existence.  It exists because of the Absolute Reality beyond time, space, and causation.”

“To think that I am the spirit and not the body, and that the whole of this universe with all its relations is but a series of paintings—scenes on a canvas—of which I am the witness.  This is the secret.”

“Renunciation is the one great duty.  Live for an ideal, and leave no place in the mind for anything else.  Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and everything shall be added unto you.”

“Realisation is religion.  We hear many talking about God and the soul, but how many have realised them?  Fighting among sects shows that they do not know anything about religion.  Religion is being and becoming.”

“Thirst for God is the beginning of religion.  A man must want God like a man whose head is being held under water wants a breath of air.  He must become mad with longing, mad with 'God-intoxication'.”

“True love knows no bargaining.  We should not love God for the sake of reward or out of fear of punishment.  Love is its own reward.  The perfect man sees nothing but God.”

“Unselfish work is true renunciation.  We should work incessantly, but without looking for results.  We should join ourselves to perfectly unselfish will and work on.  In helping the world, we help ourselves.”

“Happiness belongs to him who knows this oneness, who knows he is one with this universe.  Real happiness is not in the senses, but above them.  It's found only in the Spirit.”

“The miseries of the world cannot be cured by physical help only.  The only solution is to make mankind pure.  Ignorance is the mother of all evil.  Let men have light, let them be spiritually strong and educated.”

*My Thoughts:*  Vivekananda's 'Practical Spirituality' is a powerful and inspiring vision.  His call for realisation and renunciation is a direct challenge to all forms of materialism and superficiality.  And his vision of 'unity in diversity' is a compelling and inclusive one.  Vivekananda is a 'Nihiltheist' because he understands that the world is Maya, an illusion, and that only the Spirit is real.  He understands that we must renounce the earthly in order to find the
