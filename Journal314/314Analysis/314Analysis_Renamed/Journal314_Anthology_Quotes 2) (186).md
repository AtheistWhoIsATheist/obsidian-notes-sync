# The Distinction Between Summary and Definition

* * *

# 1\. Summary =

a longer, paragraph form writing, covering more relevant ground and leverages more in-depth techniques such as more detailed descriptions, asking questions, suggesting next steps, etc.

# 2\. Definition = 

a briefer version (usually bullet points) of concise definitions and descriptions involving Nihiltheism.  Less intensive than a "summary".

# 3\. Outline =

almost a combo of summary and definition with an added _emphasis_ on a **framework** for further exploration and analysis.
