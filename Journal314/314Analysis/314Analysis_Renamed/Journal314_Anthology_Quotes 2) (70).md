<br>

1\. First, you will be provided with the text to analyze:

<br>

<text>

{{TEXT}}

</text>

<br>

2\. Next, you will be given a guiding question to focus your analysis:

<br>

<question>

{{QUESTION}}

</question>

<br>

3\. **Begin your analysis by creating an overview and identifying themes**:

   - Create an <overview> section that summarizes 3-5 main ideas or philosophical insights from the text.

   - Identify underlying theoretical frameworks and establish contextual relevance.

   - Map interconnections between major themes and highlight unique perspectives.

<br>

4\. **Develop a multi-layered analysis**:

   - Create separate <analysis> sections for each crucial insight.

   - Include conceptual explanations, historical context, and contemporary relevance.

   - Provide textual evidence using <quote> tags for direct quotations.

   - Explore complexities, including paradoxes, nuances, and multiple interpretations.

   - Discuss practical implications and philosophical connections.
