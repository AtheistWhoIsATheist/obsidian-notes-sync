# Asceticism, Quietism, Suffering, and solitude

### Intellectual Meditation (IM):

In the contemplative examination of Asceticism, Solitude, Quietism, and Suffering, we find a confluence of themes that invite a deep, almost monastic introspection into the human spirit's capacity for endurance, silence, and transformation. These concepts, while distinct, interlace to form a rich tapestry of spiritual and philosophical inquiry. The study of these ideas provides not only a historical or theological perspective but also a profoundly personal exploration of the limits and expanses of the self. By dissecting these concepts, we delve into the essence of human existence and its relentless quest for meaning, often emerging in the quietude of profound self-denial or the depths of solitary reflection.

<br>

\*\*Nihiltheism & Asceticism\*\*:

Nihiltheism is a philosophy that embraces a traditional view of nihilism, along with the claim that the essential Nothingness of existence is seen as a construct, and possibly the embodiment of the Transcendent/Divine. It's not just about understanding existential despair but deeply feeling and experiencing it. Nihiltheism encourages an active engagement with the Nothingness in our physical world, ascetic in nature, as a "reminder” of the Transcendent, and the process of renunciation of the world.

 This philosophy connects with a wide range of philosophical and religious traditions, including existentialists like Soren Kierkegaard and Martin Heidegger, Christian mystics like Meister Eckhart and Miguel de Molinos, and Eastern philosophies like Buddhism, Vedanta, and Taoism, which all, in some way, accept or embrace a “Nothingness” to human existence.  Even figures like Emil Cioran and Paul Tillich, who may initially seem at odds with each other, share common ground under the lens of Nihiltheism.

 Unlike philosophies offering ways to avoid existential despair, Nihiltheism suggests immersing oneself within it, while also acknowledging the impossibility of participating in this state of being for any extended period of time.  This is the same insight that is found throughout many thinkers in the history of philosophy and religion.  For example, William James’ “divided-self”,  Soren Kierkegaard’s “double-mindedness”, Martin Heidegger’s “always falling” into the they, Plato’s distain for the human body as it drags one, always, back down into the world and away from The Forms, Vivekananda’s fight of relinquishing of the ego, and even the “original sin” of Christianity.  Nihiltheism views the Nothingness of the physical world as an undeniable reality.

 This worldview questions if our experience of Nihilism can be fully explained by science, and wonders if it could signify something Divine.  This is where psychedelics are noteworthy within Nihiltheism. Particular psychedelic medicines can trigger Transcendent experiences that align with its key tenets, such as an out of body release into an unimaginable, other-worldly, timeless realm, the death of the ego, a full renunciation of the human and any conception of the worldly, a oneness with everything, along with what can only be described as both an encounter and a union with an "Infinite Presence".  

 When these psychedelic medicines are pursued properly, which include much philosophical contemplation, correct set and setting, along with an intent to peak beyond the veil and possibly encountering the Infinite, can affirm a nihilistic worldview.  The consequences that are produced, with an unimaginable force, reveal an incorporeal realm of Nothingness that can be described in a similar manner as many of those within the mystical traditions, as a a “Full” or "Plentiful" Nothingness, Emptiness, or Void.  The experience is one that is terrifyingly-beautiful, completely other-worldly, yet leaves one perceiving this “space” as if one has been here before, a sense of familiarity, as if one has finally “come home”.

 While one may experience a fleeting connection to the Transcendent, an eventual retreat, from the recollective perception similar to Plato’s Forms, to return to mundane reality and the Nothingness of the world, renewing  our existential fears and doubts, consequently leaving one in the irresolvable state of purgatory, unable to make a leap of affirming any objectivity to the experience.

 Living as a Nihiltheist involves a constant reminder of life's fleeting nature and the physical world's insignificance. Morality is perceived uniquely in Nihiltheism, adopting a stance of "non-movement". In practice, this perspective may resemble mere pacifism or the Taoist philosophy of non-engagement with the world, often described as "doing nothing." 

 However, in the extreme interpretation of moral values being considered nonexistent, Nihiltheism takes this moral inaction to its utmost extent.  The Nihiltheist does no harm, not in order to “do good” or “avoid evil”, but as a step in the renunciation of the physical world.

 Nihiltheism views any attempt to "move past" Nihilism as a desperate evasion of the harsh truth of existence, instead of a pursuit, participation of the Nothingness and a renunciation of the world. There are warnings that trying to find meaning in the meaningless, by elevating the finite up to the equivalent of the Infinite, only deepens our illusions, leading to an inauthentic life by not renouncing the finite while also not using philosophy, as Plato proclaimed, as a preparation for one’s inevitable death.

# Mission Guide 

1. **Conceptual Foundations** : Based on the rich summaries provided, Nihiltheism is a framework that intertwines existential despair with a higher, transcendent reality. It is both a lived experience and an intellectual pursuit, drawing on a diverse range of philosophical and religious traditions.
2. **Focus Areas** : To build on this, we can explore ideas like ascetic practices, the nature of suffering, the quest for enlightenment, and the moral implications of existential despair. These areas offer rich ground for synthesis.
3. **Philosophical Traditions** : Existentialism offers a deep dive into the human condition, while religious traditions like Buddhism, Vedanta, and Christian Mysticism provide insights into the nature of suffering and the quest for enlightenment or union with the divine.
4. **Interdisciplinary Synthesis** : The challenge here is to find a balance that honors the unique contributions of each tradition while forging new connections. How do existential despair and the search for higher meaning interact in a Nihiltheistic framework? 
5. **Conceptual Development** : What novel ideas can emerge from these connections? How do they contribute to the existing body of thought within Nihiltheism?

# Practical Inquiries

To contribute to Nihiltheism, let's consider the following conceptual bridges:

1. **Ascetic Aesthetics** : Drawing from the Stoic idea of 'Apatheia' and Buddhist 'Detachment', Nihiltheism could explore an "Ascetic Aesthetics" that values the beauty in renouncing worldly attachments as a route to understanding the Transcendent. 
2. **Suffering as a Portal** : Christian Mysticism often regards suffering as a way to come closer to God. Existentialism, on the other hand, sees suffering as an inherent part of human existence. Nihiltheism could posit "Sufferential Transcendence," where existential suffering is not just an end but a transformative pathway to higher realities.
3. **Moral Ambiguity and Ethical Stasis** : Drawing from Nietzsche's 'Beyond Good and Evil' and the Taoist concept of 'Wu Wei' (non-action), Nihiltheism can delve into "Ambiguous Ethics," a state where moral absolutes are suspended in favor of a dynamic, situational ethics that aligns with its principles of 'non-movement'.
4. **Enlightened Despair** : Merging the Buddhist concept of 'Enlightenment' with the existential notion of 'Despair,' Nihiltheism could explore the paradox of "Enlightened Despair," a state where profound understanding of existential void leads to a form of enlightenment that is deeply rooted in the human condition.
5. **Transcendent Materialism** : Drawing from Vedanta's 'Maya' and Marx's 'Historical Materialism,' Nihiltheism could explore the notion that our material world, while illusory in a spiritual sense, serves as an essential platform for any quest for the Transcendent, thus giving it a form of 'transcendent validity.'

## Outline for Research on Asceticism

To embark on our exploration of asceticism and its potential correlations to Nihiltheism, we will follow a structured approach that encompasses contextual mapping, phenomenological synthesis, meta-analysis, conceptual development, interdisciplinary validation, dialectical scrutiny, and implications modeling. This rigorous methodology will ensure a comprehensive and robust examination of the topic. Let us proceed with each step:

## 1\. Contextual Landscape Mapping:

To begin, we will survey the broader academic and intellectual landscape surrounding asceticism. This includes understanding the historical context, key thinkers, and seminal texts related to ascetic practices across different religious and philosophical traditions. By situating asceticism within its wider context, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of its significance and potential relevance to Nihiltheism.

## 2\. Phenomenological Synthesis of Literary Works:

Next, we will engage in a phenomenological synthesis of literary works that delve into ascetic practices. This involves interpreting and analyzing texts that explore the lived experiences of ascetics, their motivations, and the transformative effects of asceticism. By synthesizing these literary works, we can gain insights into the subjective aspects of asceticism and its implications for understanding the human condition.

## 3\. Meta-Analysis and Interpretation:

Building upon the phenomenological synthesis, we will conduct a meta-analysis of various perspectives on asceticism. This entails examining different philosophical, religious, and cultural viewpoints on ascetic practices. By identifying overarching patterns and emerging paradigms, we can develop a more comprehensive framework for understanding asceticism and its potential connections to Nihiltheism.

## 4\. Conceptual Development:

Using the insights gained from the meta-analysis, we will develop conceptual frameworks that bridge asceticism and Nihiltheism. This involves formulating hypotheses, exploring potential correlations, and crafting theoretical models that highlight the intersections between ascetic practices and Nihiltheistic principles. Through this conceptual development, we aim to uncover new insights and expand our understanding of Nihiltheism in relation to asceticism.

## 5\. Interdisciplinary Validation:

To further enrich our exploration, we will incorporate findings from interdisciplinary fields such as psychology, neuroscience, anthropology, and sociology. By examining research and theories from these disciplines, we can validate and enhance our conceptual frameworks. This interdisciplinary validation will help ground our exploration in empirical reality and provide a broader perspective on the connections between asceticism and Nihiltheism.

## 6\. Dialectical Scrutiny:

In this step, we will critically analyze arguments both for and against the correlations between asceticism and Nihiltheism. By engaging in dialectical scrutiny, we can identify potential strengths and weaknesses in our conceptual frameworks. This process will involve addressing counterarguments, exploring alternative perspectives, and refining our understanding through rigorous intellectual discourse.

## 7\. Implications & Worldview Modeling:

Finally, we will explore the implications of the correlations between asceticism and Nihiltheism for various worldviews. By extrapolating the potential consequences of these correlations, we can gain insights into how asceticism may shape and inform different philosophical, religious, and existential perspectives. This step will involve logical reasoning, worldview modeling, and the exploration of existential implications.
