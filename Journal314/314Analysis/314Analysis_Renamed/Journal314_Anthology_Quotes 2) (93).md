# The Use of Quotes in my Writing

[[2024-2-8]]

* * *

## Use of Quotations in Sources on Nihiltheism

The sources often use quotations to **support the author's perspective on Nihiltheism**, which is often presented as a personal and subjective experience rather than a purely theoretical concept.

- **Convergence of Perspectives**: The author often uses quotations from diverse thinkers, including philosophers and theologians, to illustrate that the experience of nihilism transcends cultural, religious, and philosophical boundaries. \[1-4\] The author argues that, despite their differing backgrounds, these thinkers have arrived at similar conclusions regarding the experience of nihilism. \[3, 4\]
- **Beyond Intellectualism**: The author's use of quotations underscores their critique of traditional academia and the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. They argue that true philosophy is an ongoing exploration rather than a finished product. \[1, 4\] These quotations suggest that the pursuit of abstract knowledge is inadequate to grasp the full depth of the nihilistic experience. \[1, 4\]
- **Shared Insights**: The author also uses quotations to highlight the commonalities found in the writings of diverse philosophers, pointing towards an underlying unity in their understanding of the human condition. \[5, 6\]
- **Experience Over Theory**: The author emphasizes the importance of direct experience in understanding nihilism. \[7-9\] By incorporating quotes that capture the emotional and existential impact of nihilism, the author emphasizes that this is not a mere philosophical abstraction but a lived experience. \[7-9\]
- **Transcending the Author's Voice**: The author sometimes aims to diminish their own voice, letting the quotes speak for themselves. \[10-13\] This emphasizes the universality and shared nature of the nihilistic experience. \[10-13\]

**In summary**, the author uses quotations extensively in these sources to:

- Demonstrate the breadth and depth of the nihilistic experience.
- Support the idea that nihilism is a universal human experience.
- Critique traditional philosophical and academic approaches to the subject.
- Emphasize the importance of lived experience in understanding nihilism.
- Underscore the shared insights of diverse thinkers grappling with the human condition.

## Question: 

- Common Criticism about my writing is the extensive use of quotes. "Why do you use so many quotes?"

## Answer : 

- I explicitly state it's not about my voice and that all the quotes should sound as if they are from one unified "voice", in the attempt to show a universality to the experience of what I refer to as nihilksm
- Furthermore:
    -  \*\*The author quotes extensively from a variety of thinkers and philosophers to underscore the complexity and **_universality_** (my emphasis) of the human experience of nihilism.\*\*
    - \*\*Specific thinkers and philosophers quoted extensively include:\*\*
        - \* Martin Heidegger
        - \* Søren Kierkegaard
        - \* William James
        - \* Martin Luther
        - \* Friedrich Nietzsche
        - \* Aldous Huxley
        - \* Swami Vivekananda
        - \* St. Augustine

- \*\*The extensive use of quotes from these thinkers contributes to the author's argumentation and the overall structure of the work in the following ways:\*\*
- \*\*It demonstrates the **_shared insights_** (my emphasis) of various philosophers\*\*, suggesting an underlying unity in their descriptions of existential experiences, which reinforces the idea that the experience of nihilism is universal and transcends individual perspectives and backgrounds.
- \*\*It highlights the complexity and depth of the nihilistic experience\*\*, as it draws on the _**diverse perspectives of thinkers from different philosophical and religious traditions**_, (my emphasis) each offering unique insights into the nature of existence and meaning.
- \*\*It creates a sense of intellectual authority and credibility\*\*, as the author draws on the wisdom and insights of established thinkers to support their own arguments and observations about nihilism, lending weight to their analysis.
- \*\*It allows the author to engage in a dialogue with these thinkers\*\*, exploring different viewpoints and perspectives on nihilism, which enriches the overall discussion and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.
- \*\*It serves as a springboard for the author's own reflections and insights\*\*, as they draw inspiration and build upon the ideas of the quoted thinkers to develop their own unique perspective on nihilism.
