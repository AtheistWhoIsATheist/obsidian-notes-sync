### \*Note: Always put this for Sam concerning the creation of placeholders:

    - “Yes, I would love that, it would be extremely helpful for me to have placeholders. However, since you've noted that your generation of placeholders usually come out as 'medium quality,' let's take a step back for a second and address this issue before immediately crafting our placeholders. To generate elite level placeholders use a Scratchpad and think step-by-step regarding each placeholder. By carefully reviewing each placeholder through a meticulous step-by-step reasoning process you will guarantee each one is crystal clear, rigorously detailed, and directly relevant to the prompt. This rigorous step-by-step process will elevate the placeholders up to a 'God-Level Tier of Unsurpassed Excellence.' and optimize the placeholders for the best possible outputs.”
