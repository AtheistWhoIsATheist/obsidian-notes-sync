## _**On the Heights of Despair**_

**\- “****why can't we stay closed up inside ourselves? why do we chase after expression and form, trying to deliver ourselves of our precious contents or"meanings," desperately attempting to organize what is after all a rebellious and chaotic process? wouldn't it be more creative simply to** **surrender to our inner fluidity without any intention of objectifying it, intimately and voluptuously soaking in our own inner turmoil and struggle? then we would feel with much richer intensity the whole inner growth of spiritual experience all kinds of insights would blend** **and flourish in a fertile effervescence. a sensation of actuality and spiritual content would** **be born, like the rise of a wave or a musical phrase. to be full of one's self, not in the sense of pride, but of enrichment, to be tormented by a sense of** _**inner infinity**_**...”** (me- Molinos says this almost exactly)

**\- “only a few can endure such experiences to the end. there is always a serious danger in repressing something which requires objectification, in locking up explosive energy, because there comes a moment when one can not restrain such overwhelming power. and then the fall is from too much plenitude. there are experiences and obsessions one cannot live with. salvation lies in confessing them. the terrifying experience of death, when preserved in consciousness, becomes** **ruinous. if you talk about death, you save part of yourself. but at the same time, something of your real self dies, because objectified meanings lose the actuality they have in consciousness.”**

**\- “the deepest subjective experiences are also the most universal, because through them one** **reaches the original source of life.** _**true interiorization leads to a universality inaccessible to those who remain on the periphery.**_**”**

**\- “the vulgar interpretation of universality calls it a phenomenon of quantitative expansion** **rather than a qualitatively rich containment. such an interpretation sees lyricism as a peripheral** **and inferior phenomenon, the product of spiritual inconsistency, failing to notice that the lyrical resources of subjectivity show remark able freshness and depth. there are people who become lyrical only at crucial moments in their life; some only in the throes of death, when their** **entire past suddenly appears before them and hits them with the force of a waterfall. many become lyrical after some decisively critical experience, when the turmoil of their** **inner being reaches paroxysm. thus people who are normally inclined toward objectivity and impersonality, strangers both to themselves and to reality, once they become prisoners of love, experience feelings which actualize all their personal resources. the fact that almost everybody writes poetry when in love proves that the resources of conceptual thinking are too poor to** **express their inner infinity; inner lyricism finds adequate objectification only through fluid, irrational material.”** (a great description of Tillich's ideas of Religious Symbolism)

**\- “the experience of suffering is a similar case. you never suspected what lay hidden in yourself and in the world, you were living contentedly at the periphery of things, when suddenly those feelings of suffering which are second only to death itself take hold of you and transport you** **into a region of infinite complexity, where your subjectivity tosses about in a maelstrom. to be lyrical from suffering means to achieve that inner purification in which wounds cease to be mere** **outer manifestations without deep complications and begin to participate in the essence of your being.”**

**\- “there is no authentic lyricism without a grain of interior madness. it is significant that the beginnings of all mental psychoses are marked by a lyrical phase during which all the usual barriers and limits disappear, giving way to an inner drunkenness of the most fertile, creative kind.”**

**\- “the lyrical state is a state beyond forms and systems.”**

**\- “how distant everything is! i don't understand why we must do things in this world, why we**

**must have friends and aspirations, hopes and dreams. wouldn't it be better to retreat to a faraway corner of the world, where all its noise and complications would be heard no**

**more? Then we could renounce culture and ambitions; we would lose everything and gain nothing; for what is there to be gained from this world? there are people to whom gain is unimportant, who are hopelessly unhappy and lonely. we are so closed to one another! and yet, were we to be totally open to each other, reading into the depths of our souls, how much of our**

**destiny would we see? We are so lonely in life that we must ask ourselves if the loneliness of dying is not a symbol of our human existence. can there be any consolation at the last moment? this willingness to live and die in society is a mark of great deficiency. it is a thousand times preferable to die somewhere alone and abandoned so that you can die without melodramatic**

**posturing, unseen by anyone. i despise people who on their death bed master themselves and**

**adopt a pose in order to impress. tears do not burn except in solitude. those who ask to be surrounded by friends when they die do so out of fear and inability to live their final moments**

**alone. they want to for get death at the moment of death. they lack infinite heroism. why don't they lock their door and suffer those maddening sensations with a lucidity and a fear beyond all limits? we are so isolated from everything! but isn't everything equally inaccessible to us? the deepest and most organic death is death in solitude, when even light becomes a principle of death.** _**in such moments you will be severed from life, from love, smiles, friends and even from death. and you will ask yourself if there is anything besides the nothingness of the world and your own nothingness**_**.”** (Would Tillich agree with this?)

**\- “on not wanting to live. there are experiences which one cannot survive, after which one feels that there is no meaning left in anything. once you have reached the limits of life, having**

**lived to extremity all that is offered at those dangerous borders, the everyday gesture and the usual aspiration lose their seductive charm.”**  (Bach is needed, right Heisman?)

**\- “the most terrifying intensification bursts into nothingness. you grow inside, you dilate madly until there are no boundaries left, you reach the edge of light, where light is stolen by night, and**

**from that plenitude as in a savage whirlwind you are thrown straight into nothingness.”**

**\- “at the edge of life everything is an occasion for death...every experience is in this case a leap into nothingness.”**

**\- “did not all the mystics feel that they could not live after their great ecstasies? what could they expect from this world, those who sense, beyond the normal limits, life, loneliness, despair, death?”**

**\- “the passion for the absurd. there are no arguments. Can anyone who has reached the limit bother with arguments, causes, effects, moral considerations, and so forth? of course not. for**

**such a person there are only unmotivated motives for living.**  _**on the heights of despair, the passion for the absurd is the only thing that can still throw a demonic light on chaos. When all the current reasons- moral, esthetic, religious, social, and so on - no longer guide one's life, how can one sustain life without succumbing to nothingness? Only by a connection with the absurd**_**, by love of absolute uselessness, loving something which does not have substance but which simulates an illusion of life.”** (sounds like Tillich's concrete religious symbols)

**\- “i feel i must burst because of all that life offers me and because of the prospect of death.**

**i feel that i am dying of solitude, of love, of despair, of hatred, of all that this world offers me.** 

**with every experience i expand like a balloon blown up beyond its capacity. the most terrifying intensification bursts into nothingness.”**

**\- “i live because the mountains do not laugh and the worms do not sing. the passion for the absurd can grow only in a man who has exhausted everything, yet is still capable of undergoing awesome transfigurations.**  _**for one who has lost everything there is nothing left in life except the passion of the absurd.”**_

**\-** **“what else in life could still move such a person? what seductions? some say: self-sacrifice for humanity, the public good, the cult of the beautiful, and so forth. i like only those people who have done away with all that - even for a short time. only they have lived in an absolute**

**manner. only they have the right to speak about life.”**

**\-** _**“only the sick man is delighted by life and praises it so that he won't collapse.”**_

**\- “true solitude is the feeling of being absolutely isolated between the earth and the sky. nothing should detract attention from these phenomena of absolute isolation: a fearfully lucid intuition**

**will reveal the entire drama of man's finite nature facing the infinite nothingness of the world. solitary walks - extremely fertile and dangerous at the same time, for the inner life - must take place in such a way that nothing will obscure the solitary's meditation on man's isolation** **in the world. Solitary walks are propitious to an intense process of interiorization especially in the evening, when none of the usual seductions can steal one's interest. then revelations about the** **world spring from the deepest corner of the spirit, from the place where it has detached itself from life, from the wound of life. to achieve spirituality, one must be very lonely. so much death-****in-life and so many inner conflagrations.”**

**\- “I am: therefore the world is meaningless.”** (Ha! how many times has this been said out loud?)

**\- “life is the privilege of mediocre people. only mediocrities live at life's normal temperature; the** 

**others are consumed at temperatures at which life can not endure, at which they can barely breathe,** _**already one foot beyond life.**_**”**

**\-** _**“i propose the agony method to rid you of all these imperfections. apply it to every generation and its effects will soon be evident. maybe in this way i too could become useful to mankind!**_

_**bring every man to the agony of life's last moments by whip, fire, or injections, and through terrible torture he will undergo the great purification afforded by a vision of death. then free him and**_

_**let him run in a fright until he falls exhausted. i warrant you that the effect is incomparably greater than any obtained through normal means. if i could, i would drive the entire world to agony to achieve a radical purification of life; i would set a fire burning insidiously at the roots of life, not to**_

_**destroy them but to give them a new and different sap, a new heat. the fire i would set to the world would not bring ruin but cosmic transfiguration. in this way life would adjust to higher temperatures and would cease to be an environment propitious to mediocrity. and maybe in this dream, death**_

_**too would cease to be immanent in life.”**_ (take psychedelics correctly, Mckenna)

_**\- “**_**i'm speaking of a precise painful sensation, not a vague and undetermined one. as in a hallucinatory dream, you feel that only your head is left, without foundation and support, without a body.”**

_**\- “**_**it is a weariness which consumes and destroys. no effort, no hope, no illusion can satisfy you any longer. shocked witless by your own catastrophe, unable to think or to act, caught in cold and**

**heavy darkness, solitary as in moments of profound regret, you have reached the negative limit of life, its absolute temperature, where the last illusions about life freeze.”**

_**\- “**_**i call agonic only those dramatic moments in the battle between life and death when the presence of death is experienced consciously and painfully. true agony occurs when you pass into nothingness through death, when a feeling of weariness consumes you irrevocably and death**

**wins. in every true agony there is a triumph of death, even though you may continue to live after those moments of weariness. there is nothing imaginary in this turmoil. every agony bears a conclusive stamp.** _**isn't agony similar to an incurable sickness which torments us intermittently (me- Sickness Unto Death)?**_  **agonic moments chart the progress of death in life, revealing a drama in our consciousness caused by the disruption of the balance between life and death. such moments**

**are not possible except in** _**that sensation of weariness which brings life down to its absolute negative value.”**_

**\- “i want to die but I am sorry that I want to die. this is the feeling experienced by those who abandon themselves to nothingness.”** (Kierkegaard, Tillich _courage to be pg 11_)

**\- “how good it would be if one could die by throwing oneself into an infinite void!”**

**\- “the complexity of the grotesque born out of despair resides in its capacity to indicate an inner infinity and to produce a paroxysm of the highest tension.”**

**\- “it is evident to** _**anyone who understands the multiple forms of inner drama that the grotesque hides secret tragedies, indirectly expressed.**_ **whoever has seen his face grotesquely disfigured can never forget it, because he will always be afraid of himself.”**

**\- “one loses one's sense of security and the normal sensation of the immediate and the concrete.”**

**\- “the truly awful thing in madness is that we sense a total and irrevocable loss of life while we are still living.”**

**\- “in death one loses everything, by a fall into nothingness. that is why the fear of death is persistent and essential, but actually less strange than the fear of madness, in which our semi-presence creates an anxiety more complex than the organic fear of the total nothingness of death. but wouldn't madness be an escape from the misery of life?”**

**\- “i would like instead a shower of warm light to fall from me, transfiguring the entire world, an**

**unecstatic burst of light preserving the calm of luminous eternity. far from the concentrations of ecstasy, it would be all graceful lightness and smiling warmth. The entire world should float in this dream of light, in this transparent and unreal state of delight.**  _**obstacles and matter, form and limits would cease to exist.**_ **then let me die of light in such a landscape.”**

**\- “there are questions which, once approached, either isolate you or kill you outright. afterward you have nothing more to lose. from then on, your erstwhile "serious" pursuits- your spiritual**

**quest for more varied forms of life, your limitless longing for inaccessible things, your elevated**

**frustration with the limits of empiricism- all become simple manifestations of an excessively exuberant sensibility, lacking the profound seriousness which characterizes the man who has penetrated the realm of dangerous mysteries****.”**

_**\- “**_**only the organic and existential thinker is capable of this kind of seriousness, because truth for him is alive,** _**born from inner agony and organic disorder rather than useless speculation.**_ **out**

**of the shadow of the abstract man, who thinks for the pleasure of thinking, emerges the organic man, who thinks because of a vital imbalance, and who is beyond science and art.”** (Huxley said this about art, I find philosophy to be 'useless speculation, rather than a concern about the Truth of existence)

**\- “to step into death does not mean, as commonly believed, especially by christians, to draw one's**

**last breath and to pass into a region qualitatively different from life.** _**it means, rather, to discover in the course of life the way toward death and to find in life's vital signs the immanent abyss of death.”**_

_**\- “but why is the experience of agony so rare? Can it be that our hypothesis is entirely false and**_ _**that sketching a metaphysics of death is possible only by accepting death's transcendental nature?”**_

**\- “from a grave perspective, every step in life is a step into death and memory is only the sign**

**of nothingness.** _**the average man, deprived of metaphysical understanding**_**, does not have this consciousness of progressive advance into death, though neither he nor anyone else can escape its inexorable destiny. but when consciousness becomes independent of life, the revelation of death**

**becomes so strong that its presence destroys all naiveté, all joyful enthusiasm, and all natural voluptuousness. to have the consciousness of death is something perverse and extremely corrupt. the naive poetry of life, its seductions and charms, appear empty of content.** _**equally empty are man's finalizing projects and his theological illusions.”**_

**\-** _**“whoever has not experienced the awful agony of death, rising and spreading like a surge of blood, like the choking grasp of a snake which provokes terrifying hallucinations, does not know the demonic character of life and the state of inner effervescence from which great transfigurations arise. such a state of black drunkenness is a necessary prerequisite to understanding why one wishes the immediate end of this world.”**_

**\- “happy the man who could abandon himself to this becoming and could absorb all the possibilities offered each moment, ignoring the agonizingly problematic evaluation**

**which discovers in every moment an insurmountable relativity.”**

**\-** _**“the revelation of death's immanence in life occurs during illnesses and long depressive states.**_ 

_**there are, of course, other ways, but they are accidental and individual, and do not have the same potential for revelation as illness or depression.”**_

**\- “only those who truly suffer are capable of of genuine content and infinite seriousness...there are many who would gladly give up metaphysical revelations, obtained through despair, agony, and death, in exchange for a naive love or the voluptuous unconsciousness of dance.”**

**\-** _**“these states, in which separation from the world steadily and painfully increases, bring man closer to his inner reality and cause him to discover death in his own subjectivity. a growing interiority progresses toward the essential center of subjectivity, overcoming all the social forms which usually mask it. once beyond this center, progressive interiority discovers the region**_

_**where life mingles with death, where man has not yet detached himself from the primary sources of existence, where the demonic rhythm of life works with complete irrationality. in cases of depression, the awareness of death's immanence in life creates an atmosphere of constant dissatisfaction and restlessness that can never be appeased.”**_

**\-** _**“the fear of death, which is nothing but the fear of the nothingness into which death throws us, proves that death presupposes nothingness.”**_

**\-** _**“even though belief in eternity is necessary as historical man's unique consolation, the catastrophic ending of this tragedy of life and of man in particular will demonstrate the illusion of such naive faith.”**_

**\- “those who try to eliminate the fear of death through artificial reasoning are totally**

**mistaken, because it is impossible to cancel an organic fear by way of abstract constructs. whoever seriously considers the question of death must be afraid. Even those who believe in eternity do so because they are afraid of death. there is in their faith a painful effort to save - even without an absolute certitude-** _**the world of values in which they live and to which they contribute, an effort to defeat the nothingness inherent in the temporal and attain the universal in eternity. Death met without religious faith leaves nothing standing.”**_

_**\- “yet other philosophies and doctrines say almost nothing about death. the only valid attitude is absolute silence or a cry of despair. some people maintain that the fear of death does not have a deeper justification, because as long as there is an i there is no death, and once dead there**_

_**is no i any longer. these people have forgotten about the very strange phenomenon of gradual agony. what comfort does this artificial distinction between the i and death offer a man who has a strong premonition of death? what meaning can logical argument or subtle thought have for someone deeply imbued with a feeling of the irrevocable? all attempts to bring existential questions onto a logical plane are null and void. philosophers are too proud to confess their fear of death and too**_

_**supercilious to acknowledge the spiritual fecundity of illness. their reflections on death exhibit**_

_**a hypocritical serenity; in fact, they tremble with fear more than anyone else. one should not forget that philosophy is the art of masking inner torments.”**_

_**\- “**_**the art of dying cannot be learned, because there is no technique, there are no rules. the irrevocability of agony is experienced by each individual alone, through infinite and intense suffering. most people are unaware of the slow agony within themselves.**  _**for them there is only**_

_**one kind of agony, the one immediately preceding the fall into absolute nothingness. only such moments of agony bring about important existential revelations in consciousness.**_ **that is why they expect everything from the end instead of trying to grasp the meaning of a slow revelatory agony. the end will reveal too little, and they will die as ignorant as they have lived.”**

**\- “**_**isn't nothingness, then, salvation?**_ **but how can there be salvation in nothingness? if salvation**

**is nearly impossible through existence, how can it be possible through the complete absence of existence? since there is no salvation either in existence or in nothingness, let this world with its eternal laws be smashed to pieces.”**

**\- “the sensation of expansion toward nothingness present in melancholy has its roots in a weariness characteristic of all negative states. this weariness separates man from the world. life's intense rhythm, its organic inner pulse, weakens. weariness is the first organic determinant of knowledge. because it creates the necessary conditions for man's differentiation from the world, weariness leads one to the perspective which places the world in front of man.”**

**\- “man grows wings in melancholy not in order to enjoy the world but in order to be alone. what** **is the meaning of loneliness in melancholy? isn't it related to the feeling of interior and exterior infinity?”**

**\- “melancholy detachment removes man from his natural surroundings. his outlook on infinity** **shows him to be lonely and forsaken. the sharper our consciousness of the world's infinity, the more acute our awareness of our own finitude. in some states this awareness is painfully depressing, but in melancholy it is less tormenting and sometimes even rather voluptuous.**

**the disparity between the world's infinity and man's finitude is a serious cause for despair; but** **when one looks at this disparity in states of melancholy, it ceases to be painful and the world appears endowed with a strange, sickly beauty.”**

**\- “nothing is important.**  _**how important can it be that i suffer and think?**_ **My presence in this world will disturb a few tranquil lives and will unsettle the unconscious and pleasant naiveté** 

**of others.**  _**although i feel that my tragedy is the greatest in history- greater than the fall of empires - i am nevertheless aware of my total insignificance. i am absolutely persuaded that i am nothing in this universe; yet i feel that mine is the only real existence.**_ **if i had to choose between the world and me, i would reject the world, its lights and laws, unafraid to glide alone in absolute nothingness.**  _**although life for me is torture, i cannot renounce it, because i do not believe in the absolute values in whose name i would sacrifice myself.**_**”**

**\- “i wonder whether a truly metaphysical feeling is even possible without the disappearance of superficial forms? one reaches the center of life only by purifying it of contingent and accidental**

**elements.”**

**\- “metaphysical existentialism is born out of ecstasy in front of the world's primordial origins; it** _**is the ultimate intoxication, ecstatic bliss in the contemplation of essence.”**_

**\- “i see a form of madness, not of knowledge, in the ecstasy of life's ultimate origins. You cannot experience it except in solitude, when you feel as if you were floating above the world. solitude is the proper milieu for madness. it is noteworthy that even the skeptic can experience this kind of ecstasy. does not the madness of ecstasy reveal itself through this odd combination of certitude and essence with doubt and despair?**”

**\- “the world in which nothing is solved. to doubt and yet to live - this is a paradox, though not a tragic one, since doubt is less intense, less consuming, than despair. abstract doubt, in which** **one participates only partially, is more frequent, whereas in despair one participates totally and** **organically. not even the most organic and serious forms of doubt ever reach the intensity of despair.**  _**in comparison with despair, skepticism is characterized by a certain amount of dilettantism and superficiality. i can doubt everything, i may very well smile contemptuously at the world, but this will not prevent me from eating, from sleeping peacefully, and from marrying. in despair, whose depth one can fathom only by experiencing it, such actions are possible only with great effort**_**. On the heights of despair, nobody has the right to sleep. thus a genuinely** **desperate man cannot forget his own tragedy: his consciousness preserves the painful actuality of his subjective torment. doubt is anxiety about problems and things, and has its origins in the unsolvable nature of all big questions**_**.**_ **if such questions could be solved, the skeptic would revert to more normal states.** _**The condition of the desperate man in this respect is utterly different: if all**_

_**problems were solved, he would not be any less anxious, since his anxiety arises out of his own**_

_**subjective existence.**_ _**Despair is the state in which anxiety and restlessness are immanent to existence. nobody in despair suffers from problems, but from his own inner torment and fire.**_ **it's a pity that nothing can be solved in this world. yet there never was and there never will be anyone who would commit suicide for this reason.”**

**\- “one must descend all the circles of an inner hell to turn one's destiny into a subjective yet universal problem.”** (Kierkegaard)

**\- “only great and dangerous contradictions betoken a rich spiritual life, because only they**

**constitute a mode of realization for life's abundant inner flow. people who know only a few spiritual states and never live on the edge do not have contradictions, because their limited** **resources cannot form oppositions.”**

**\- “rich spiritual life must know chaos and the effervescent paroxysm of illness, because in them** **inspiration appears to be essential for creation and contradictions become expressions of high** **inner temperatures.** _**nobody who does not love chaos is a creator, and whoever is contemptuous of illness must not speak of the spirit.”**_

**\- “I know nothing more disgusting than death...**_**it is ironic that one fears it the more one admires it**_**. i must confess that i admire** _**death's negativity**_**. it is the only thing i can admire and yet not** **love.** _**its grandeur and infinity impress me**_**, but my despair is so vast that i don't even harbor the hope of death. how could i love death?**  _**one can only write about it in contradictory ways**_**. whoever says that he knows something definite about death shows that he has not even a** **premonition, although** _**he bears it within himself**_**. every man bears with him not only his life but also his death.”**

**\- “**_**an observation which, to my great regret, is always verifiable: only those are happy who never think or, rather, who only think about life's bare necessities, and to think about such things means not to think at all**_**.** _**true thinking resembles a demon who muddies the spring of life or a sickness which corrupts its roots. to think all the time, to raise questions, to doubt your own destiny, to feel the weariness of living, to be worn out to the point of exhaustion by thoughts and life...**_**” (Ha!)**

**\-** _**“i might become an animal who knows the history of philosophy. as to becoming superman, that**_ _**seems to me utter and ridiculous folly. could there be a solution, approximate of course, in a sort of superconsciousness? couldn't one live beyond (not just on this side, toward animality) all**_ _**complex forms of consciousness, anxiety, agony, in a sphere of life where access to eternity would no longer be pure myth?”**_

**\-** _**“what should i do? work for a social and political system, make a girl miserable? hunt for weaknesses in philosophical systems, fight for moral and esthetic ideals? it's all too little.”**_ **(me- Renunciation)**

_**\- “beyond present-day common ideals and forms, one might breathe in a superconsciousness where the intoxication of eternity would do away with the qualms of this world, and where being would be just as pure and immaterial as nonbeing.”**_

**\- “to live in a bath of fire, transfigured by its rich glow – such is the** _**state of immaterial purity**_ **where one is nothing but a dancing flame. freed from the laws of gravity,** _**life becomes illusion**_ _**or dream.”**_

_**\-**_ **“not everybody loses their innocence: therefore not everybody is unhappy...disintegration implies total loss of innocence, that lovely gift** _**destroyed by knowledge, life's enemy.**_**”**

**\- “innocence is delight in natural charm...there are only two fundamental attitudes: the naive and the heroic...innocence is no longer an option, so there only remains heroism. incapable of fulfillment and happiness... to be a hero - in the most universal sense of the word means to aspire to absolute triumph. but such triumphs come only through death.**  _**heroism means transcending life; it is a fatal leap into nothingness**_**, even though the hero may not be aware that his energy springs from a life deprived of its normal supports. all that is innocence, and does not lead to it, belongs to nothingness. can one speak of the seductions of nothingness? if we do, we must add**

**that they are much too mysterious to penetrate.”**

**\- “spirit in life is an anomaly. i have renounced so much, why should i not renounce spirit as well? but besides being an illness of life, is not renunciation first and foremost an illness of**

**the spirit?”**

**\- “i do not know what is right and what is wrong; what is allowed and what is not; i cannot judge and i cannot praise. there are no valid criteria and no consistent principles in the world...it surprises me that some people still concern themselves with a theory of knowledge. to tell the truth, i couldn't care less about the relativity of knowledge, simply because** _**the world does not**_ _**deserve to be known. at times i feel as if i had total knowledge, exhausting the content of this world; at other times the world around me does not make any sense.”**_

_**\- “the feeling of cosmic**_ **loneliness, on the other hand, stems not so much from man's subjective agony as from an awareness of the world's isolation, of objective nothingness. it is as if all the** **splendors of this world were to vanish at once, leaving behind the dull monotony of a cemetery.”**

**\- “how i would love one day to see all people, young and old, sad or happy, men and women, married or not, serious or superficial leave their homes and their work places, relinquish their duties and responsibilities, gather in the streets and** _**refuse to do anything anymore.**_ **at that moment,** **let slaves to senseless work, who have been toiling for future generations under the** _**dire delusion that they contribute to the good of humanity, avenge themselves on the mediocrity of a sterile and insignificant life, on the tremendous waste that never permitted spiritual transfiguration.**_**”** (Karma Yoga, Maya)

**\- “let ideals be declared void; beliefs, trifles; art, a lie; and philosophy, a joke.” (Nihilism, Renunciation)**

**\- “the feeling of utter confusion! not to be able to differentiate, clarify, understand, or appreciate! such a feeling would make any philosopher a poet, but not all philosophers experience it the feeling of utter confusion! not to be able to differentiate, clarify, understand, or appreciate!**  _**Such a feeling would make any philosopher a poet, but not all philosophers experience it with significant and durable intensity, for if they did, they could no longer philosophize abstractly and rigidly**_**. How a philosopher becomes a poet is like a drama. you** **fall from a world of abstractions into a whirlwind of feelings, into all the fantastic shapes** **and figures entangled in the soul. how could the actor of a complicated drama of the soul in which, all at once, erotic anticipation clashes with metaphysical anxiety, fear of death with desire for innocence, total renunciation with paradoxical heroism despair with pride, forebodings**

**of madness with longings for anonymity, screams with silence, aspiration with nothingness how** _**could he still go on philosophizing in a systematic way?**_ **There are men who started in the world**

**of abstract forms and ended in absolute confusion. therefore they can only philosophize poetically. in the state of absolute confusion, only the delights and torments of madness still** **matter.”**

**\- “grace is an illusory state in which life negates its antinomies and transcends its demonic dialectic, in which contradictions, fatality, and the consciousness of the irrevocable temporarily vanish...transcending negativity is the essential characteristic of grace.”**

**\- “only sickness gives birth to serious and deep feelings.”**

**\- “he who has not experienced absolute fear, universal anxiety, cannot understand struggle, the madness of the flesh and of death.”**

_**\- “a graceful sense of existence does not lead to metaphysical revelations, to a vision of truth, to the sense of an ending which poisons every moment of life.”**_

**\- “pity is not only inefficient; it is also insulting. and besides, how can you pity another when you** **yourself suffer ignominiously.”**

**\- “even today nobody can tell what is right or what is wrong...since reality is essentially irrational, why set rules, why distinguish the right from the wrong? morality cannot be saved; it's a mistake to believe otherwise.**  _**yet there are those who maintain that in this world pleasure and sin are minor satisfactions which enjoy only a brief triumph and that only good deeds partake of**_ _**eternity. they pretend that at the end of this world's misery, goodness and virtue will win but they have failed to see that, if eternity obliterates superficial pleasures, it does the same with virtue, good deeds, and moral actions. eternity does not lead to the triumph of either good or evil; it ravages all.”**_ **(me- Exactly! Ha! Vivekananda- maya, Tillich- doubt as being an intrinsic part of true faith, Kierkegaard and how the infinite scared him, how St. Therese said that thoughts concerning the Infinite brought on even deeper anguish)**

**\- “it is silly to condemn the epicureans in the name of eternity. how is suffering rather than pleasure going to make me immortal? from a purely objective point of view, is there any significant difference between one man's agony and another's pleasure? whether you suffer or not, nothingness will swallow you forever.” (Maya)**

**\- “the experience of eternity therefore depends on intensity of subjective feeling, and the way to eternity is to transcend the temporal...**_**every experience of eternity presupposes a leap and a transfiguration, and few and far between are those capable of the tension necessary to arrive at the blissful contemplation of the eternal.**_**”**

**\- “time with its long train of individual moments is, if not unreal, irrelevant...without temporality, life loses its dramatic character...the experience of the eternity is void of life.”**

**\- “why should i live in history, or worry about the social and cultural problems of the age?**

**i am weary of culture and history; i can no longer bring myself to embrace its torments and its aspirations.** _**We must outstrip history, and we can do so only when past, present, and future cease to be important, when where and when we live becomes a matter of indifference**_**...**_**since there is no hierarchy of life-styles, everybody and nobody is right all at the same time...**_**mankind's achievements could very well be great, but i do not care to know them.**  _**I take greater comfort in the contemplation of eternity. in this world not worth so much as a breath, the only valid relation is that between man and eternity, not between man and history.”**_

_**\- “by outstripping history, one acquires superconsciousness, an important ingredient of eternity. it takes you into the realm where contradictions and doubts lose their meaning, where you**_ _**forget about life and death. it is the fear of death that launches men on their quest for eternity...”**_

_**\-**_ **“man tends to monopolize tragedy and suffering in the world: that's why salvation**

**for him is a burning insoluble question. i am not proud to be a man, because i know only too** **well what it is to be man.** _**Only those who have not experienced this state intensely are proud of it, because they intend to become men. their delight is natural: there are among men some who are not far above plants or animals, and therefore aspire to humanity.**_ **but those who know what it means to be man long to be anything but.”**

**\- “magic is useful for small and inessential things, but powerless when confronted with metaphysical reality,** _**which requires, most of the time**_**,** _**silence**_**, something magical sensitivity is incapable of.**  _**to live with an acute consciousness of fatality, of one's own impotence in the face of life's great problems, which you cannot even pose without tragically implicating yourself in existence, means to engage directly the capital question of life, that of inaccessible and unknowable infinity.**_**”**

_**\- “you pretend that despair and agony are only preliminaries, that ideally one should overcome them if one is not to become an automaton.**_ **you think joy is the only means of salvation and you despise all others? You call the obsession with agony selfishness and find generous impulses only in joy? you offer us this joy; but how can we receive it from the outside? as long as it does not spring from our inner resources, help from the outside is quite useless. how easy it is to recommend joy to those who cannot be joyful!**  _**do all those who are so eager to promote joy realize what it means to feel and fear madness closing in, to live all your life with the tormenting presentiment of madness, to which is added the even more persistent and certain consciousness of death?**_**”**

**\- “let us live the agony fully; let us live our inner tragedy absolutely and frenetically to the very end.”**

**\- “...there is no true or false, only our spontaneous reactions.”**

**\-** _**“isn't intense subjectivity the way to attain universality, exactly as one enters eternity through the instant? men value solitude so little! they condemn the sterility of all that it has produced and give praise exclusively to social values, for they cherish the illusion that they have all contributed to their creation. they all aspire to great achievements through which they hope to attain immortality. as if they will not crumble into dust!”**_ (even Bach will be lost)

**\- “the enthusiast's ability to be constantly reborn raises him above life's demoniacal**

**temptations, the fear of nothingness, and the torments of agony. his life has no tragic dimension, because enthusiasm is the only form of life totally opaque to death. even grace - so similar to enthusiasm- has less of this irrational ignorance of death. grace is full of melancholy charm; not so enthusiasm.** _**my tremendous admiration for enthusiasts stems from my inability to comprehend how there can be such men in a world where death, nothingness, sadness, and despair keep sinister company.**_ **It makes one wonder, to see people who are never desperate.”**

**\- “the enthusiast is preeminently an unproblematic person. he understands many things without ever knowing the agonizing doubts and the chaotic sensitivity of the problematic man. the latter** **cannot solve anything, because nothing satisfies him. you will find in him neither the enthusiast's gift of abandon, his naive irrationality, nor the charming paradox of love in its purest state.”**

**\-** _**“the biblical myth of knowledge as sin is the most profound myth ever invented. the enthusiast's euphoria is due to the fact that he is unaware of the tragedy of knowledge. why not say it? true knowledge is the most tenebrous darkness.”**_

**\- “**_**the height of ecstasy is the final sensation, in which you feel you are dying because of all this light and darkness.**_ **especially weird is the fact that** _**ecstasy wipes out surrounding objects**_**,** _**familiar forms of the world**_**, until ail that is left is a monumental projection of shadow and light.** **it is hard to explain how this selection and purification takes place, why these immaterial shadows hold such sway over us.** _**how can we help attributing an absolute character to light and darkness when they are all that is left of the world's ecstasy?**_ **the frequency with which ecstasy occurs in oriental religions, as well as in other forms of** _**mysticism**_ **at all times, proves the rightness of our hypothesis.**  _**the absolute is inside oneself**_**, not outside, and ecstasy, this paroxysm**

**of interiority,** _**reveals only inner shadows and glimmers of light**_**. next to them, the charm of light** **and day fades quickly. ecstasy partakes of essence to such an extent that it gives an impression** **of metaphysical hallucination.**  _**pure essences, grasped through ecstasy, are immaterial, but their immateriality causes vertigo and obsession from which you cannot free yourself except by converting them into metaphysical principles.**_**”**

**\- “so you witnessed old age, pain, and death and told yourself that pleasure is an illusion and that the pleasure seekers do not understand the inconstancy of things.**  _**then you shunned the world, persuaded that nothing will endure.**_ **"i will not return," you proclaimed, "before i have escaped birth, old age, and death." there is much pride and suffering in every renunciation.** _**instead**_ _**of retreating discreetly, without a big show of revolt and hatred, you denounce, emphatically**_

_**and haughtily, others' ignorance and illusions; you condemn their pleasures**_**. the ascetics, who renounced life and fled into the desert, were convinced that they had overcome all human weaknesses. the belief that they had access to a subjective eternity gave them the illusion of total liberation. nonetheless,** _**their condemnation of pleasure and their contempt for humanity betray their inability to actually free themselves**_**. were i to withdraw into the most fearsome desert, renounce everything, and live in absolute solitude,** _**still I would never dream of despising men and their pleasure. since I cannot really enter eternity through renunciation and solitude, since I shall die like the rest, why despise them, why call my way the only true one? all the great prophets lack discretion and human understanding.**_ **i witness pain, old age, death, and i know that they cannot be overcome; but** _**why should i spoil another's enjoyment with my knowledge? suffering and the consciousness of its in escapability lead to renunciation; yet nothing would induce me, not even if i were to become a leper, to condemn another's joy. there is much envy in every act of condemnation.**_ _**Buddhism and christianity are the revenge and the spite of those who suffer.”**_ **(Ha!)**

_**\-**_ **“the** **thought of renunciation is so bitter that it is hard to imagine how man ever came to**

**conceive of it.**  _**he who in a moment of despair has not experienced a cold shiver, a sensation of ineluctable abandonment, cosmic death, and individual nothingness, has not experienced the terrifying preliminaries of renunciation.**_**”**

**\- “not living under the fierce desert sun, with just that one thought about eternity,** _**are we to**_

_**become saints with roofs over our heads?**_**”**

**\- “a world full of philosophers, what a terrifying prospect! they should be all wiped out so that** **life could go on naturally** **– blindly and irrationally.**  _**i hate the wisdom of these men unmoved by truths, who do not suffer with their nerves, their flesh, and their blood.**_ **i like only vital, organic truths, the offspring of our anxiety. those whose thoughts are alive are always right; there are no arguments against them. and even if there were, they would not last long. i wonder** **how there can still be men searching for the truth. do wise men not yet understand that truth cannot be?” (Taoism, Sean Carroll and others discussing the multi-verse without any discomfort whatsoever)**

**\- “once you've negated everything and done away completely with all forms of existence, once nothing can survive in the path of your negativity, who can you turn to, laughing or crying, if not** **your own self? once you have witnessed the fall of the entire world, there is nothing left but for you to fall too. the infinite character of irony cancels all of life's contents. i'm not speaking here of elegant, refined irony, born of a sense of superficial pride and superiority - the irony some use to show off their detachment from the world – but of the tragic, bitter irony of despair.** _**genuine irony replaces tears, convulsions, or even a grotesque and criminal grin.”**_

**\- “the essence of social life is injustice.” (me- very Earthly reflections on “poverty”)**

**\- “...infinity, both in time and space, leads to nothing. how can we accomplish anything in the future when we have behind us an eternity in which nothing was accomplished? if the world had had any meaning, it would have been revealed to us by now and we would know it. how can i continue to believe that it will be disclosed in the future when it has not been made manifest yet? but the world has no meaning; irrational at the core, it is, moreover, infinite. meaning is conceivable only in a finite world, where one can reach something, where there are limits to stop**

**our regression, clear points of reference, where history moves toward a goal envisioned**

**by the theory of progress.”**

**\- “to live infinity, as well as to meditate a long time upon it, is the most terrifying lesson**

**in anarchy and revolt one can ever learn.**  _**infinity shakes you to the roots of your being, disorganizes you, but it also makes you forget the petty, the contingent, and the insignificant.”**_

_**\- “how fortunate that, having lost all our hopes, we can still leap into infinity, dive into boundlessness, participate in the universal anarchy of its whirlwind!”**_

_**\-**_ **“absolute becoming, infinity destroys anything that is formed, crystallized, or finished. isn't** **music the art which best expresses infinity because it dissolves all forms into a charmingly ineffable fluidity.”**

**\- “i have always wondered why those who have produced masterpieces in these domains have not all gone mad. music more than any other art requires so much concentration that one could easily, after creative moments, lose one's mind. all great composers ought to either commit suicide or become insane at the height of their creative powers. are not all those aspiring to infinity on the road to madness? normality, abnormality, are notions that no longer mean anything. let us live in the ecstasy of infinity, let us love that which is boundless, let us destroy forms...”**

**\-** _**“since i will not die right away, nor regain my innocence, going through the same routine motions every day is sheer madness. banality must be overcome at all costs and the way cleared for transfiguration. how sad to see men bypass themselves, neglect their own destiny instead of rekindling the light they carry within them or getting drunk on their abysmal darkness!”**_ (Tillich, Tolstoy, inward)

**\- “why not abandon this futile work and begin anew without repeating the same wasteful mistake?** _**is subjective consciousness of eternity not enough?**_ **it is the feeling for eternity that the frenetic activity and trepidation of work has destroyed in us. work is the negation of eternity.** _**the more goods we acquire in the temporal realm, the more intense our external work, the less accessible and farther removed is eternity.**_**”**

**\- “**_**hence the limited perspective of active and energetic people, the banality of their thought and actions. i am not contrasting work to either passive contemplation or vague dreaminess, but to an unrealizable transfiguration**_**; nevertheless, i prefer an intelligent and observant laziness to** **intolerable,** _**terrorizing activity**_**. to awaken the modern world, one must praise laziness. the lazy man has an infinitely keener perception of metaphysical reality than the active one.” (me- non-movement, Saints are Conquerors, Underhill thinks Quietism is misconstrued as 'laziness' when in fact it's an undying participation with the Nothingness)**

**\- “sadness, the inebriation and excitement of last moments. is not everything final? what is the anxiety of nothingness if not the perverse joy of our final sadness, our exalted love for the eternity of nothingness and the transience of existence? can it really be that for us existence means exile, and nothingness, home?**  _**i must struggle against myself, fly into a rage at my destiny, blow up all**_ _**resistance to my transfiguration; let there be only my desire for light and darkness!**_  **let each one of my actions be either triumph or fall, flight or failure! let life grow and die in me with the speed of a lightning bolt!**  _**let not the pettiness and rationality of commonplace existence spoil the pleasures and torments of my inner chaos, the tragic delights of my final despair and joy!”**_

_**\- “when men can no longer bear the monotony and the banality of ordinary existence, they will find in each experience of the absolute an opportunity to commit suicide.**_ **the impossibility** **of surviving such extraordinary states of exaltation will destroy existence. no one will then doubt that it is possible to long for death after having listened to certain symphonies or admired a unique landscape.”**

**\- “ To speak of suffering as the path to love means to know nothing of suffering's satanic essence.**  _**you don't climb up the steps of suffering; you climb down. they do not lead to heaven but to hell. the darkness at the bottom of the ladder of suffering is less eternal or infinite than the blinding light at the top of the ladder of joy.**_**”**

_**\- “disjunction from the world through suffering leads to excessive interiorization and, paradoxically, to such a high level of consciousness that the world, with all its splendors and glooms, becomes exterior and transcendent.”**_ **(me- pantheistic paradox)**

_**\-**_ **“...however painful my agony, however great my isolation, the distance separating me from the world does nothing but render it more accessible.”**

**\- “there's no salvation without the immediate. but man is a being who no longer knows the immediate.” (me- Jesus and anxiety about tomorrow, says think about today. Buddha talks about the present moment, etc)**

**\-** _**“when we have persuaded ourselves that there is no truth. all salvation comes thenceforth,**_

_**even salvation through nothing.”**_

**\- “for those deprived of faith, an excess of subjectivity leads either to megalomania or self-denigration, to too much love or too much self-hatred. Either way, you spend yourself ahead of time. subjectivity makes you either god or satan.”**

**\- “man should stop being- or becoming - a rational animal. he should become a lunatic, risking everything for the sake of his dangerous fantasies, capable of exaltations, ready to die for all** **that the world has as well as for what it has not. each man's ideal should be to stop being a man. this can only be attained through absolute arbitrariness.”**

**\-** _**“nothing matters. everything is possible, and yet nothing is. all is permitted, and yet again, nothing. no matter which way we go, it is no better than any other. it is all the same whether you**_ _**achieve something or not, have faith or not, just as it is all the same whether you cry or remain**_ _**silent. there is an explanation for everything, and yet there is none. everything is both real and**_ _**unreal, normal and absurd, splendid and insipid. there is nothing worth more than anything else, nor any idea better than any other. why grow sad from one's sadness and delight**_ _**in one's joy? What does it matter whether our tears come from pleasure or pain? love your unhappiness and hate your happiness, mix everything up, scramble it all! be a snowflake dancing**_ _**in the air, a flower floating downstream! have courage when you don't need to, and be a coward**_ _**when you must be brave! who knows? you may still be a winner! and if you lose, does it really matter? is there anything to win in this world? all gain is a loss, and all loss is a gain. why always expect a definite stance, clear ideas, meaningful words?”**_

_**\- “**_**all efforts to attain happiness, on the other hand, are entirely futile.** _**you can not retrace your steps once you've taken the path to unhappiness**_**;** _**it is the path of no return**_**. from being happy, one can become unhappy, so there are more unpleasant surprises in happiness than in unhappiness. the world seems right to us when we are happy; when unhappy, we wish the world were anything but what it is. though fully aware that the source of unhappiness is in us, we nevertheless turn a personal defect into a metaphysical deficiency.”**

**\- “why do men insist on achieving something? Would it not be better if they stood still under the sun in calm and silent immobility? what is there to accomplish? why so much effort and ambition? man has forgotten the meaning of silence.”**

**\- “could morality still serve such a being-** _**probably the most generous because also the most absurd, capable of renouncing the whole world, and consequently giving away all that can be**_ _**given?**_ **generosity is incompatible with morality, that rationalization of customs, that mechanization of life.**  _**Any generous act is absurd, a renunciation unheard of in the**_

_**ordinary man, who drapes himself in morality in order to hide his vulgar nullity.**_ **all that is truly moral begins when we have done with morality. the pettiness of its laws is never more evident than in its condemnation of vice, the expression of carnal tragedy born from the presence of the spirit in the flesh. vice is the tragedy of the flesh, the flesh bursting out of its own fatality, attempting to break the shackles imprisoning its passionate impulses.”**

_**\- “then you will think it useless to express an opinion, to take a stand, to make an impression; the noises you have renounced increase the anxiety of your soul. after having struggled madly to solve all problems, after having suffered on the heights of despair, in the supreme hour of revelation, you will find that the only answer, the only reality, is silence.”**_ **(in 'nothing matters' he describes the Absurd Perspective that turns all and any action nonsensical. He also refers to being saved from acting like just another 'clown' through silence)**

**\- “a little knowledge is delightful; a lot, disgusting. the more you know, the less you want to know. he who has not suffered from knowledge has never known anything.”**

**\- “fine psychological understanding is the product of a life of self-contemplation, a life which** **sees itself in other lives as if in so many mirrors; for a psychologist, all men are fragments of himself...quickly exhausting men and their limited resources, the psychologist is easily bored, for he is not naive enough to have friends and is too self-conscious to have lovers.”**

**\- “time...becomes an ever-growing nothingness, a dilating void,** _**a threat from beyond**_**.”** 

(The Premonition of Madness- Cioran describes “ego-death” which is always said to be one of the most, if not the most, important parts of an experience of the Other, in exactly the same way as Eckhart, John of the Cross, Augustine, Luther, etc., but then goes on to describe the Nihilistic experience, which is the religious experience, as “madness”. What kind of culture would allow a 22 year old to conceive of such a terrifying experience as this to be “madness” in a pejorative sense? Jesus said the path was narrow! The Nihilistic experience is madness, but it is also God.)

## _Dynamics of Faith_

_\-_ “Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned.”

\- speaking of in the Old Testament- “They state unambiguously the character of genuine faith, the demand of total surrender to the subject of ultimate concern.” (this seems important, since is this an 'ideal' like Kierkegaard's Knight of Faith or Vivekananda's complete selflessness? Is it something that cannot seemingly be reached, but must still be thrived towards? Is this what martrys are doing? Suicides too? It seems that they are ultimately surrendering. What about Muslim 'terrorists'? Of course they would be celebrated under other value structures that begin with Islam being the ultimate concern. I know that's too vague to say that all 'islam' would resort to this, but 'terrorism' does seem justified as an ultimate concern)

\- “...the ultimate concern with 'success' and the social standing and economic power. It is the god of many people in the highly competitive western culture...even if the price is sacrifice of genuine human relations, personal conviction, and creative eros...misplaced faith is...When fulfilled, the promise of this faith proves to be empty.”

\- “Faith is not an act of any of his rational functions, as it is not an act of the unconscious, but it is an act in which both the rational and the nonrational elements of his being are transcended...It transcends them, but it does not destroy them. (Otto)

\- “'Ecstasy' means standing 'outside of oneself'- without ceasing to be oneself. (One of the Nihilist speaks of the objectivity one gets from Nihilism, I say this in my journals, I just need to find the entry date, also that quote from 'solitude' is exactly this experience. Although all alone, you have a sense of something bigger that is connected with yourself and everyone else, Shrooms, cannabis, entheogens)

\- “The reality of man's ultimate concern reveals something about his being, namely, that he is able to transcend the flux of relative and transitory experiences of his ordinary life.”

\- _“Man's experiences feelings, thoughts are conditioned and finite. They not only come and go, but their content is of finite and conditional concern...”_

_\- “Man is driven towards faith by his awareness of the infinite.”_ (Zapffe and his term 'transcendental yearning', Vivekananda saying nothing will make us ultimately content in this world of Maya)

\- Faith- “...is the passion for the infinite.”

\- Ultimate Concern- “...the ultimate is concern about what is experienced as ultimate.”

\- In reference to 'idols' which Tillich claims everything under the sun has been use as the 'ultimate' in religious history- “...a critical principle was and is at work in man's religious consciousness, namely, that which is really ultimate over against what claims to be ultimate but is only _preliminary, transitory, finite.”_ (symbolism, the ultimate concern is supposed to 'unite' the subjective, human world, with the objective, infinite realm of Divinity, according to Tillich)

\- “There is no faith without a content toward which it is directed.”

\- _“All speaking about divine matters which is not done in the state of ultimate concern is meaningless.”_  (if there is speak about the worldly, then it is meaningless with regards to the divine, which is why I find philosophy/abstractness to be a decently accurate symbol for speaking or thinking about God)

\- _“In true faith the ultimate concern is a concern about the truly ultimate; while in idolatrous faith preliminary, finite realities are elevated to the rank of ultimacy. The inescapable consequence of idolatrous faith is 'existential disappointment,' a disappointment which penetrates into the very existence of man!”_  (anything worldly must not be given any more value than a symbol, as a pretending to bridge the gap of the finite and the infinite. The disconnect, the doubt, the meaningless is always here, it is never overcome. The ones who have 'overcome' are the ones who have mistakenly, whether out of fear or just ignorance, elevated the finite to the level of the infinite. They are idolatrous. Augustine makes this finite/infinite distinction very clearly. As does Kierkegaard and the mystics who hold that even the humans who don't recognize it, are stuck in the nightmare of existence, the human condition is universal)

\- “...even an idolatrous faith can hide this consequence only for a certain time. But finally it breaks into the open.” (Nihilism, meaninglessness, will come through, eventually, hopefully. A man only comes to religion when the patchwork does not hold anymore. When everything comes crashing.

\- “The awareness of the holy is awareness of the presence of the divine, namely of the content of our ultimate concern.”

\- “It is a presence that remains mysterious in spite of its appearance, and it exercises both an attractive and a repulsive function of those who encounter it.”

\- “The human heart seeks the infinite because that is where the finite wants to rest. In the infinite it sees its own fulfillment.”

\- _“...the infinite distance of the finite from the infinite and, consequently, the negative judgment over any finite attempts to reach the infinite. The feeling of being consumed in the presence of the divine is a profound expression of man's relation to the holy.”_  (this is experienced in the mushroom trip. This experience of utter separation from the Divine, yet when on psylocibin, having a true sense of Humility in the face of something truly Other. This whole of love takes you from everything, even yourself, yet even though 'you' disintegrates, you are still 'there' somehow. All does become One. Such a counter experience from anything 'rational', anything our 'normal', boring, obnoxiously vain produces. This is not a philosophical argument, it's a call for experience. This cannot be logic chopped. The experience happened. The experience was real to me. TO ME, it's real. Now what do I do with that? Ha!)

\- “'Holy' has become identified with moral perfection...Originally, the holy has meant what is apart from the ordinary realm of things and experiences.

\- “Entering the sanctuary means encountering the holy.:

\- “...the holy has been called the 'entirely other'...”

\- “_The holy transcends this realm; this is its mystery and its unapproachable character.”_

_\- “...there is no way of reaching the infinite.”_ (necessarily its symbolism)

\- “The holy can appear as creative and as destructive.”

\- “...the terrifying and consuming element can be destructive and creative.”

\- “...the concept of the holy was changed. Holiness becomes justice and truth. It is creative and not destructive. The true sacrafice is obedience to the law. This is the line of thought which finally led to the identification of holiness with moral perfection. But when this point is reached, holiness loses its meaning as the 'sperated', the 'transcending', the 'fascinating and terrifying', the 'entirely other'. All this is gone, and the holy has become the morally good and the logically true.  _It has ceased to be the holy in the genuine sense of the word.”_

\- “...one could say that the holy originally lies below the alternative of the good and evil; that it is both divine and demonic...” (Nietzsche would say 'Beyond', and Tillich would have to have known this when writing 'below')

\- “The holy which is demonic, or ultimately destructive, is indentical wit hthe content of idolatrous faith. Idolatrous faith is still faith. The holy which is demonic is still holy.”

\- “...the danger of faith is idolatry...”

\- _“Our ultimate concern can destroy us as it can heal us.”_  (indeed, Heisman)

\- “An act of faith is an act of a finite being who is grasped by and turned to the infinite.”

\- “Faith is certain in so far as it is an experience of the holy. _But faith is uncertain in so far as the infinite to which it is related is received by the finite being._ This element of uncertainty in faith cannot be removed, it must be accepted. And the element in faith which accepts this is courage. Faith includes an element of immediate awareness which gives certainty and an element of uncertainty. To accept this is courage.”

_\- “Courage as an element of faith is the daring self-affirmation of one's own being in spite of the power of 'nonbeing' which are the heritage of everything finite.”_  (acting in the face of death; in spite of how death takes away the meaning, purpose, value of all actions. 'We all end up the same', 'if we all die, if there is no ultimate justice, then all is permitted', etc.)

_\- “The is a risk if what was considered as a matter of ultimate concern proves to be a matter or preliminary and transitory concern- as, for example, the nation. The risk to faith in one's ultimate concern is indeed the greatest risk a man can run. For if it proves to be a failure, the meaning of one's life breaks down; one surrenders oneself, including truth and justice, to something which is not worth it.”_  (this is the sick joke that is life, it seems that everyone, no matter what is doing this. Ha! That's a maddening thought. Everything around me, including myself, is part of something insane, absurd, Nihilistic)

\- _“The reaction of despair in people who have experienced the breakdown of their national claims is an irrefutable proof of the idolatrous character of their national concern. In the long run this is the inescapable result of an ultimate concern, the subject matter of which is not ultimate.”_

\- on how all concrete elements of religion must be symbolic due to the finite/infinite distinction- “A god disappears; divinity remains.”

\- “If faith is understood as belief that something is true, doubt is incompatible with the act of faith. If faith is understood as being ultimately concerned, doubt is a necessary element in it.” (finite/infinite distinction, the concrete symbols will never 'receive' the Other, the Holy 'in full')

\- “The skeptical doubt is an attitude towards all beliefs of man, from sense experiences to religious creeds. It is more an attitude than an assertion.  _For as an assertion it would conflict with itself. Even the assertion that there is no possible truth for man would be judged by the skeptical principle and could not stand as an assertion.”_ (self-refuting nature, which means that the 'negative' to be coherent, must accept that they are taking something seriously, and therefore embrace that there is something behind this 'despair over meaninglessness, loss of truth, etc.' CTB pg. 176- 'The act of accepting meaninglessness is a meaningful act. It is an act of faith', a criticism that seemingly refutes Camus)

\- on the self-refuting nature of 'skepticism'- “Genuine skeptical doubt does not use the form of an assertion. It is an attitude of actually rejecting any certainty. There, it cannot be refuted logically. It does not transform its attitude into a proposition. Such an attitude necessarily leads to either despair or cynicism, or to both alternately.  _And often, if this alternative becomes intolerable, it leads to indifference and the attempt to develop an attitude of complete unconcern...such an escape finally breaks down. This is the dynamics of skeptical doubt. It has an awakening and liberating function...”_

_\- “The despair about truth by the skeptic shows that truth is still his infinite passion.”_  (Courage to be pg. 176, this is why suffering teaches you something, i.e. how could these sorts of experiences be generated from a mindless process with no ultimate purpose and only pragmatically?)

\- _“The cynical superiority over every concrete truth shows that truth is still taken seriously and that the impact of the question of an ultimate concern is strongly felt.”_ (Again, CTB, pg. 176, exactly: how is one from of concrete worship 'less' than another? How do we criticize if we no longer have an ultimate concern for truth? Self-refuting)

_\-_ faith and doubt- “...the doubt of him who is ultimately concerned about a concrete content. One could call it existential doubt, in contrast to the methodological and the skeptical doubt. It does not question whether a special proposition is true or false. It does not reject every concrete truth, but it is aware of the element of insecurity in every existential truth.”

\- “The description of anxiety as the awareness of one's finitude is sometimes criticized as untrue from the point of view of the ordinary state of mind. Anxiety, one says, appears under special conditions but is not an ever-present implication of man's finitude.”

\- “But the underlying structure of finite life is the universal condition which makes the appearance of anxiety under special conditions possible. In the same what doubt is not a permanent experience with the act of faith. But it is always present as an element in the structure of faith.”

\- _“Many Christians, as well as other religious groups, feel anxiety, guilt and despair about what they call 'loss of faith.' But serious doubt is confirmation of faith. It indicates the seriousness of the concern, its unconditional character.”_ (again, CTB pg. 176, the seriousness in which one still takes a 'negation' turns it into a 'positive', unless sit wants to be self-refuting)

\- “How can a faith which has doubt as an element within itself be united with creedal statements of the community of faith? The answer can only be that creedal expressions of the ultimate concern of the community must include their own criticism.  _It must become obvious to them- be they liturgical, doctrinal or ethical expressions of the faith of the community- that they are not ultimate. Rather, their function is to point to the ultimate which is beyond all of them._ This is what I call the 'Protestant principle.'” (Vivekananda has the same view, since he also experiences the Divine in a 'entirely other' sort of view, rather than finite, transitory, worldly. The finite/infinite gap is unbridgeable. Hence, symbolism, i.e. everyone is an idolater)

\- on chapter two of what 'faith is not'- Tillich wants to make sure that 'faith' is not a 'low degree of knowledge', it is when all finite things do not satisfy, when there is a pull towards the infinite, where we directly experience a sense of the infinite that we feel we may be able to be part of. We create symbols to reinact, interact, etc. with this experience, but they are only symbols; the finite/infinite distinction is unbridgeable. Therefore, the ultimate concern is not with the scientific, it is not with anything finite, it is not in 'conflict' with any empirical or transitory issues. Even when rallying against the 'ultimate concern', e.g. atheists, they are affirming a sense of 'rightness' and 'truth' that is showing some form of concern or ultimacy, and needs to recognize the symbolism of faith, and know that we are all striving towards the same infinite. Tillich speaks of being grasped, I would say by the feeling of Nihilism, i.e. the absurd perspective, and therefore in the face of death/meaninglessness, in order to even despair over the human situation, must take that meaninglessness as ultimate, hence the absurd perspective. The Human is forced to make moral judgments, it cannot escape it, but this is absolutely insane in a Nihilistic world, so there must be a 'truth' out there, and infinite something.)

\- on chapter three about 'symbolism'-

_\-_ “Religiously speaking, God transcends his own name. This is why the use of his name easily becomes an abuse or blasphemy. Whatever we say about that which concerns us ultimately, whether or not we call it God, has a symbolic meaning.”

\- “In any case, he who denies God as a matter of ultimate concern affirms God, because he affirms ultimacy in his concern. God is the fundamental symbol for what concern us ultimately.” (CTB pg. 176)

\- “Here again it would be meaningless to ask whether one or another of the figures in which an ultimate concern is symbolized does 'exist.' If 'existence' refers to something which can be foiund withing the whole of reality, no divine being exists. The question is not this, but: which of the numerable symbols of faith is most adequate to the meaning of faith?  _In other words, which symbol of faith ultimately expresses the ultimate without idolatrous elements?”_

_\- “All the qualities we attribute to him, power, love, justice, are taken from finite experiences and applied symbolically to that which is beyond finitude and infinity.”_

\- “Holy things are not holy in themselves, but they point, beyond themselves to the source of all holiness, that which is of ultimate concern.”

\- _“Those who live in an unbroken mythological world feel safe and certain. They resist, often fanatically, any attempt to introduce an element of uncertainty by 'breaking the myth,' namely, by making conscious its symbolic character.”_

\- “The resistance against demythologization expresses itself in literalism...The character of the symbol to point beyond itself to something else is disregarded...The fall of Adam is localized on a special geographical point and attributed to a human individual. The virgin birth of the Messiah is understood in biological terms, ressurection and ascension as physical events...The presupposition of such literalism is that God is a being, acting in time and space, dwelling in a special place...”

“_Literalism deprives God of his ultimacy and, religiously speaking, of his majesty. It draws him down to the level of that which is not ultimate, the finite and conditional.”_

_\- “Faith, if it takes its symbolism literally, becomes idolatrous! It calls something ultimate that is less than ultimate. Faith, conscious of the symbolic character of its symbols, gives God the honor which is due to him.”_

_\-_ _“It grasps the mind with terrifying and fascinating power. It breaks into the ordinary reality, shakes it and drives it beyond itself in an ecstatic way.”_  (entheogens)

\- “Man's faith is inadequate if his whole existence is determined by something that is less than ultimate.”

\- “...to face ones's own relativity one the greatness and danger...” (courage in the face of knowing that you cannot bridge the finite/infinite gap and are therefore left with Nihilism, relativism, uncertainty, doubt, being 'wrong')

\- faith- “...the infinite tension between the absoluteness of its claim and the relativity of its life.” (Divided-self, double-mindedness, doubt, the courage that is needed to handle this sort of uncertainty/relativity)

\- “This jar of water, this piece of bread, this cup of wine, this tree, this movement of the hands, of the knees, this building, this river, this color, this word, this book, this person is a bearer of the holy. In them faith experiences the content of its ultimate concern.”

\- sacraments- “They produce awe, fascination, adoration, idolatrous distortion, criticism, replacement by other bearers of the holy.”

\- “It is the state of being grasped by the holy through a special medium.” (entheogens, Bach)

\- _“As a theoretical judgement claiming general validity, it is a meaningless combination of words. But in the correlation between the subject and the author of faith, it has meaning and truth. The outside observer can only state that there is a correlation of faith between the one who has faith and the sacramental object of his faith. But he cannot deny or affirm the validity of this correlation of faith.”_  (Vivekananda, finite/infinite gap, James and the 'only self-justifying' nature of religious experience)

_\-_ _“There is no criterion by which faith can be judged from outside the correlation of faith.”_

_\-_ _HOWEVER-_ _“The faithful can ask himself or be asked by someone else whether the medium through which he experiences ultimate concern expresses real ultimacy.”_

\- _“...the inadequacy of the finite...The human mind, however, forgets this inadequacy and identifies the sacred object with the ultimate itself. The sacramental object is taken as holy in itself. Its character as the bearer of the holy, pointing beyond itself, disappears in the act of faith. The act of faith is no longer directed toward the ultimate self, but toward that which represents the ultimate- the tree, the book, the building, the person.”_  (symbolism, Vivekananda)

\- Mystics- _“They indentified the ultimate with the ground or substance of everything- the one, the ineffable, the being above being.” The interest in mystical faith is not to reject concrete, sacramental ways of faith, but to go beyond them.”_

_\- “_Mysticism is not irrational.”

\- _“But they realized that the true content of faith in an ultimate concern can neither be identified with a piece of reality, as sacramental faith desires, nor be expressed in terms of a rational system. It is a matter of ecstatic experience, and one can only speak of the ultimate in a language which at the same times denies the possibility of speaking about it.”_ (negative theology, finite/infinite gap)

\- “How is such an experience possible if the ultimate is that which transcends all possible experience?” (Indeed! Great question! Entheogens, suffering, etc.)

\- _“In order to go into it, man must empty himself of all the finite contents of his ordinary life; he must surrender all preliminary concerns for the sake of the ultimate concern. He must transcend the division of existence...The ultimate is beyond this division, and he who wants to reach the ultimate must overcome this division in himself by meditation, contemplation and ecstasy.”_ (Vivekananda, renunciation! Entheogens, psylocibin, cannabis)

\- _“The mystic is aware of the infinite distance between the infinite and the finite, and accepts a life of preliminary stages of union with the infinite, interrupted only rarely, and perhaps never, in this life by the final ecstasy.”_ 

\- “History has shown this weakness and final emptiness of all merely secular cultures.”

\- _“The question of faith is not Moses or Jesus or Mohammed; the question is: Who expresses most adequately one's ultimate concern? The conflict between religions is not a conflict between forms of belief, but it is a conflict between expressions of our ultimate concern.”_ (Vivekananda)

\- “The ultimate shall always be present and remembered even in the smallest activities of the ordinary life.”

\- “It is this humanist faith of the moral type (moral demands, rather than rituals or ascetic practices, as with the mystical type of faith) which was taken over by the revolutionary movement of the proletarian masses in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Its dynamic is visible everyday in our present period. As for every faith, the utopian form of the humanist faith is a state of ultimate concern. _This gives tremendous power to good and evil._ (the opposite of any mystical type of faith, e.g. Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Tolstoy, Vivekananda, Cioran, any Nihilist, mystic, other/worldly distinction, finite/infinite gap)

_\-_ “Faith, in the New Testament, is the state of being grasped by the divine Spirit.” (being grasped, as Kierkegaard felt, others did as well, that this was something that was 'objectively' getting thrown onto them, it felt out of their control. The experience of Nihilism is something that is ultimately terrifying and overwhelming, i.e. grasps you)

\- “A faith which destroys reason destroys itself and the humanity of man. For only a being who has the structure of reason is able to be ultimately concerned, to distinguish ultimate and preliminary concerns, to understand the unconditional commands of the ethical imperative, and to be aware of the presence of the holy.” (faith and reason are not in conflict, science and religion are not in conflict. If they are, it's only superficially and due to naive misunderstandings or conceptions of existence/the human condition/the Divine)

_\-_ _“Man's reason is finite; it moves within finite relations when dealing with the universe and with man himself. All cultural activities in which he shapes his world have this character of finitude. Therefore, they are not matters of ultimate concern.”_

\- “Man experiences a belonging to the infinite, which, however, is neither a part of himself nor something in his power. _It must grasp him, and if it does, it is a matter of infinite concern. Man is finite, man's reason lives in preliminary concerns; but man is also aware of his potential infinity, and this awareness appears as his ultimate concern.”_

\- “Reason can be fulfilled only if it is driven beyond the limits of its finitude, and _experiences the presence of the ultimate, the holy. Without such an experience, reason exhausts itself and its finite content. Finally, it becomes filled with irrational or demonic contents and is destroyed by them.”_ (is this me? I agree with this, with Mckenna, that it is about experience. I need to do mushrooms again. Another experiment is in order, Heisman is a testament to this)

\- “First, it must be acknowledged that man is in a state of estrangement from his true nature.”

\- _“The criterion of the truth of faith, therefore, is that it implies an element of self-negation. That symbol is most adequate which expresses not only the ultimate but also it own lack of ultimacy.”_

_\-_ “The criterion contains a Yes- it does not reject any truth of faith in whatever form it may appear in the history of faith- and it contains a No- _it does not accept any truth of faith as ultimate except the one that no man posses it.”_ (Vivekananda- more sects of religion, the better, they all point beyond themselves, if they are not idolatrous, Karma Yoga, believe nothing/disbelieve everything. I could use cannabis, while others may not, I cannot criticize others for their 'brand' of faith, as long as they are only using these symbols as a 'latter' to God, to the Ultimate)

\- on being 'grasped'- “Without some participation in the object of one's ultimate concern, it is not possible to be concerned about it. In this sense ebvery act of faith presupposes participation in that toward which it is directed. _Without a preceding experience of the ultimate no faith in the ultimate can exist._  The mystical type of faith has emphasized this the most strongly."

\- _"Without hte manifestation of God in man the question of God and faith in God are not possible. There is no faith without participation!"_ (participation! Turning inward, contemplation, meditation, solitude)

\- "He who has faith is seperated from the object of his faith. Otherwise he would possess it...But the human situation, its finitude and estrangement, prevents man's participation in the ultimate without both the seperation and the promis of faith. _Here the limist of mysticism becomes visible;_ 

_it neglects the human predicament and the separation of man from the ultimate. There is no faith without separation.”_  (the entire thought of Tillich rests on this finite/infinite distinction that is unbridgeable, CTB pg. 178- 'the experience of meaninglessness is more radical thatn mysticism. Therefore it transcends the mystical experience'- whether meaninglessness is 'more radical' or not is one question; what is not disputed is that meaninglessness is more prominent than the mystical experience, doubt shows how important we take our concern)

\- “Out of the element of participation follows the certainty of faith; out of the element of separation follows the doubt in faith.”

\- “Sometimes doubt conquers faith, but it still contains faith. _Otherwise it would be indifference.”_

\- “Since the life of faith is life in the state of ultimate concern and no human being can exist completely without such a concern, we can say: _Neither faith nor doubt can be eliminated from man as man.”_

_\-_ “The danger of this method, of course, is that the faith, _meditated in education_, will remain a traditional attitude and never break through to a state of living faith. However, if this causes people to become hesitant about communicating any of the given symbols and to wait until independent questions about the meaning of life have arisen, it can lead to a powerful life of faith, _but it also can lead to emptiness, to cynicism and, in reaction to it, to idolatrous forms of ultimate concern.”_  (Vivekananda, direct experience, psylocibin, cannabis, academic philosophy is a joke)

\- _“It is experienced in passion, anxiety, despair, ecstasy.”_

_\-_ “In the mystical literature the 'vision of God is...In the complete reunion with the divine ground of being, the element of distance is overcome and with it uncertainty, doubt, courage and risk. The finite is taken into the infinite; it is not extinguished, but it is not separated either.  _This is not the ordinary human condition._  To the state of separated finitude belong faith and the courage to risk. _The risk of faith is the concrete content of one's ultimate concern._” (psylocibin is the mystical experience that does remove doubt, faith, courage, etc. The Nihilism of everyday experience is more 'prevalent' as Tillich mentions in both _Faith_ and _Courage_ pg. 178)

_\- “We are never able to bridge the infinite distance between the infinite and the finite from the side of the finite. This alone makes the courage of faith possible. The risk of failure, of error and of idolatrous distortion can be taken, because the failure cannot separate us from what is our ultimate concern.”_ (sickness unto death, the doubt, the despair does not end, does not cease, it is omnipresent in the finite world)

\- “The ultimate concern gives depth, direction and unity to all other concerns and, with them, to the whole personality.”

\- _“Ultimate concern is passionate concern; it is a matter of infinite passion.”_ (Vivekananda speaks of the thief left in the room with gold, the boy who has his head held under water, going 'mad' for God as Plato and Cioran testify to, Vivekananda also mentions that the religious believers around us are ot infinitely passionate about God, as Kierkegaard, Tolstoy, Nietzsche all felt as well)

_\-_ _“The body can participate both in vital ecstasy and in asceticism leading to spiritual ecstasy.”_

\- “The objects of modern secular idolatry, such as nation and success, have shown healing power, not only by the magic fascination of a leader, a slogan or a promise but also by the fulfillment of otherwise unfulfilled strivings for a meaningful life. But the basis for integration is too narrow.”

\- Idolatrous faith- _“Spiritual creativity shows an increasingly shallow and empty character, because no infinite meaning gives depth to it. The passion of faith is transformed into the suffering of unconquered doubt and despair, and in many cases into an escape to neurosis and psychosis.”_ (the poison of naturalism)

\- “One is ultimately concerned only about something to which one essentially belongs and from which one is existentially separated.”

_\- “Mystical love unites by negation of the self. Ethical love transforms by affirmation of the self. The sphere of activities following from mystical love is predominantly ascetic. The sphere of activities following from ethical love is predominantly formative”_ (is this the difference between jnana and bhakti/karm yoga?)

\- “That which is based on an ultimate concern is not exposed to destruction by preliminary concerns and the lack of their fulfillment.”

\- “Without symbols in which the holy is experienced as present, the experience of the holy vanishes.”

_\- “If the myth is understood literally, philosophy must reject it as absurd. It must demythologize the sacred stories, transform the myth into a philosophy of religion and finally into a philosophy without religion.”_  (Vivekananda- _The Necessity of Religion_, particularly the last two pages, an 'infinite religion')

_\-_ “...no one is completely without an ultimate concern.” (in order to negate the claim of not having an ultimate concern, you'd have to ironically revolt against ultimate concerns, therefore putting a positive notion onto the lack of having an ultimate concern, i.e. showing ultimate concern, i.e. the self-contradictory nature of nihilism) (me, years later 2024: You can have it both ways, Tillich. You can't rant and rave about how a truly 'ultimate concern' is that which Is Infinite in nature. Unless, since I'm not reading directly from the book, maybe I am narrowing him down to much, and this criticism of mine is moot. Possible. I'll have to look into it, or not. But if I'm correct, then Tillich is wrong to state "Everyone has an ultimate concern". This sounds more like a tagline or talking point, or a "got'cha" sort of phrasing. This could be just one, of many, of the examples as to why I'm not convinced that Tillich took his own message seriously. Seriously? I'm a sense. But not "to heart". My suspicion is that he hoped...that's all. If he didn't, then he was able to pull the experiences of Nihilism out from others in his studying, and espouse them as if he confronted them first hand. Like everything else, I have my doubts. The latter seems more unreasonable than the former. what's "unreasonable" mean? ha! 2024 brings no such thing as clarity.)

\- “Faith is a concept- and a reality- which is difficult to grasp and to describe.”

### _The Courage To Be_

\- Pg. 175  _“The answer must accept, as its precondition, the state of meaninglessness. It is not an answer if it demands the removal of this state; for that is just what cannot be done. He who is in the grip of doubt and meaninglessness cannot liberate himself from this grip...if one does not try to escape the question...In this situation the meaning of life is reduced to despair about the meaning of life.”_ (this is the thesis/conclusion(?) of the entire book)
